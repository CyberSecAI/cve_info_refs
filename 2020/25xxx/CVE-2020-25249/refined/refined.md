The provided content describes a vulnerability in Hyland OnBase versions 19.x and below. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The core issue is that Hyland OnBase relies on the client-side to initiate logging of actions. This means the client is responsible for specifically calling server-side logging mechanisms for a log entry to be written.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Insufficient logging:** Malicious actions are not logged by default, as logging depends on client-side requests.
    *   **Client-side logging reliance**: The system is designed so that the client is responsible for logging, which is easily bypassed.
    *   **Lack of server-side logging**:  The server does not log the actions it performs, it relies on the client request to log.
    *   **Arbitrary log injection:** Attackers can write arbitrary data to server logs, including fake/spoofed attacks and denial of service attacks that bombard the logging mechanism with data.

*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Hiding malicious activities**: Attackers, both authorized and unauthorized, can hide their actions by simply dropping the client's log request, meaning their actions are not recorded.
    *   **Spoofing log entries**: Attackers can create fake entries to make it appear as if someone else is performing an attack or to cause "log blindness" that hides the real malicious activity. This can also lead to denial of service by overwhelming the logging mechanism with data.
    *  **Circumventing auditing requirements:** In industries like government, medical, and finance, where detailed logging is legally required, attackers can bypass logging to access sensitive information without being recorded, thus circumventing compliance requirements.

*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **Network-level manipulation**: By intercepting the network traffic, attackers can drop the log request packets (SOAP requests) from the client to the server.
    *   **Malicious client use**:  Malicious users can manipulate their client application (e.g., Unity client) to not send logging requests to the server.
    *   **Arbitrary log data injection:** Attackers can send crafted requests to the server to insert malicious or false log entries.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate network traffic between the OnBase client and the server.
    *   **OnBase client access:** The attacker can also be an authorized user of the system with access to an OnBase client (e.g. Unity client) or be able to control a client on the network.
    *   **Knowledge of the system:** Basic understanding of the client-server interaction and the logging mechanism is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass auditing, making it difficult to detect malicious actions and hindering security incident response.
