Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25879

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the "Manage Users" feature of Codoforum version 5.0.2. Specifically, when editing a user's username, the application does not adequately sanitize the input. Instead of HTML entity encoding the output, it only attempts to remove script tags. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The injected payload is saved in the database and executed each time the vulnerable page is accessed by a user.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application's attempt to remove script tags is inadequate, as it doesn't protect against other XSS vectors, such as the `<img>` tag with an `onerror` handler.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application fails to HTML entity encode the user-provided input before displaying it on the page, allowing the injected script to be interpreted by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies and hijack the victim's session.
- **Account Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate the victim's account, steal credentials, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the appearance of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the Codoforum application.
- **User Input:** The attack vector is user-provided input through the "Edit Username" functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel.
- **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker must be able to access the "Manage Users" feature in the admin panel.
- **Knowledge of XSS Vectors:** The attacker must know how to construct a malicious payload that can bypass basic filtering.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content gives a specific example payload (`">< img src=xx onerror= alert(document.domain) >`) which demonstrates a successful XSS attack bypassing the application's basic script tag removal.
- The vulnerability is specifically present in the "Users" section of the Codoforum's admin management feature.
- The content suggests that the removal of script tags alone is not sufficient protection against XSS, and recommends HTML entity encoding as a better approach.
