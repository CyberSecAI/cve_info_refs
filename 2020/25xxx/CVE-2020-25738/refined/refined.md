Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25738

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) where its credential theft protection mechanism can be bypassed using DLL injection. The software fails to prevent a malicious DLL from being injected into protected processes, allowing for the circumvention of access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Protection of Process Memory:** The EPM does not prevent the injection of a custom DLL into monitored processes, specifically web browsers like Google Chrome, which store sensitive information such as passwords.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** The DLL injection effectively bypasses file access restrictions imposed by CyberArk EPM, allowing the injected code to read and copy protected files (e.g., password databases).
*   **Inadequate Threat Detection:** The product fails to detect or block the malicious activity of the injected DLL, particularly the copying of sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can successfully steal user credentials stored by web browsers, including usernames, passwords and access tokens.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Stolen credentials can be used to gain access to other systems and services, leading to lateral movement within a network.
*   **Data Breach:** The theft of user credentials can lead to a wider data breach, exposing sensitive information.
*   **Bypass Security Mechanisms:** Attackers can bypass the protection mechanisms provided by CyberArk EPM, rendering it ineffective in preventing credential theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DLL Injection:** The primary attack vector involves the injection of a custom-built DLL into the memory space of a protected application (e.g., the web browser).
*   **Executable Loader:** A custom loader application is used to inject the malicious DLL into the target process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create and compile a DLL:** An attacker must possess the skills to create a custom DLL with malicious code.
*   **Ability to compile an executable:** An attacker must possess the skills to create a loader executable that performs DLL injection.
*   **Access to the target machine:**  The attacker must have a foothold on the target machine where CyberArk EPM is installed, in order to execute the loader and perform DLL injection.
*  **Local administrator privilege:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the loader application, which requires sufficient privileges.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker creates a DLL that includes code to copy the target file (e.g., Chrome's login data) to another location.
*   A separate loader application is used to inject this DLL into the target process.
*   The DLL uses the `CopyFileA` function to copy the protected file.
*   The loader uses `OpenProcess`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory` and `CreateRemoteThread` to inject the DLL.
*   Once injected, the DLL executes its malicious function within the security context of the targeted application.
