Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-25144:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to the unrestricted possibility of loading any file with the `.inc.php` extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Unrestricted File Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for path traversal using `../` sequences to access files outside the intended web root.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `app` parameter in the GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including arbitrary `.inc.php` files, an attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the server. This occurs if the included files contain malicious PHP code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access sensitive information by including configuration files, database credentials, or source code files, which are not meant to be exposed.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete server compromise, allowing an attacker to control the system, access data, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/apps/` endpoint with the `app` parameter containing a path to a local file.
    Example: `GET /apps/?app=../../../includes/polling/wmi HTTP/1.1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and path traversal techniques.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided example request includes the file `/var/opt/observium/includes/pooling/wmi.inc.php`, demonstrating that files outside the web root can be accessed.
*   The server response shows a partial output of the included file, confirming the LFI vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is located in the application's `/apps` component.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Observium Professional, Enterprise & Community versions up to 20.8.10631
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Maciej Doma≈Ñski of the AFINE.com team.
*   The provided references include links to the Acunetix blog and OWASP page on Local File Inclusion for further reading about this vulnerability.

**Summary**
The provided information indicates a clear Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Observium, which can be exploited by authenticated users to achieve Remote Code Execution. This is due to a lack of input validation on the app parameter and inadequate restrictions on file access, enabling path traversal.
