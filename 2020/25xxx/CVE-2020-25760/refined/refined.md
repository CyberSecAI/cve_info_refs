Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25760:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation on the `rid` parameter in the `front.php` file of the Visitor Management System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize the `rid` parameter before using it in a database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (extraction of sensitive information from the database).
    - Data modification/deletion.
    - Potential compromise of the entire system depending on database privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `rid` parameter in the `front.php` file's GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- While the provided exploit initially requires authentication, it notes that the vulnerability can be exploited pre-authentication with a slight modification to the server's response. Therefore, an authenticated user is not necessarily needed for exploitation.

**More Details than CVE:**
The provided content includes:
- Specific file (`front.php`) and parameter (`rid`) vulnerable to SQL injection
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- An example HTTP request showing the vulnerable parameter
- A method to exploit the vulnerability using sqlmap
- Notes that the vulnerability can be exploited pre-authentication
