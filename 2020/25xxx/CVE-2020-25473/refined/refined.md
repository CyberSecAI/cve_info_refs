Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-25473:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The session cookie for "News Script PHP Pro" is missing the `HttpOnly` flag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing `HttpOnly` flag on the session cookie. This allows client-side scripts to access the cookie.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious JavaScript code running on the client's browser can access and read the session cookie.
- If the session cookie is compromised, an attacker could potentially impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability could be used to inject malicious JavaScript into the application. The injected script could then access the session cookie.
- An attacker could trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage which would execute JavaScript to steal the cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application (e.g., via XSS).
- Alternatively, the attacker could have a user visit a page under their control to execute JavaScript.
