The provided content describes three vulnerabilities in MonoCMS Blog 1.0, but only one of them is relevant to the specified CVE-2020-25985.

**Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary File Deletion (Authenticated)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows an authenticated user to delete arbitrary files on the server through directory traversal in the `delimg` parameter of an HTTP request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `delimg` parameter, allowing attackers to use `..` sequences to navigate outside the intended directory.
    *   **Insecure File Deletion:** The application deletes files based on user-controlled input, without proper validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can delete any file on the server, potentially leading to data loss, service disruption, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `/uploads` endpoint with a malicious `delimg` parameter containing path traversal sequences and the path of the file to delete.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.

**Vulnerability 2: Account Takeover (CSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application's password change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CSRF:** The application doesn't implement CSRF protection mechanisms.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can change a victim's password without their knowledge or consent, leading to account takeover.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a request that changes the victim's password, and lures the victim to open this page while logged in.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application and be able to trick a victim user into clicking on a malicious link/page.

**Vulnerability 3: Sensitive Information Disclosure (Hardcoded Credentials)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application includes hardcoded admin and user hashes in the `log.xml` file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application stores sensitive credentials directly in the source code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application by cracking the hardcoded hashes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker obtains the source code of the application and locates the log.xml file to obtain credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs access to the application's source code.
