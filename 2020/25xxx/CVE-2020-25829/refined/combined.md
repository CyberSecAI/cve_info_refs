# PowerDNS Recursor: Denial of service — GLSA **202012-19**

A vulnerability in PowerDNS Recursor could lead to a Denial of
Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dns/pdns-recursor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.5** |

### Background

PowerDNS Recursor is a high-end, high-performance resolving name server.

### Description

It was discovered that it was possible to update the DNSSEC validation

DNSSEC validation.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PowerDNS Recursor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/pdns-recursor-4.3.5"

```

| [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1173302#c4)  Fergal Mc Carthy   2020-06-26 20:01:37 UTC  ``` Reviewing the 4.1.16 version of the patch I noticed that it doesn't apply to the Devel:Cloud:8 & Devel:Cloud:9 4.1 based packages. Digging a little deeper I realised that this CVE is relevant to the pdns-recursor package which packages up the PowerDNS Recursor server as per <https://doc.powerdns.com/recursor/changelog/4.1.html>, and not the pdns package (included in SOC 8 & 9) which packages the PowerDNS Authoritative server as per <https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/changelog/4.1.html>.  As such I'm not sure that any work needs to be undertaken for SOC 8 or 9. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1173302#c5)  Keith Berger   2020-06-29 13:14:04 UTC  ``` Security, please review and see if more work is needed from the Cloud team ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1173302#c6)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-07-01 12:55:28 UTC  ``` Now public through <https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2020-04.html> ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1173302#c7)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-07-01 20:10:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1173302) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/818168> Factory / pdns-recursor ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1173302#c8)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-07-01 21:00:08 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1173302) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/818174> 15.1+15.2+Backports:SLE-12-SP1+Backports:SLE-15-SP1 / pdns-recursor ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1173302#c9)  Adam Majer   2020-07-02 09:01:54 UTC  ``` Bug public. Security advisory for pdns-recursor.  <https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2020-04.html>   PowerDNS Security Advisory 2020-04: Access restriction bypass    CVE: CVE-2020-14196   Date: July 1st 2020   Affects: PowerDNS Recursor up to and including 4.3.1, 4.2.2 and 4.1.16   Not affected: 4.3.2, 4.2.3, 4.1.17   Severity: Low   Impact: Access restriction bypass   Exploit: This problem can be triggered by sending HTTP queries   Risk of system compromise: No   Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version   Workaround: Disable the webserver, set a password or an API key. Additionally, restrict the binding address using the webserver-address setting to local addresses only and/or use a firewall to disallow web requests from untrusted sources reaching the webserver listening address.  An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where the ACL applied to the internal web server via webserver-allow-from is not properly enforced, allowing a remote attacker to send HTTP queries to the internal web server, bypassing the restriction.  In the default configuration the API webserver is not enabled. Only installations using a non-default value for webserver and webserver-address are affected. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1173302#c10)  Adam Majer   2020-07-02 09:03:08 UTC  ``` Bug fixes submitted to all maintained codestreams.

# PowerDNS Security Advisory 2020-07: Cache pollution[Â¶](#powerdns-security-advisory-2020-07-cache-pollution "Permalink to this headline")

* CVE: CVE-2020-25829
* Date: 13th of October 2020
* Affects: PowerDNS Recursor up to and including 4.3.4, 4.2.4 and 4.1.17
* Not affected: 4.3.5, 4.2.5, 4.1.18
* Severity: High
* Impact: Denial of service
* Exploit: This problem can be triggered by sending DNS queries
* Risk of system compromise: No
* Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version
* Workaround: Filter ANY queries to prevent them from reaching the
  recursor.

An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where a remote attacker
can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the
âBogusâ DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC
âSecureâ state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of
service for installations that always validate (dnssec=validate)
and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is
enabled (dnssec=process).

| [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1177383#c6)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-10-13 11:28:25 UTC  ``` via oss-security:  Hello!,  Today we are releasing PowerDNS Recursor 4.3.5, 4.2.5. and 4.1.18, containing a security fix for CVE-2020-25829[1]:  An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where a remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the Bogus DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC Secure state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service for installations that always validate (dnssec=validate) and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process). The severity is high for these cases.  As usual, there were also other smaller enhancements and bugfixes. Please refer to the 4.3.5 changelog[2], 4.2.5 changelog[3] and 4.1.18 changelog[4] for details.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-25767.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-25862.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-25829 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25829)

#### Description

An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.1.18, 4.2.x before 4.2.5, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. A remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the Bogus DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC Secure state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service for installation that always validate (dnssec=validate), and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process).
