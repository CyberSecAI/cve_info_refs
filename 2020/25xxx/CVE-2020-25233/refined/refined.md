- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The firmware update of affected devices contains the private RSA key used for encryption of communication with the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inclusion of a private RSA key within the firmware update, leading to a hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could extract the private key, potentially allowing them to decrypt communication with the device or impersonate the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required, as the attacker needs to obtain the firmware update.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the device's firmware update.
