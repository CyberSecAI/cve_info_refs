This update corrects a regression in some Xen virtual machine
environments.  For reference the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-9445

    A potential out-of-bounds read was discovered in the F2FS
    implementation.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could potentially use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to read sensitive information.

CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074

    Navid Emamdoost discovered potential memory leaks in the ath9k and
    ath9k_htc drivers.  The security impact of these is unclear.

CVE-2019-19448

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free, and could be triggered by crafted filesystem
    images.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12351

    Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in
    the way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled.  A remote attacker
    within a short distance, knowing the victim's Bluetooth device
    address, can send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of
    service or possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel
    privileges.

CVE-2020-12352

    Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation.
    Stack memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP
    packets.  A remote attacker within a short distance, knowing the
    victim's Bluetooth device address address, can retrieve kernel
    stack information.

CVE-2020-12655

    Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system
    hang.  An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-12771

    Zhiqiang Liu reported a bug in the bcache block driver that could
    lead to a system hang.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-12888

    It was discovered that the PCIe Virtual Function I/O (vfio-pci)
    driver allowed users to disable a device's memory space while it
    was still mapped into a process.  On some hardware platforms,
    local users or guest virtual machines permitted to access PCIe
    Virtual Functions could use this to cause a denial of service
    (hardware error and crash).

CVE-2020-14305

    Vasily Averin of Virtuozzo discovered a potential heap buffer
    overflow in the netfilter nf_contrack_h323 module.  When this
    module is used to perform connection tracking for TCP/IPv6, a
    remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code execution with
    kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-14314

    A bug was discovered in the ext4 filesystem that could lead to an
    out-of-bound read.  A local user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2020-14331

    A bug was discovered in the VGA console driver's soft-scrollback
    feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On a system
    with a custom kernel that has CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK
    enabled, a local user with access to a console could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14356, CVE-2020-25220

    A bug was discovered in the cgroup subsystem's handling of socket
    references to cgroups.  In some cgroup configurations, this could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user might be able to use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

    The original fix for this bug introudced a new security issue,
    which is also addressed in this update.

CVE-2020-14386

    Or Cohen discovered a bug in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  A
    local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14390

    Minh Yuan discovered a bug in the framebuffer console driver's
    scrollback feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On
    a system using framebuffer consoles, a local user with access to a
    console could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    The scrollback feature has been disabled for now, as no other fix
    was available for this issue.

CVE-2020-15393

    Kyungtae Kim reported a memory leak in the usbtest driver.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-16166

    Amit Klein reported that the random number generator used by the
    network stack might not be re-seeded for long periods of time,
    making e.g. client port number allocations more predictable.  This
    made it easier for remote attackers to carry out some network-
    based attacks such as DNS cache poisoning or device tracking.

CVE-2020-24490

    Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation that
    can lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On systems with a Bluetooth 5
    hardware interface, a remote attacker within a short distance can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-25211

    A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem.  A local attacker
    able to inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2020-25212

    A bug was discovered in the NFSv4 client implementation that could
    lead to a heap buffer overflow.  A malicious NFS server could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute arbitrary code on the client.

CVE-2020-25284

    It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver allowed
    tasks running as uid 0 to add and remove rbd devices, even if they
    dropped capabilities.  On a system with the rbd driver loaded,
    this might allow privilege escalation from a container with a task
    running as root.

CVE-2020-25285

    A race condition was discovered in the hugetlb filesystem's sysctl
    handlers, that could lead to stack corruption.  A local user
    permitted to write to hugepages sysctls could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  By default only the root user can do this.

CVE-2020-25641

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the block layer that could lead to
    an infinite loop.  A local user with access to a raw block device
    could use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU use and
    possible system hang).

CVE-2020-25643

    ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the
    hdlc_ppp module.  Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr()
    function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.

CVE-2020-26088

    It was discovered that the NFC (Near Field Communication) socket
    implementation allowed any user to create raw sockets.  On a
    system with an NFC interface, this allowed local users to evade
    local network security policy.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.240-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.9.229-4.9.240 inclusive.

dm cache: remove all obsolete writethrough-specific code
commit 9958f1d9a04efb3db19134482b3f4c6897e0e7b8 upstream.
Now that the writethrough code is much simpler there is no need to track
so much state or cascade bio submission (as was done, via
writethrough\_endio(), to issue origin then cache IO in series).
As such the obsolete writethrough list and workqueue is also removed.

dm cache: submit writethrough writes in parallel to origin and cache
commit 2df3bae9a6543e90042291707b8db0cbfbae9ee9 upstream.
Discontinue issuing writethrough write IO in series to the origin and
then cache.
Use bio\_clone\_fast() to create a new origin clone bio that will be
mapped to the origin device and then bio\_chain() it to the bio that gets
remapped to the cache device. The origin clone bio does \_not\_ have a
copy of the per\_bio\_data -- as such check\_if\_tick\_bio\_needed() will not
be called.
The cache bio (parent bio) will not complete until the origin bio has
completed -- this fulfills bio\_clone\_fast()'s requirements as well as
the requirement to not complete the original IO until the write IO has
completed to both the origin and cache device.

genirq/affinity: Make affinity setting if activated opt-in
commit f0c7baca180046824e07fc5f1326e83a8fd150c7 upstream.
John reported that on a RK3288 system the perf per CPU interrupts are all
affine to CPU0 and provided the analysis:
"It looks like what happens is that because the interrupts are not per-CPU
in the hardware, armpmu\_request\_irq() calls irq\_force\_affinity() while
the interrupt is deactivated and then request\_irq() with IRQF\_PERCPU |
IRQF\_NOBALANCING.
Now when irq\_startup() runs with IRQ\_STARTUP\_NORMAL, it calls
irq\_setup\_affinity() which returns early because IRQF\_PERCPU and
IRQF\_NOBALANCING are set, leaving the interrupt on its original CPU."
This was broken by the recent commit which blocked interrupt affinity
setting in hardware before activation of the interrupt. While this works in
general, it does not work for this particular case. As contrary to the
initial analysis not all interrupt chip drivers implement an activate
callback, the safe cure is to make the deferred interrupt affinity setting
at activation time opt-in.
Implement the necessary core logic and make the two irqchip implementations
for which this is required opt-in. In hindsight this would have been the
right thing to do, but ...

genirq/affinity: Handle affinity setting on inactive interrupts correctly
commit baedb87d1b53532f81b4bd0387f83b05d4f7eb9a upstream.
Setting interrupt affinity on inactive interrupts is inconsistent when
hierarchical irq domains are enabled. The core code should just store the
affinity and not call into the irq chip driver for inactive interrupts
because the chip drivers may not be in a state to handle such requests.
X86 has a hacky workaround for that but all other irq chips have not which
causes problems e.g. on GIC V3 ITS.
Instead of adding more ugly hacks all over the place, solve the problem in
the core code. If the affinity is set on an inactive interrupt then:
- Store it in the irq descriptors affinity mask
- Update the effective affinity to reflect that so user space has
a consistent view
- Don't call into the irq chip driver
This is the core equivalent of the X86 workaround and works correctly
because the affinity setting is established in the irq chip when the
interrupt is activated later on.
Note, that this is only effective when hierarchical irq domains are enabled
by the architecture. Doing it unconditionally would break legacy irq chip
implementations.
For hierarchial irq domains this works correctly as none of the drivers can
have a dependency on affinity setting in inactive state by design.
Remove the X86 workaround as it is not longer required.

khugepaged: retract\_page\_tables() remember to test exit
commit 18e77600f7a1ed69f8ce46c9e11cad0985712dfa upstream.
Only once have I seen this scenario (and forgot even to notice what forced
the eventual crash): a sequence of "BUG: Bad page map" alerts from
vm\_normal\_page(), from zap\_pte\_range() servicing exit\_mmap();
pmd:00000000, pte values corresponding to data in physical page 0.
The pte mappings being zapped in this case were supposed to be from a huge
page of ext4 text (but could as well have been shmem): my belief is that
it was racing with collapse\_file()'s retract\_page\_tables(), found \*pmd
pointing to a page table, locked it, but \*pmd had become 0 by the time
start\_pte was decided.
In most cases, that possibility is excluded by holding mmap lock; but
exit\_mmap() proceeds without mmap lock. Most of what's run by khugepaged
checks khugepaged\_test\_exit() after acquiring mmap lock:
khugepaged\_collapse\_pte\_mapped\_thps() and hugepage\_vma\_revalidate() do so,
for example. But retract\_page\_tables() did not: fix that.
The fix is for retract\_page\_tables() to check khugepaged\_test\_exit(),
after acquiring mmap lock, before doing anything to the page table.
Getting the mmap lock serializes with \_\_mmput(), which briefly takes and
drops it in \_\_khugepaged\_exit(); then the khugepaged\_test\_exit() check on
mm\_users makes sure we don't touch the page table once exit\_mmap() might
reach it, since exit\_mmap() will be proceeding without mmap lock, not
expecting anyone to be racing with it.

sh: landisk: Add missing initialization of sh\_io\_port\_base
[ Upstream commit 0c64a0dce51faa9c706fdf1f957d6f19878f4b81 ]
The Landisk setup code maps the CF IDE area using ioremap\_prot(), and
passes the resulting virtual addresses to the pata\_platform driver,
disguising them as I/O port addresses. Hence the pata\_platform driver
translates them again using ioport\_map().
As CONFIG\_GENERIC\_IOMAP=n, and CONFIG\_HAS\_IOPORT\_MAP=y, the
SuperH-specific mapping code in arch/sh/kernel/ioport.c translates
I/O port addresses to virtual addresses by adding sh\_io\_port\_base, which
defaults to -1, thus breaking the assumption of an identity mapping.
Fix this by setting sh\_io\_port\_base to zero.

For the particular case that our systems detected, CC is set to
the following:

The handle\_irq\_event\_\* functions are expected to be called with interrupts

Use a event spinlock to protect event handler from being interrupted.
Note, that there are only two users of this GPIO and ADC drivers and both of

These if statements are supposed to be true if we ended the

don't work.
In the first loop, we increment "i" after the "if (i == unit)" condition
so we don't necessarily know that "i" is not equal to unit at the end of
the loop.
In the second loop we exit when mode is not pointing to a valid

i2c: rcar: avoid race when unregistering slave
[ Upstream commit c7c9e914f9a0478fba4dc6f227cfd69cf84a4063 ]
Due to the lockless design of the driver, it is theoretically possible
to access a NULL pointer, if a slave interrupt was running while we were
unregistering the slave. To make this rock solid, disable the interrupt
for a short time while we are clearing the interrupt\_enable register.
This patch is purely based on code inspection. The OOPS is super-hard to
trigger because clearing SAR (the address) makes interrupts even more
unlikely to happen as well. While here, reinit SCR to SDBS because this
bit should always be set according to documentation. There is no effect,
though, because the interface is disabled.

tools build feature: Use CC and CXX from parent
[ Upstream commit e3232c2f39acafd5a29128425bc30b9884642cfa ]
commit c8c188679ccf ("tools build: Use the same CC for feature detection
and actual build") changed these assignments from unconditional (:=) to
conditional (?=) so that they wouldn't clobber values from the
environment. However, conditional assignment does not work properly for
variables that Make implicitly sets, among which are CC and CXX. To
quote tools/scripts/Makefile.include, which handles this properly:
# Makefiles suck: This macro sets a default value of $(2) for the
# variable named by $(1), unless the variable has been set by
# environment or command line. This is necessary for CC and AR
# because make sets default values, so the simpler ?= approach
# won't work as expected.
In other words, the conditional assignments will not run even if the
variables are not overridden in the environment; Make will set CC to
"cc" and CXX to "g++" when it starts[1], meaning the variables are not
empty by the time the conditional assignments are evaluated. This breaks
cross-compilation when CROSS\_COMPILE is set but CC isn't, since "cc"
gets used for feature detection instead of the cross compiler (and
likewise for CXX).
To fix the issue, just pass down the values of CC and CXX computed by
the parent Makefile, which gets included by the Makefile that actually
builds whatever we're detecting features for and so is guaranteed to
have good values. This is a better solution anyway, since it means we
aren't trying to replicate the logic of the parent build system and so
don't risk it getting out of sync.
Leave PKG\_CONFIG alone, since 1) there's no common logic to compute it
in Makefile.include, and 2) it's not an implicit variable, so
conditional assignment works properly.

dm\_stop\_queue() only uses blk\_mq\_quiesce\_queue() so it doesn't
formally stop the blk-mq queue; therefore there is no point making the
blk\_mq\_queue\_stopped() check -- it will never be stopped.
In addition, even though dm\_stop\_queue() actually tries to quiesce hw
queues via blk\_mq\_quiesce\_queue(), checking with blk\_queue\_quiesced()
to avoid unnecessary queue quiesce isn't reliable because: the
QUEUE\_FLAG\_QUIESCED flag is set before synchronize\_rcu() and
dm\_stop\_queue() may be called when synchronize\_rcu() from another
blk\_mq\_quiesce\_queue() is in-progress.

watchdog: f71808e\_wdt: clear watchdog timeout occurred flag
commit 4f39d575844148fbf3081571a1f3b4ae04150958 upstream.
The flag indicating a watchdog timeout having occurred normally persists
till Power-On Reset of the Fintek Super I/O chip. The user can clear it
by writing a `1' to the bit.
The driver doesn't offer a restart method, so regular system reboot
might not reset the Super I/O and if the watchdog isn't enabled, we
won't touch the register containing the bit on the next boot.
In this case all subsequent regular reboots will be wrongly flagged
by the driver as being caused by the watchdog.
Fix this by having the flag cleared after read. This is also done by
other drivers like those for the i6300esb and mpc8xxx\_wdt.

watchdog: f71808e\_wdt: remove use of wrong watchdog\_info option
commit 802141462d844f2e6a4d63a12260d79b7afc4c34 upstream.
The flags that should be or-ed into the watchdog\_info.options by drivers
all start with WDIOF\_, e.g. WDIOF\_SETTIMEOUT, which indicates that the
driver's watchdog\_ops has a usable set\_timeout.
WDIOC\_SETTIMEOUT was used instead, which expands to 0xc0045706, which
equals:
WDIOF\_FANFAULT | WDIOF\_EXTERN1 | WDIOF\_PRETIMEOUT | WDIOF\_ALARMONLY |
WDIOF\_MAGICCLOSE | 0xc0045000
These were so far indicated to userspace on WDIOC\_GETSUPPORT.
As the driver has not yet been migrated to the new watchdog kernel API,
the constant can just be dropped without substitute.

tracing: Use trace\_sched\_process\_free() instead of exit() for pid tracing
commit afcab636657421f7ebfa0783a91f90256bba0091 upstream.
On exit, if a process is preempted after the trace\_sched\_process\_exit()
tracepoint but before the process is done exiting, then when it gets
scheduled in, the function tracers will not filter it properly against the
function tracing pid filters.
That is because the function tracing pid filters hooks to the
sched\_process\_exit() tracepoint to remove the exiting task's pid from the
filter list. Because the filtering happens at the sched\_switch tracepoint,
when the exiting task schedules back in to finish up the exit, it will no
longer be in the function pid filtering tables.
This was noticeable in the notrace self tests on a preemptable kernel, as
the tests would fail as it exits and preempted after being taken off the
notrace filter table and on scheduling back in it would not be in the
notrace list, and then the ending of the exit function would trace. The test
detected this and would fail.

Call Trace:
ftrace\_ops\_assist\_func+0x56/0xe0
ftrace\_call+0x5/0x34
tcpa\_statistic\_send+0x5/0x130 [ttcp\_engine]
The tcpa\_statistic\_send is the function being kprobed. After analysis,
the root cause is that the fourth parameter regs of kprobe\_ftrace\_handler
is NULL. Why regs is NULL? We use the crash tool to analyze the kdump.
crash> dis tcpa\_statistic\_send -r
: callq 0xffffffffbd8018c0
The tcpa\_statistic\_send calls ftrace\_caller instead of ftrace\_regs\_caller.
So it is reasonable that the fourth parameter regs of kprobe\_ftrace\_handler
is NULL. In theory, we should call the ftrace\_regs\_caller instead of the
ftrace\_caller. After in-depth analysis, we found a reproducible path.
Writing a simple kernel module which starts a periodic timer. The
timer's handler is named 'kprobe\_test\_timer\_handler'. The module
name is kprobe\_test.ko.
1) insmod kprobe\_test.ko
2) bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:kprobe\_test\_timer\_handler {}'
3) echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
4) rmmod kprobe\_test
5) stop step 2) kprobe
6) insmod kprobe\_test.ko
7) bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:kprobe\_test\_timer\_handler {}'
We mark the kprobe as GONE but not disarm the kprobe in the step 4).
The step 5) also do not disarm the kprobe when unregister kprobe. So
we do not remove the ip from the filter. In this case, when the module
loads again in the step 6), we will replace the code to ftrace\_caller
via the ftrace\_module\_enable(). When we register kprobe again, we will
not replace ftrace\_caller to ftrace\_regs\_caller because the ftrace is
disabled in the step 3). So the step 7) will trigger kernel panic. Fix
this problem by disarming the kprobe when the module is going away.

ftrace: Setup correct FTRACE\_FL\_REGS flags for module
commit 8a224ffb3f52b0027f6b7279854c71a31c48fc97 upstream.
When module loaded and enabled, we will use \_\_ftrace\_replace\_code
for module if any ftrace\_ops referenced it found. But we will get
wrong ftrace\_addr for module rec in ftrace\_get\_addr\_new, because
rec->flags has not been setup correctly. It can cause the callback
function of a ftrace\_ops has FTRACE\_OPS\_FL\_SAVE\_REGS to be called
with pt\_regs set to NULL.
So setup correct FTRACE\_FL\_REGS flags for rec when we call
referenced\_filters to find ftrace\_ops references it.

Note that sbi->s\_freeinodes\_counter is only used in the algorithm that

and they are used as bio bv\_page for I/Os to the cache device. for
example cache\_set->uuids, cache->disk\_buckets, journal\_write->data,

For such meta data memory, all the allocated pages should be treated
as a single memory block. Then the memory management and underlying I/O

This patch adds \_\_GFP\_COMP flag to all the location allocating >0 order

In degraded raid5, we need to read parity to do reconstruct-write when
data disks fail. However, we can not read parity from
handle\_stripe\_dirtying() in force reconstruct-write mode.
Reproducible Steps:
1. Create degraded raid5
mdadm -C /dev/md2 --assume-clean -l5 -n3 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 missing
2. Set rmw\_level to 0
echo 0 > /sys/block/md2/md/rmw\_level
3. IO to raid5
Now some io may be stuck in raid5. We can use handle\_stripe\_fill() to read
the parity in this situation.

commit df43dd526e6609769ae513a81443c7aa727c8ca3 upstream.
The IPQ806x does not appear to have a functional multicast ethernet
address filter. This was observed as a failure to correctly receive IPv6
packets on a LAN to the all stations address. Checking the vendor driver
shows that it does not attempt to enable the multicast filter and
instead falls back to receiving all multicast packets, internally
setting ALLMULTI.
Use the new fallback support in the dwmac1000 driver to correctly
achieve the same with the mainline IPQ806x driver. Confirmed to fix IPv6

powerpc: Fix circular dependency between percpu.h and mmu.h
commit 0c83b277ada72b585e6a3e52b067669df15bcedb upstream.
Recently random.h started including percpu.h (see commit
f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt and
activity")), which broke corenet64\_smp\_defconfig:
In file included from /linux/arch/powerpc/include/asm/paca.h:18,

139 | DECLARE\_PER\_CPU(int, next\_tlbcam\_idx);
This is due to a circular header dependency:
asm/mmu.h includes asm/percpu.h, which includes asm/paca.h, which
includes asm/mmu.h
Which means DECLARE\_PER\_CPU() isn't defined when mmu.h needs it.
We can fix it by moving the include of paca.h below the include of
asm-generic/percpu.h.
This moves the include of paca.h out of the #ifdef \_\_powerpc64\_\_, but
that is OK because paca.h is almost entirely inside #ifdef
CONFIG\_PPC64 anyway.
It also moves the include of paca.h out of the #ifdef CONFIG\_SMP,
which could possibly break something, but seems to have no ill
effects.

btrfs: fix memory leaks after failure to lookup checksums during inode logging
commit 4f26433e9b3eb7a55ed70d8f882ae9cd48ba448b upstream.
While logging an inode, at copy\_items(), if we fail to lookup the checksums
for an extent we release the destination path, free the ins\_data array and
then return immediately. However a previous iteration of the for loop may
have added checksums to the ordered\_sums list, in which case we leak the
memory used by them.
So fix this by making sure we iterate the ordered\_sums list and free all
its checksums before returning.

btrfs: only search for left\_info if there is no right\_info in try\_merge\_free\_space
commit bf53d4687b8f3f6b752f091eb85f62369a515dfd upstream.
In try\_to\_merge\_free\_space we attempt to find entries to the left and
right of the entry we are adding to see if they can be merged. We
search for an entry past our current info (saved into right\_info), and
then if right\_info exists and it has a rb\_prev() we save the rb\_prev()
into left\_info.
However there's a slight problem in the case that we have a right\_info,
but no entry previous to that entry. At that point we will search for
an entry just before the info we're attempting to insert. This will
simply find right\_info again, and assign it to left\_info, making them
both the same pointer.
Now if right\_info \_can\_ be merged with the range we're inserting, we'll
add it to the info and free right\_info. However further down we'll
access left\_info, which was right\_info, and thus get a use-after-free.
Fix this by only searching for the left entry if we don't find a right
entry at all.
The CVE referenced had a specially crafted file system that could
trigger this use-after-free. However with the tree checker improvements
we no longer trigger the conditions for the UAF. But the original
conditions still apply, hence this fix.

btrfs: don't allocate anonymous block device for user invisible roots
commit 851fd730a743e072badaf67caf39883e32439431 upstream.

When a lot of subvolumes are created, there is a user report about
transaction aborted:

BTRFS warning (device sda1): Skipping commit of aborted transaction.
BTRFS: error (device sda1) in cleanup\_transaction:1831: errno=-24 unknown
[CAUSE]
The error is EMFILE (Too many files open) and comes from the anonymous
block device allocation. The ids are in a shared pool of size 1<<20.
The ids are assigned to live subvolumes, ie. the root structure exists
in memory (eg. after creation or after the root appears in some path).
The pool could be exhausted if the numbers are not reclaimed fast
enough, after subvolume deletion or if other system component uses the
anon block devices.
[WORKAROUND]
Since it's not possible to completely solve the problem, we can only
minimize the time the id is allocated to a subvolume root.
Firstly, we can reduce the use of anon\_dev by trees that are not
subvolume roots, like data reloc tree.
This patch will do extra check on root objectid, to skip roots that
don't need anon\_dev. Currently it's only data reloc tree and orphan
roots.

net: initialize fastreuse on inet\_inherit\_port
commit d76f3351cea2d927fdf70dd7c06898235035e84e upstream.
In the case of TPROXY, bind\_conflict optimizations for SO\_REUSEADDR or
SO\_REUSEPORT are broken, possibly resulting in O(n) instead of O(1) bind
behaviour or in the incorrect reuse of a bind.
the kernel keeps track for each bind\_bucket if all sockets in the
bind\_bucket support SO\_REUSEADDR or SO\_REUSEPORT in two fastreuse flags.
These flags allow skipping the costly bind\_conflict check when possible
(meaning when all sockets have the proper SO\_REUSE option).
For every socket added to a bind\_bucket, these flags need to be updated.
As soon as a socket that does not support reuse is added, the flag is
set to false and will never go back to true, unless the bind\_bucket is
deleted.
Note that there is no mechanism to re-evaluate these flags when a socket
is removed (this might make sense when removing a socket that would not
allow reuse; this leaves room for a future patch).
For this optimization to work, it is mandatory that these flags are
properly initialized and updated.
When a child socket is created from a listen socket in
\_\_inet\_inherit\_port, the TPROXY case could create a new bind bucket
without properly initializing these flags, thus preventing the
optimization to work. Alternatively, a socket not allowing reuse could
be added to an existing bind bucket without updating the flags, causing
bind\_conflict to never be called as it should.
Call inet\_csk\_update\_fastreuse when \_\_inet\_inherit\_port decides to create
a new bind\_bucket or use a different bind\_bucket than the one of the
listen socket.

Commit 711419e504eb ("irqdomain: Add the missing assignment of
domain->fwnode for named fwnode") unintentionally caused a dangling pointer
page fault issue on firmware nodes that were freed after IRQ domain
allocation. Commit e3beca48a45b fixed that dangling pointer issue by only
freeing the firmware node after an IRQ domain allocation failure. That fix
no longer frees the firmware node immediately, but leaves the firmware node
allocated after the domain is removed.
The firmware node must be kept around through irq\_domain\_remove, but should be
freed it afterwards.
Add the missing free operations after domain removal where where appropriate.

ALSA: usb-audio: work around streaming quirk for MacroSilicon MS2109
commit 1b7ecc241a67ad6b584e071bd791a54e0cd5f097 upstream.
Further investigation of the L-R swap problem on the MS2109 reveals that
the problem isn't that the channels are swapped, but rather that they
are swapped and also out of phase by one sample. In other words, the
issue is actually that the very first frame that comes from the hardware
is a half-frame containing only the right channel, and after that
everything becomes offset.
So introduce a new quirk field to drop the very first 2 bytes that come
in after the format is configured and a capture stream starts. This puts
the channels in phase and in the correct order.

fs/minix: reject too-large maximum file size
commit 270ef41094e9fa95273f288d7d785313ceab2ff3 upstream.
If the minix filesystem tries to map a very large logical block number to
its on-disk location, block\_to\_path() can return offsets that are too
large, causing out-of-bounds memory accesses when accessing indirect index
blocks. This should be prevented by the check against the maximum file
size, but this doesn't work because the maximum file size is read directly
from the on-disk superblock and isn't validated itself.
Fix this by validating the maximum file size at mount time.

KASAN: use-after-free Read in get\_block
WARNING in inc\_nlink

This patch (of 6):
sb\_getblk() can fail, so check its return value.
This fixes a NULL pointer dereference.

FIELD\_FIT() should return true or false at runtime for whether a value

crypto: ccp - Fix use of merged scatterlists
commit 8a302808c60d441d9884cb00ea7f2b534f2e3ca5 upstream.
Running the crypto manager self tests with
CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_MANAGER\_EXTRA\_TESTS may result in several types of errors
when using the ccp-crypto driver:
alg: skcipher: cbc-des3-ccp encryption failed on test vector 0; expected\_error=0, actual\_error=-5 ...
alg: skcipher: ctr-aes-ccp decryption overran dst buffer on test vector 0 ...
alg: ahash: sha224-ccp test failed (wrong result) on test vector ...
These errors are the result of improper processing of scatterlists mapped
for DMA.
Given a scatterlist in which entries are merged as part of mapping the
scatterlist for DMA, the DMA length of a merged entry will reflect the
combined length of the entries that were merged. The subsequent
scatterlist entry will contain DMA information for the scatterlist entry
after the last merged entry, but the non-DMA information will be that of
the first merged entry.
The ccp driver does not take this scatterlist merging into account. To
address this, add a second scatterlist pointer to track the current
position in the DMA mapped representation of the scatterlist. Both the DMA
representation and the original representation of the scatterlist must be
tracked as while most of the driver can use just the DMA representation,
scatterlist\_map\_and\_copy() must use the original representation and
expects the scatterlist pointer to be accurate to the original
representation.
In order to properly walk the original scatterlist, the scatterlist must
be walked until the combined lengths of the entries seen is equal to the
DMA length of the current entry being processed in the DMA mapped
representation.

crypto: qat - fix double free in qat\_uclo\_create\_batch\_init\_list
commit c06c76602e03bde24ee69a2022a829127e504202 upstream.
clang static analysis flags this error
qat\_uclo.c:297:3: warning: Attempt to free released memory
[unix.Malloc]
kfree(\*init\_tab\_base);
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When input \*init\_tab\_base is null, the function allocates memory for
the head of the list. When there is problem allocating other list
elements the list is unwound and freed. Then a check is made if the
list head was allocated and is also freed.
Keeping track of the what may need to be freed is the variable 'tail\_old'.
The unwinding/freeing block is
while (tail\_old) {
mem\_init = tail\_old->next;
kfree(tail\_old);
tail\_old = mem\_init;
}
The problem is that the first element of tail\_old is also what was
allocated for the list head
init\_header = kzalloc(sizeof(\*init\_header), GFP\_KERNEL);
...
\*init\_tab\_base = init\_header;
flag = 1;
}
tail\_old = init\_header;
So \*init\_tab\_base/init\_header are freed twice.
There is another problem.
When the input \*init\_tab\_base is non null the tail\_old is calculated by
traveling down the list to first non null entry.
tail\_old = init\_header;
while (tail\_old->next)
tail\_old = tail\_old->next;
When the unwinding free happens, the last entry of the input list will
be freed.
So the freeing needs a general changed.
If locally allocated the first element of tail\_old is freed, else it
is skipped. As a bit of cleanup, reset \*init\_tab\_base if it came in
as null.

drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Added needed\_headroom and a skb->len check
[ Upstream commit c7ca03c216acb14466a713fedf1b9f2c24994ef2 ]
1. Added a skb->len check
This driver expects upper layers to include a pseudo header of 1 byte
when passing down a skb for transmission. This driver will read this
1-byte header. This patch added a skb->len check before reading the
header to make sure the header exists.
2. Changed to use needed\_headroom instead of hard\_header\_len to request
necessary headroom to be allocated
In net/packet/af\_packet.c, the function packet\_snd first reserves a
headroom of length (dev->hard\_header\_len + dev->needed\_headroom).
Then if the socket is a SOCK\_DGRAM socket, it calls dev\_hard\_header,
which calls dev->header\_ops->create, to create the link layer header.
If the socket is a SOCK\_RAW socket, it "un-reserves" a headroom of
length (dev->hard\_header\_len), and assumes the user to provide the
appropriate link layer header.
So according to the logic of af\_packet.c, dev->hard\_header\_len should
be the length of the header that would be created by
dev->header\_ops->create.
However, this driver doesn't provide dev->header\_ops, so logically
dev->hard\_header\_len should be 0.
So we should use dev->needed\_headroom instead of dev->hard\_header\_len
to request necessary headroom to be allocated.
This change fixes kernel panic when this driver is used with AF\_PACKET
SOCK\_RAW sockets.

af\_packet: TPACKET\_V3: fix fill status rwlock imbalance
[ Upstream commit 88fd1cb80daa20af063bce81e1fad14e945a8dc4 ]
After @blk\_fill\_in\_prog\_lock is acquired there is an early out vnet
situation that can occur. In that case, the rwlock needs to be
released.
Also, since @blk\_fill\_in\_prog\_lock is only acquired when @tp\_version
is exactly TPACKET\_V3, only release it on that exact condition as
well.
And finally, add sparse annotation so that it is clearer that
prb\_fill\_curr\_block() and prb\_clear\_blk\_fill\_status() are acquiring
and releasing @blk\_fill\_in\_prog\_lock, respectively. sparse is still
unable to understand the balance, but the warnings are now on a
higher level that make more sense.

pinctrl-single: fix pcs\_parse\_pinconf() return value
[ Upstream commit f46fe79ff1b65692a65266a5bec6dbe2bf7fc70f ]
This patch causes pcs\_parse\_pinconf() to return -ENOTSUPP when no
pinctrl\_map is added. The current behavior is to return 0 when
!PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF or !nconfs. Thus pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry()
incorrectly assumes that a map was added and sets num\_maps = 2.
Analysis:
=========
The function pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() calls pcs\_parse\_pinconf()
if PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF is enabled. The function pcs\_parse\_pinconf()
returns 0 to indicate there was no error and num\_maps is then set to 2:
980 static int pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry(struct pcs\_device \*pcs,
981 struct device\_node \*np,
982 struct pinctrl\_map \*\*map,
983 unsigned \*num\_maps,
984 const char \*\*pgnames)
985 {
1053 (\*map)->type = PIN\_MAP\_TYPE\_MUX\_GROUP;
1054 (\*map)->data.mux.group = np->name;
1055 (\*map)->data.mux.function = np->name;
1056
1057 if (PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF && function) {
1058 res = pcs\_parse\_pinconf(pcs, np, function, map);
1059 if (res)
1060 goto free\_pingroups;
1061 \*num\_maps = 2;
1062 } else {
1063 \*num\_maps = 1;
1064 }
However, pcs\_parse\_pinconf() will also return 0 if !PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF or
!nconfs. I believe these conditions should indicate that no map was
added by returning -ENOTSUPP. Otherwise pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry()
will set num\_maps = 2 even though no maps were successfully added, as
it does not reach "m++" on line 940:
895 static int pcs\_parse\_pinconf(struct pcs\_device \*pcs, struct device\_node \*np,
896 struct pcs\_function \*func,
897 struct pinctrl\_map \*\*map)
898
899 {
900 struct pinctrl\_map \*m = \*map;
917 /\* If pinconf isn't supported, don't parse properties in below. \*/
918 if (!PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF)
919 return 0;
920
921 /\* cacluate how much properties are supported in current node \*/
922 for (i = 0; i < ARRAY\_SIZE(prop2); i++) {
923 if (of\_find\_property(np, prop2[i].name, NULL))
924 nconfs++;
925 }
926 for (i = 0; i < ARRAY\_SIZE(prop4); i++) {
927 if (of\_find\_property(np, prop4[i].name, NULL))
928 nconfs++;
929 }
930 if (!nconfs)
919 return 0;
932
933 func->conf = devm\_kcalloc(pcs->dev,
934 nconfs, sizeof(struct pcs\_conf\_vals),
935 GFP\_KERNEL);
936 if (!func->conf)
937 return -ENOMEM;
938 func->nconfs = nconfs;
939 conf = &(func->conf[0]);
940 m++;
This situtation will cause a boot failure [0] on the BeagleBone Black
(AM3358) when am33xx\_pinmux node in arch/arm/boot/dts/am33xx-l4.dtsi
has compatible = "pinconf-single" instead of "pinctrl-single".
The patch fixes this issue by returning -ENOSUPP when !PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF
or !nconfs, so that pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() will know that no
map was added.
Logic is also added to pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() to distinguish
between -ENOSUPP and other errors. In the case of -ENOSUPP, num\_maps
is set to 1 as it is valid for pinconf to be enabled and a given pin
group to not any pinconf properties.

dlm: Fix kobject memleak
[ Upstream commit 0ffddafc3a3970ef7013696e7f36b3d378bc4c16 ]
Currently the error return path from kobject\_init\_and\_add() is not
followed by a call to kobject\_put() - which means we are leaking
the kobject.
Set do\_unreg = 1 before kobject\_init\_and\_add() to ensure that
kobject\_put() can be called in its error patch.

tools, build: Propagate build failures from tools/build/Makefile.build
[ Upstream commit a278f3d8191228212c553a5d4303fa603214b717 ]
The '&&' command seems to have a bad effect when $(cmd\_$(1)) exits with
non-zero effect: the command failure is masked (despite `set -e`) and all but
the first command of $(dep-cmd) is executed (successfully, as they are mostly
printfs), thus overall returning 0 in the end.
This means in practice that despite compilation errors, tools's build Makefile
will return success. We see this very reliably with libbpf's Makefile, which
doesn't get compilation error propagated properly. This in turns causes issues
with selftests build, as well as bpftool and other projects that rely on
building libbpf.
The fix is simple: don't use &&. Given `set -e`, we don't need to chain
commands with &&. The shell will exit on first failure, giving desired
behavior and propagating error properly.

In theory, a panic can happen after a bus or host reset with dma\_started
flag set. Fix this by halting the DMA before reinitializing the host.
Don't assume that ms->current\_req is set when halt\_dma() is invoked as it
may not hold for bus or host reset.
BTW, this particular Conner drive can be made to work by inhibiting
disconnect/reselect with 'mesh.resel\_targets=0'.

usb: dwc2: Fix error path in gadget registration

there is no need to disable low-level hardware, so return immiedetly

This fixes the following kernel NULL ptr dereference on gadget failure

parameters):

While fixing this also fix the double call to dwc2\_lowlevel\_hw\_disable()
if dr\_mode is set to USB\_DR\_MODE\_PERIPHERAL. In such case low-level
hardware is already disabled before calling usb\_add\_gadget\_udc(). That
function correctly preserves low-level hardware state, there is no need
for the second unconditional dwc2\_lowlevel\_hw\_disable() call.

USB: serial: iuu\_phoenix: fix led-activity helpers
[ Upstream commit de37458f8c2bfc465500a1dd0d15dbe96d2a698c ]
The set-led command is eight bytes long and starts with a command byte
followed by six bytes of RGB data and ends with a byte encoding a
frequency (see iuu\_led() and iuu\_rgbf\_fill\_buffer()).
The led activity helpers had a few long-standing bugs which corrupted
the command packets by inserting a second command byte and thereby
offsetting the RGB data and dropping the frequency in non-xmas mode.
In xmas mode, a related off-by-one error left the frequency field
uninitialised.

The code in vdso\_cpu\_init that exposes the cpu and numa node to
userspace via SPRG\_VDSO incorrctly masks the cpu to 12 bits. This means
that any kernel running on a box with more than 4096 threads (NR\_CPUS
advertises a limit of of 8192 cpus) would expose userspace to two cpu
contexts running at the same time with the same cpu number.
Note: I'm not aware of any distro shipping a kernel with support for more
than 4096 threads today, nor of any system image that currently exceeds
4096 threads. Found via code browsing.

PCI: Fix pci\_cfg\_wait queue locking problem
[ Upstream commit 2a7e32d0547f41c5ce244f84cf5d6ca7fccee7eb ]
The pci\_cfg\_wait queue is used to prevent user-space config accesses to
devices while they are recovering from reset.
Previously we used these operations on pci\_cfg\_wait:
\_\_add\_wait\_queue(&pci\_cfg\_wait, ...)
\_\_remove\_wait\_queue(&pci\_cfg\_wait, ...)
wake\_up\_all(&pci\_cfg\_wait)
The wake\_up acquires the wait queue lock, but the add and remove do not.
Originally these were all protected by the pci\_lock, but cdcb33f98244
("PCI: Avoid possible deadlock on pci\_lock and p->pi\_lock"), moved
wake\_up\_all() outside pci\_lock, so it could race with add/remove
operations, which caused occasional kernel panics, e.g., during vfio-pci
hotplug/unplug testing:
Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address ffff802dac469000
Resolve this by using wait\_event() instead of \_\_add\_wait\_queue() and
\_\_remove\_wait\_queue(). The wait queue lock is held by both wait\_event()
and wake\_up\_all(), so it provides mutual exclusion.

media: firewire: Using uninitialized values in node\_probe()
[ Upstream commit 2505a210fc126599013aec2be741df20aaacc490 ]
If fw\_csr\_string() returns -ENOENT, then "name" is uninitialized. So
then the "strlen(model\_names[i]) <= name\_len" is true because strlen()
is unsigned and -ENOENT is type promoted to a very high positive value.
Then the "strncmp(name, model\_names[i], name\_len)" uses uninitialized
data because "name" is uninitialized.

ipvs: allow connection reuse for unconfirmed conntrack
[ Upstream commit f0a5e4d7a594e0fe237d3dfafb069bb82f80f42f ]
YangYuxi is reporting that connection reuse
is causing one-second delay when SYN hits
existing connection in TIME\_WAIT state.
Such delay was added to give time to expire
both the IPVS connection and the corresponding
conntrack. This was considered a rare case
at that time but it is causing problem for
some environments such as Kubernetes.
As nf\_conntrack\_tcp\_packet() can decide to
release the conntrack in TIME\_WAIT state and
to replace it with a fresh NEW conntrack, we
can use this to allow rescheduling just by
tuning our check: if the conntrack is
confirmed we can not schedule it to different
real server and the one-second delay still
applies but if new conntrack was created,
we are free to select new real server without
any delays.
YangYuxi lists some of the problem reports:
- One second connection delay in masquerading mode:

- IPVS low throughput #70747

- Apache Bench can fill up ipvs service proxy in seconds #544

ACPICA: Do not increment operation\_region reference counts for field units
[ Upstream commit 6a54ebae6d047c988a31f5ac5a64ab5cf83797a2 ]
ACPICA commit e17b28cfcc31918d0db9547b6b274b09c413eb70
Object reference counts are used as a part of ACPICA's garbage
collection mechanism. This mechanism keeps track of references to
heap-allocated structures such as the ACPI operand objects.
Recent server firmware has revealed that this reference count can
overflow on large servers that declare many field units under the
same operation\_region. This occurs because each field unit declaration
will add a reference count to the source operation\_region.
This change solves the reference count overflow for operation\_regions
objects by preventing fieldunits from incrementing their
operation\_region's reference count. Each operation\_region's reference
count will not be changed by named objects declared under the Field
operator. During namespace deletion, the operation\_region namespace
node will be deleted and each fieldunit will be deleted without
touching the deleted operation\_region object.

bcache: fix super block seq numbers comparision in register\_cache\_set()
[ Upstream commit 117f636ea695270fe492d0c0c9dfadc7a662af47 ]
In register\_cache\_set(), c is pointer to struct cache\_set, and ca is
pointer to struct cache, if ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq, it means this
registering cache has up to date version and other members, the in-
memory version and other members should be updated to the newer value.
But current implementation makes a cache set only has a single cache
device, so the above assumption works well except for a special case.
The execption is when a cache device new created and both ca->sb.seq and
c->sb.seq are 0, because the super block is never flushed out yet. In
the location for the following if() check,
2156 if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq) {
2157 c->sb.version = ca->sb.version;
2158 memcpy(c->sb.set\_uuid, ca->sb.set\_uuid, 16);
2159 c->sb.flags = ca->sb.flags;
2160 c->sb.seq = ca->sb.seq;
2161 pr\_debug("set version = %llu\n", c->sb.version);
2162 }
c->sb.version is not initialized yet and valued 0. When ca->sb.seq is 0,
the if() check will fail (because both values are 0), and the cache set
version, set\_uuid, flags and seq won't be updated.
The above problem is hiden for current code, because the bucket size is
compatible among different super block version. And the next time when
running cache set again, ca->sb.seq will be larger than 0 and cache set
super block version will be updated properly.
But if the large bucket feature is enabled, sb->bucket\_size is the low
16bits of the bucket size. For a power of 2 value, when the actual
bucket size exceeds 16bit width, sb->bucket\_size will always be 0. Then
read\_super\_common() will fail because the if() check to
is\_power\_of\_2(sb->bucket\_size) is false. This is how the long time
hidden bug is triggered.
This patch modifies the if() check to the following way,
2156 if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq || c->sb.seq == 0) {
Then cache set's version, set\_uuid, flags and seq will always be updated
corectly including for a new created cache device.

ddebug\_describe\_flags() currently fills a caller provided string buffer,

replacing them with a known-big-enough string buffer wrapped in a

Also simplify ddebug\_describe\_flags() flags parameter from a struct to

This makes the function reusable (soon) where flags are unpacked.

gpu: host1x: debug: Fix multiple channels emitting messages simultaneously
[ Upstream commit 35681862808472a0a4b9a8817ae2789c0b5b3edc ]
Once channel's job is hung, it dumps the channel's state into KMSG before
tearing down the offending job. If multiple channels hang at once, then
they dump messages simultaneously, making the debug info unreadable, and
thus, useless. This patch adds mutex which allows only one channel to emit
debug messages at a time.

iwlegacy: Check the return value of pcie\_capability\_read\_\*()
[ Upstream commit 9018fd7f2a73e9b290f48a56b421558fa31e8b75 ]
On failure pcie\_capability\_read\_dword() sets it's last parameter, val
to 0. However, with Patch 14/14, it is possible that val is set to ~0 on
failure. This would introduce a bug because (x & x) == (~0 & x).
This bug can be avoided without changing the function's behaviour if the
return value of pcie\_capability\_read\_dword is checked to confirm success.
Check the return value of pcie\_capability\_read\_dword() to ensure success.

brcmfmac: set state of hanger slot to FREE when flushing PSQ
[ Upstream commit fcdd7a875def793c38d7369633af3eba6c7cf089 ]
When USB or SDIO device got abnormal bus disconnection, host driver
tried to clean up the skbs in PSQ and TXQ (The skb's pointer in hanger
slot linked to PSQ and TSQ), so we should set the state of skb hanger slot
to BRCMF\_FWS\_HANGER\_ITEM\_STATE\_FREE before freeing skb.
In brcmf\_fws\_bus\_txq\_cleanup it already sets
BRCMF\_FWS\_HANGER\_ITEM\_STATE\_FREE before freeing skb, therefore we add the
same thing in brcmf\_fws\_psq\_flush to avoid following warning message.

[ Upstream commit edcb3895a751c762a18d25c8d9846ce9759ed7e1 ]
neofb\_probe() calls neo\_scan\_monitor() that can successfully allocate a
memory for info->monspecs.modedb and proceed to case 0x03. There it does
not free the memory and returns -1. neofb\_probe() goes to label
err\_scan\_monitor, thus, it does not free this memory through calling
fb\_destroy\_modedb() as well. We can not go to label err\_init\_hw since
neo\_scan\_monitor() can fail during memory allocation. So, the patch frees
the memory directly for case 0x03.

When writing values to the IOP status/control register make sure those
values do not have any extraneous bits that will clear interrupt flags.
To place the SCC IOP into bypass mode would be desirable but this is not
achieved by writing IOP\_DMAINACTIVE | IOP\_RUN | IOP\_AUTOINC | IOP\_BYPASS
to the control register. Drop this ineffective register write.

[ Upstream commit aeb445bf2194d83e12e85bf5c65baaf1f093bd8f ]
In the following sequence of calls, iop\_do\_send() gets called when the

iop\_ism\_irq()
iop\_handle\_send()

iop\_do\_send()
Avoid this by testing the channel state before calling iop\_do\_send().
When sending, and iop\_send\_queue is empty, call iop\_do\_send() because
the channel is idle. If iop\_send\_queue is not empty, iop\_do\_send() will
get called later by iop\_handle\_send().

msm8916-pins.dtsi specifies "bias-pull-none" for most of the audio
pin configurations. This was likely copied from the qcom kernel fork
where the same property was used for these audio pins.
However, "bias-pull-none" actually does not exist at all - not in
mainline and not in downstream. I can only guess that the original
intention was to configure "no pull", i.e. bias-disable.
Change it to that instead.

When kobject\_init\_and\_add() returns an error, it should be handled
because kobject\_init\_and\_add() takes a reference even when it fails. If
this function returns an error, kobject\_put() must be called to properly

Therefore, replace calling kfree() and call kobject\_put() and add a
missing kobject\_put() in the edac\_device\_register\_sysfs\_main\_kobj()

HID: input: Fix devices that return multiple bytes in battery report
commit 4f57cace81438cc873a96f9f13f08298815c9b51 upstream.
Some devices, particularly the 3DConnexion Spacemouse wireless 3D
controllers, return more than just the battery capacity in the battery
report. The Spacemouse devices return an additional byte with a device
specific field. However, hidinput\_query\_battery\_capacity() only
requests a 2 byte transfer.
When a spacemouse is connected via USB (direct wire, no wireless dongle)
and it returns a 3 byte report instead of the assumed 2 byte battery
report the larger transfer confuses and frightens the USB subsystem
which chooses to ignore the transfer. Then after 2 seconds assume the
device has stopped responding and reset it. This can be reproduced
easily by using a wired connection with a wireless spacemouse. The
Spacemouse will enter a loop of resetting every 2 seconds which can be
observed in dmesg.
This patch solves the problem by increasing the transfer request to 4
bytes instead of 2. The fix isn't particularly elegant, but it is simple
and safe to backport to stable kernels. A further patch will follow to
more elegantly handle battery reports that contain additional data.

tracepoint: Mark \_\_tracepoint\_string's \_\_used
commit f3751ad0116fb6881f2c3c957d66a9327f69cefb upstream.
\_\_tracepoint\_string's have their string data stored in .rodata, and an
address to that data stored in the "\_\_tracepoint\_str" section. Functions
that refer to those strings refer to the symbol of the address. Compiler
optimization can replace those address references with references
directly to the string data. If the address doesn't appear to have other
uses, then it appears dead to the compiler and is removed. This can
break the /tracing/printk\_formats sysfs node which iterates the
addresses stored in the "\_\_tracepoint\_str" section.
Like other strings stored in custom sections in this header, mark these
\_\_used to inform the compiler that there are other non-obvious users of
the address, so they should still be emitted.

smk\_write\_relabel\_self() frees memory from the task's credentials with
no locking, which can easily cause a use-after-free because multiple
tasks can share the same credentials structure.
Fix this by using prepare\_creds() and commit\_creds() to correctly modify
the task's credentials.

rxrpc: Fix race between recvmsg and sendmsg on immediate call failure
[ Upstream commit 65550098c1c4db528400c73acf3e46bfa78d9264 ]
There's a race between rxrpc\_sendmsg setting up a call, but then failing to
send anything on it due to an error, and recvmsg() seeing the call
completion occur and trying to return the state to the user.
An assertion fails in rxrpc\_recvmsg() because the call has already been
released from the socket and is about to be released again as recvmsg deals
with it. (The recvmsg\_q queue on the socket holds a ref, so there's no
problem with use-after-free.)
We also have to be careful not to end up reporting an error twice, in such
a way that both returns indicate to userspace that the user ID supplied
with the call is no longer in use - which could cause the client to
malfunction if it recycles the user ID fast enough.
Fix this by the following means:
(1) When sendmsg() creates a call after the point that the call has been
successfully added to the socket, don't return any errors through
sendmsg(), but rather complete the call and let recvmsg() retrieve
them. Make sendmsg() return 0 at this point. Further calls to
sendmsg() for that call will fail with ESHUTDOWN.
Note that at this point, we haven't send any packets yet, so the
server doesn't yet know about the call.
(2) If sendmsg() returns an error when it was expected to create a new
call, it means that the user ID wasn't used.
(3) Mark the call disconnected before marking it completed to prevent an
oops in rxrpc\_release\_call().
(4) recvmsg() will then retrieve the error and set MSG\_EOR to indicate
that the user ID is no longer known by the kernel.
An oops like the following is produced:

selftests/net: relax cpu affinity requirement in msg\_zerocopy test
[ Upstream commit 16f6458f2478b55e2b628797bc81a4455045c74e ]
The msg\_zerocopy test pins the sender and receiver threads to separate
cores to reduce variance between runs.
But it hardcodes the cores and skips core 0, so it fails on machines
with the selected cores offline, or simply fewer cores.
The test mainly gives code coverage in automated runs. The throughput
of zerocopy ('-z') and non-zerocopy runs is logged for manual
inspection.
Continue even when sched\_setaffinity fails. Just log to warn anyone
interpreting the data.

Revert "vxlan: fix tos value before xmit"
[ Upstream commit a0dced17ad9dc08b1b25e0065b54c97a318e6e8b ]
This reverts commit 71130f29979c7c7956b040673e6b9d5643003176.
In commit 71130f29979c ("vxlan: fix tos value before xmit") we want to
make sure the tos value are filtered by RT\_TOS() based on RFC1349.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| PRECEDENCE | TOS | MBZ |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
But RFC1349 has been obsoleted by RFC2474. The new DSCP field defined like
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| DS FIELD, DSCP | ECN FIELD |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
So with
IPTOS\_TOS\_MASK 0x1E
RT\_TOS(tos) ((tos)&IPTOS\_TOS\_MASK)
the first 3 bits DSCP info will get lost.
To take all the DSCP info in xmit, we should revert the patch and just push
all tos bits to ip\_tunnel\_ecn\_encap(), which will handling ECN field later.

net: gre: recompute gre csum for sctp over gre tunnels
[ Upstream commit 622e32b7d4a6492cf5c1f759ef833f817418f7b3 ]
The GRE tunnel can be used to transport traffic that does not rely on a
Internet checksum (e.g. SCTP). The issue can be triggered creating a GRE
or GRETAP tunnel and transmitting SCTP traffic ontop of it where CRC
offload has been disabled. In order to fix the issue we need to
recompute the GRE csum in gre\_gso\_segment() not relying on the inner
checksum.
The issue is still present when we have the CRC offload enabled.
In this case we need to disable the CRC offload if we require GRE
checksum since otherwise skb\_checksum() will report a wrong value.

Drop the bogus endpoint-lookup helper which could end up accepting

Note that the returned bulk pipes and interrupt endpoint descriptor
were never actually used. Instead the bulk-endpoint numbers are
hardcoded to 1 and 2 (matching the specification), while the interrupt-
endpoint descriptor was assumed to be the third descriptor created by

Try to bring some order to this by dropping the bogus lookup helper and
adding the missing endpoint sanity checks while keeping the interrupt-

vxlan: Ensure FDB dump is performed under RCU

The commit cited below removed the RCU read-side critical section from

This results in the following warning [1] in the VXLAN driver, which
relied on the callback being invoked from an RCU read-side critical
section.
Fix this by calling rcu\_read\_lock() in the VXLAN driver, as already done
in the bridge driver.

Additionally, they need to grow a \_locked variant, since callers might
call this with i\_rwsem held (like the NFS server code).

Drivers: hv: vmbus: Ignore CHANNELMSG\_TL\_CONNECT\_RESULT(23)
[ Upstream commit ddc9d357b991838c2d975e8d7e4e9db26f37a7ff ]
When a Linux hv\_sock app tries to connect to a Service GUID on which no
host app is listening, a recent host (RS3+) sends a
CHANNELMSG\_TL\_CONNECT\_RESULT (23) message to Linux and this triggers such
a warning:
unknown msgtype=23
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at drivers/hv/vmbus\_drv.c:1031 vmbus\_on\_msg\_dpc
Actually Linux can safely ignore the message because the Linux app's
connect() will time out in 2 seconds: see VSOCK\_DEFAULT\_CONNECT\_TIMEOUT
and vsock\_stream\_connect(). We don't bother to make use of the message
because: 1) it's only supported on recent hosts; 2) a non-trivial effort
is required to use the message in Linux, but the benefit is small.
So, let's not see the warning by silently ignoring the message.

atm: fix atm\_dev refcnt leaks in atmtcp\_remove\_persistent
[ Upstream commit 51875dad43b44241b46a569493f1e4bfa0386d86 ]
atmtcp\_remove\_persistent() invokes atm\_dev\_lookup(), which returns a
reference of atm\_dev with increased refcount or NULL if fails.
The refcount leaks issues occur in two error handling paths. If
dev\_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL, the function
returns 0 without decreasing the refcount kept by a local variable,
resulting in refcount leaks.
Fix the issue by adding atm\_dev\_put() before returning 0 both when
dev\_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL.

cfg80211: check vendor command doit pointer before use
[ Upstream commit 4052d3d2e8f47a15053320bbcbe365d15610437d ]
In the case where a vendor command does not implement doit, and has no
flags set, doit would not be validated and a NULL pointer dereference
would occur, for example when invoking the vendor command via iw.
I encountered this while developing new vendor commands. Perhaps in
practice it is advisable to always implement doit along with dumpit,
but it seems reasonable to me to always check doit anyway, not just
when NEED\_WDEV.

vgacon: Fix for missing check in scrollback handling
commit ebfdfeeae8c01fcb2b3b74ffaf03876e20835d2d upstream.
vgacon\_scrollback\_update() always leaves enbough room in the scrollback
buffer for the next call, but if the console size changed that room
might not actually be enough, and so we need to re-check.
The check should be in the loop since vgacon\_scrollback\_cur->tail is
updated in the loop and count may be more than 1 when triggered by CSI M,
as Jiri's PoC:
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main(int argc, char\*\* argv)
{
int fd = open("/dev/tty1", O\_RDWR);
unsigned short size[3] = {25, 200, 0};
ioctl(fd, 0x5609, size); // VT\_RESIZE
write(fd, "\e[1;1H", 6);
for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++)
write(fd, "\e[10M", 5);
}
It leads to various crashes as vgacon\_scrollback\_update writes out of
the buffer:
BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc900001752a0
#PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
#PF: error\_code(0x0002) - not-present page

binder: Prevent context manager from incrementing ref 0
commit 4b836a1426cb0f1ef2a6e211d7e553221594f8fc upstream.
Binder is designed such that a binder\_proc never has references to
itself. If this rule is violated, memory corruption can occur when a
process sends a transaction to itself; see e.g.
.
There is a remaining edgecase through which such a transaction-to-self
can still occur from the context of a task with BINDER\_SET\_CONTEXT\_MGR
access:
- task A opens /dev/binder twice, creating binder\_proc instances P1
and P2
- P1 becomes context manager
- P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 0 in its
handle table
- P1 dies (by closing the /dev/binder fd and waiting a bit)
- P2 becomes context manager
- P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 1 in its
handle table
[this triggers a warning: "binder: 1974:1974 tried to acquire
reference to desc 0, got 1 instead"]
- task B opens /dev/binder once, creating binder\_proc instance P3
- P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) with (void\*)1 as argument (two-way
transaction)
- P2 receives the handle and uses it to call P3 (two-way transaction)
- P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) (two-way transaction)
- P2 calls P2 (via handle 1) (two-way transaction)
And then, if P2 does \*NOT\* accept the incoming transaction work, but
instead closes the binder fd, we get a crash.
Solve it by preventing the context manager from using ACQUIRE on ref 0.
There shouldn't be any legitimate reason for the context manager to do
that.
Additionally, print a warning if someone manages to find another way to
trigger a transaction-to-self bug in the future.

The drm/omap driver was fixed to correct an issue where using a
divider of 32 breaks the DSS despite the TRM stating 32 is a valid
number. Through experimentation, it appears that 31 works, and
it is consistent with the value used by the drm/omap driver.
This patch fixes the divider for fbdev driver instead of the drm.

lock(&sb->s\_type->i\_mutex\_key#13);
kswapd takes fs\_reclaim and then inode\_lock while generic\_perform\_write
takes inode\_lock and then fs\_reclaim. However ashmem does not support
writing into backing shmem with a write syscall. The only way to change
its content is to mmap it and operate on mapped memory. Therefore the race
that lockdep is warning about is not valid. Resolve this by introducing a
separate lockdep class for the backing shmem inodes.

ALSA: seq: oss: Serialize ioctls
commit 80982c7e834e5d4e325b6ce33757012ecafdf0bb upstream.
Some ioctls via OSS sequencer API may race and lead to UAF when the
port create and delete are performed concurrently, as spotted by a
couple of syzkaller cases. This patch is an attempt to address it by
serializing the ioctls with the existing register\_mutex.
Basically OSS sequencer API is an obsoleted interface and was designed
without much consideration of the concurrency. There are very few
applications with it, and the concurrent performance isn't asked,
hence this "big hammer" approach should be good enough.

usb: xhci: Fix ASMedia ASM1142 DMA addressing
commit ec37198acca7b4c17b96247697406e47aafe0605 upstream.
I've confirmed that the ASMedia ASM1142 has the same problem as the
ASM2142/ASM3142, in that it too reports that it supports 64-bit DMA
addresses when in fact it does not. As with the ASM2142/ASM3142, this
can cause problems on systems where the upper bits matter, and adding
the XHCI\_NO\_64BIT\_SUPPORT quirk completely fixes the issue.

xen/gntdev: Fix dmabuf import with non-zero sgt offset
commit 5fa4e6f1c2d8c9a4e47e1931b42893172d388f2b upstream.
It is possible that the scatter-gather table during dmabuf import has
non-zero offset of the data, but user-space doesn't expect that.
Fix this by failing the import, so user-space doesn't access wrong data.

pgno number of pages, and thus the rest need to be subtracted before
returning or else accounting will be skewed.

irqdomain/treewide: Free firmware node after domain removal
commit ec0160891e387f4771f953b888b1fe951398e5d9 upstream.
Commit 711419e504eb ("irqdomain: Add the missing assignment of
domain->fwnode for named fwnode") unintentionally caused a dangling pointer
page fault issue on firmware nodes that were freed after IRQ domain
allocation. Commit e3beca48a45b fixed that dangling pointer issue by only
freeing the firmware node after an IRQ domain allocation failure. That fix
no longer frees the firmware node immediately, but leaves the firmware node
allocated after the domain is removed.
The firmware node must be kept around through irq\_domain\_remove, but should be
freed it afterwards.
Add the missing free operations after domain removal where where appropriate.

ARM: 8992/1: Fix unwind\_frame for clang-built kernels
commit b4d5ec9b39f8b31d98f65bc5577b5d15d93795d7 upstream.
Since clang does not push pc and sp in function prologues, the current
implementation of unwind\_frame does not work. By using the previous
frame's lr/fp instead of saved pc/sp we get valid unwinds on clang-built
kernels.
The bounds check on next frame pointer must be changed as well since
there are 8 less bytes between frames.
This fixes /proc//stack.

spi: spidev: Align buffers for DMA
commit aa9e862d7d5bcecd4dca9f39e8b684b93dd84ee7 upstream.
Simply copying all xfers from userspace into one bounce buffer causes
alignment problems if the SPI controller uses DMA.
Ensure that all transfer data blocks within the rx and tx bounce buffers
are aligned for DMA (according to ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN).
Alignment may increase the usage of the bounce buffers. In some cases,
the buffers may need to be increased using the "bufsiz" module
parameter.

cpufreq: dt: fix oops on armada37xx

Commit 0c868627e617e43a295d8 (cpufreq: dt: Allow platform specific
intermediate callbacks) added two function pointers to the
struct cpufreq\_dt\_platform\_data. However, armada37xx\_cpufreq\_driver\_init()
has this struct (pdata) located on the stack and uses only "suspend"
and "resume" fields. So these newly added "get\_intermediate" and
"target\_intermediate" pointers are uninitialized and contain arbitrary
non-null values, causing all kinds of trouble.
For instance, here is an oops on espressobin after an attempt to change
the cpefreq governor:

fs/minix: reject too-large maximum file size
commit 270ef41094e9fa95273f288d7d785313ceab2ff3 upstream.
If the minix filesystem tries to map a very large logical block number to
its on-disk location, block\_to\_path() can return offsets that are too
large, causing out-of-bounds memory accesses when accessing indirect index
blocks. This should be prevented by the check against the maximum file
size, but this doesn't work because the maximum file size is read directly
from the on-disk superblock and isn't validated itself.
Fix this by validating the maximum file size at mount time.

commit da27e0a0e5f655f0d58d4e153c3182bb2b290f64 upstream.
Patch series "fs/minix: fix syzbot bugs and set s\_maxbytes".
This series fixes all syzbot bugs in the minix filesystem:

KASAN: use-after-free Read in get\_block
WARNING in inc\_nlink

WARNING in drop\_nlink
It also fixes the minix filesystem to set s\_maxbytes correctly, so that
userspace sees the correct behavior when exceeding the max file size.
This patch (of 6):
sb\_getblk() can fail, so check its return value.
This fixes a NULL pointer dereference.

bitfield.h: don't compile-time validate \_val in FIELD\_FIT
commit 444da3f52407d74c9aa12187ac6b01f76ee47d62 upstream.
When ur\_load\_imm\_any() is inlined into jeq\_imm(), it's possible for the
compiler to deduce a case where \_val can only have the value of -1 at
compile time. Specifically,
/\* struct bpf\_insn: \_s32 imm \*/
u64 imm = insn->imm; /\* sign extend \*/
if (imm >> 32) { /\* non-zero only if insn->imm is negative \*/
/\* inlined from ur\_load\_imm\_any \*/
u32 \_\_imm = imm >> 32; /\* therefore, always 0xffffffff \*/
if (\_\_builtin\_constant\_p(\_\_imm) && \_\_imm > 255)
compiletime\_assert\_XXX()
This can result in tripping a BUILD\_BUG\_ON() in \_\_BF\_FIELD\_CHECK() that
checks that a given value is representable in one byte (interpreted as
unsigned).
FIELD\_FIT() should return true or false at runtime for whether a value
can fit for not. Don't break the build over a value that's too large for
the mask. We'd prefer to keep the inlining and compiler optimizations
though we know this case will always return false.

crypto: ccp - Fix use of merged scatterlists
commit 8a302808c60d441d9884cb00ea7f2b534f2e3ca5 upstream.
Running the crypto manager self tests with
CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_MANAGER\_EXTRA\_TESTS may result in several types of errors
when using the ccp-crypto driver:
alg: skcipher: cbc-des3-ccp encryption failed on test vector 0; expected\_error=0, actual\_error=-5 ...
alg: skcipher: ctr-aes-ccp decryption overran dst buffer on test vector 0 ...
alg: ahash: sha224-ccp test failed (wrong result) on test vector ...
These errors are the result of improper processing of scatterlists mapped
for DMA.
Given a scatterlist in which entries are merged as part of mapping the
scatterlist for DMA, the DMA length of a merged entry will reflect the
combined length of the entries that were merged. The subsequent
scatterlist entry will contain DMA information for the scatterlist entry
after the last merged entry, but the non-DMA information will be that of
the first merged entry.
The ccp driver does not take this scatterlist merging into account. To
address this, add a second scatterlist pointer to track the current
position in the DMA mapped representation of the scatterlist. Both the DMA
representation and the original representation of the scatterlist must be
tracked as while most of the driver can use just the DMA representation,
scatterlist\_map\_and\_copy() must use the original representation and
expects the scatterlist pointer to be accurate to the original
representation.
In order to properly walk the original scatterlist, the scatterlist must
be walked until the combined lengths of the entries seen is equal to the
DMA length of the current entry being processed in the DMA mapped
representation.

commit c06c76602e03bde24ee69a2022a829127e504202 upstream.
clang static analysis flags this error
qat\_uclo.c:297:3: warning: Attempt to free released memory
[unix.Malloc]
kfree(\*init\_tab\_base);
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When input \*init\_tab\_base is null, the function allocates memory for
the head of the list. When there is problem allocating other list
elements the list is unwound and freed. Then a check is made if the
list head was allocated and is also freed.
Keeping track of the what may need to be freed is the variable 'tail\_old'.
The unwinding/freeing block is
while (tail\_old) {
mem\_init = tail\_old->next;
kfree(tail\_old);
tail\_old = mem\_init;
}
The problem is that the first element of tail\_old is also what was
allocated for the list head
init\_header = kzalloc(sizeof(\*init\_header), GFP\_KERNEL);
...
\*init\_tab\_base = init\_header;
flag = 1;
}
tail\_old = init\_header;
So \*init\_tab\_base/init\_header are freed twice.
There is another problem.
When the input \*init\_tab\_base is non null the tail\_old is calculated by
traveling down the list to first non null entry.
tail\_old = init\_header;
while (tail\_old->next)
tail\_old = tail\_old->next;
When the unwinding free happens, the last entry of the input list will
be freed.
So the freeing needs a general changed.
If locally allocated the first element of tail\_old is freed, else it
is skipped. As a bit of cleanup, reset \*init\_tab\_base if it came in
as null.

pstore: Fix linking when crypto API disabled
commit fd49e03280e596e54edb93a91bc96170f8e97e4a upstream.
When building a kernel with CONFIG\_PSTORE=y and CONFIG\_CRYPTO not set,
a build error happens:
ld: fs/pstore/platform.o: in function `pstore\_dump':
platform.c:(.text+0x3f9): undefined reference to `crypto\_comp\_compress'
ld: fs/pstore/platform.o: in function `pstore\_get\_backend\_records':
platform.c:(.text+0x784): undefined reference to `crypto\_comp\_decompress'
This because some pstore code uses crypto\_comp\_(de)compress regardless
of the CONFIG\_CRYPTO status. Fix it by wrapping the (de)compress usage
by IS\_ENABLED(CONFIG\_PSTORE\_COMPRESS)

ALSA: usb-audio: work around streaming quirk for MacroSilicon MS2109
commit 1b7ecc241a67ad6b584e071bd791a54e0cd5f097 upstream.
Further investigation of the L-R swap problem on the MS2109 reveals that
the problem isn't that the channels are swapped, but rather that they
are swapped and also out of phase by one sample. In other words, the
issue is actually that the very first frame that comes from the hardware
is a half-frame containing only the right channel, and after that
everything becomes offset.
So introduce a new quirk field to drop the very first 2 bytes that come
in after the format is configured and a capture stream starts. This puts
the channels in phase and in the correct order.

After installing the Ubuntu Linux, the micmute led status is not

We tried the old linux kernel like linux-4.15, there is no this issue.

net: initialize fastreuse on inet\_inherit\_port
[ Upstream commit d76f3351cea2d927fdf70dd7c06898235035e84e ]
In the case of TPROXY, bind\_conflict optimizations for SO\_REUSEADDR or
SO\_REUSEPORT are broken, possibly resulting in O(n) instead of O(1) bind
behaviour or in the incorrect reuse of a bind.
the kernel keeps track for each bind\_bucket if all sockets in the
bind\_bucket support SO\_REUSEADDR or SO\_REUSEPORT in two fastreuse flags.
These flags allow skipping the costly bind\_conflict check when possible
(meaning when all sockets have the proper SO\_REUSE option).
For every socket added to a bind\_bucket, these flags need to be updated.
As soon as a socket that does not support reuse is added, the flag is
set to false and will never go back to true, unless the bind\_bucket is
deleted.
Note that there is no mechanism to re-evaluate these flags when a socket
is removed (this might make sense when removing a socket that would not
allow reuse; this leaves room for a future patch).
For this optimization to work, it is mandatory that these flags are
properly initialized and updated.
When a child socket is created from a listen socket in
\_\_inet\_inherit\_port, the TPROXY case could create a new bind bucket
without properly initializing these flags, thus preventing the
optimization to work. Alternatively, a socket not allowing reuse could
be added to an existing bind bucket without updating the flags, causing
bind\_conflict to never be called as it should.
Call inet\_csk\_update\_fastreuse when \_\_inet\_inherit\_port decides to create
a new bind\_bucket or use a different bind\_bucket than the one of the
listen socket.

drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Added needed\_headroom and a skb->len check
[ Upstream commit c7ca03c216acb14466a713fedf1b9f2c24994ef2 ]
1. Added a skb->len check
This driver expects upper layers to include a pseudo header of 1 byte
when passing down a skb for transmission. This driver will read this
1-byte header. This patch added a skb->len check before reading the
header to make sure the header exists.
2. Changed to use needed\_headroom instead of hard\_header\_len to request
necessary headroom to be allocated
In net/packet/af\_packet.c, the function packet\_snd first reserves a
headroom of length (dev->hard\_header\_len + dev->needed\_headroom).
Then if the socket is a SOCK\_DGRAM socket, it calls dev\_hard\_header,
which calls dev->header\_ops->create, to create the link layer header.
If the socket is a SOCK\_RAW socket, it "un-reserves" a headroom of
length (dev->hard\_header\_len), and assumes the user to provide the
appropriate link layer header.
So according to the logic of af\_packet.c, dev->hard\_header\_len should
be the length of the header that would be created by
dev->header\_ops->create.
However, this driver doesn't provide dev->header\_ops, so logically
dev->hard\_header\_len should be 0.
So we should use dev->needed\_headroom instead of dev->hard\_header\_len
to request necessary headroom to be allocated.
This change fixes kernel panic when this driver is used with AF\_PACKET
SOCK\_RAW sockets.

[ Upstream commit 88fd1cb80daa20af063bce81e1fad14e945a8dc4 ]
After @blk\_fill\_in\_prog\_lock is acquired there is an early out vnet
situation that can occur. In that case, the rwlock needs to be
released.
Also, since @blk\_fill\_in\_prog\_lock is only acquired when @tp\_version
is exactly TPACKET\_V3, only release it on that exact condition as
well.
And finally, add sparse annotation so that it is clearer that
prb\_fill\_curr\_block() and prb\_clear\_blk\_fill\_status() are acquiring
and releasing @blk\_fill\_in\_prog\_lock, respectively. sparse is still
unable to understand the balance, but the warnings are now on a
higher level that make more sense.

pinctrl-single: fix pcs\_parse\_pinconf() return value
[ Upstream commit f46fe79ff1b65692a65266a5bec6dbe2bf7fc70f ]
This patch causes pcs\_parse\_pinconf() to return -ENOTSUPP when no
pinctrl\_map is added. The current behavior is to return 0 when
!PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF or !nconfs. Thus pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry()
incorrectly assumes that a map was added and sets num\_maps = 2.
Analysis:
=========
The function pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() calls pcs\_parse\_pinconf()
if PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF is enabled. The function pcs\_parse\_pinconf()
returns 0 to indicate there was no error and num\_maps is then set to 2:
980 static int pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry(struct pcs\_device \*pcs,
981 struct device\_node \*np,
982 struct pinctrl\_map \*\*map,
983 unsigned \*num\_maps,
984 const char \*\*pgnames)
985 {
1053 (\*map)->type = PIN\_MAP\_TYPE\_MUX\_GROUP;
1054 (\*map)->data.mux.group = np->name;
1055 (\*map)->data.mux.function = np->name;
1056
1057 if (PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF && function) {
1058 res = pcs\_parse\_pinconf(pcs, np, function, map);
1059 if (res)
1060 goto free\_pingroups;
1061 \*num\_maps = 2;
1062 } else {
1063 \*num\_maps = 1;
1064 }
However, pcs\_parse\_pinconf() will also return 0 if !PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF or
!nconfs. I believe these conditions should indicate that no map was
added by returning -ENOTSUPP. Otherwise pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry()
will set num\_maps = 2 even though no maps were successfully added, as
it does not reach "m++" on line 940:
895 static int pcs\_parse\_pinconf(struct pcs\_device \*pcs, struct device\_node \*np,
896 struct pcs\_function \*func,
897 struct pinctrl\_map \*\*map)

917 /\* If pinconf isn't supported, don't parse properties in below. \*/
918 if (!PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF)
919 return 0;
920
921 /\* cacluate how much properties are supported in current node \*/
922 for (i = 0; i < ARRAY\_SIZE(prop2); i++) {
923 if (of\_find\_property(np, prop2[i].name, NULL))
924 nconfs++;
925 }
926 for (i = 0; i < ARRAY\_SIZE(prop4); i++) {
927 if (of\_find\_property(np, prop4[i].name, NULL))

(AM3358) when am33xx\_pinmux node in arch/arm/boot/dts/am33xx-l4.dtsi

The patch fixes this issue by returning -ENOSUPP when !PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF
or !nconfs, so that pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() will know that no
map was added.
Logic is also added to pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() to distinguish
between -ENOSUPP and other errors. In the case of -ENOSUPP, num\_maps
is set to 1 as it is valid for pinconf to be enabled and a given pin
group to not any pinconf properties.

tools, build: Propagate build failures from tools/build/Makefile.build
[ Upstream commit a278f3d8191228212c553a5d4303fa603214b717 ]
The '&&' command seems to have a bad effect when $(cmd\_$(1)) exits with
non-zero effect: the command failure is masked (despite `set -e`) and all but
the first command of $(dep-cmd) is executed (successfully, as they are mostly
printfs), thus overall returning 0 in the end.
This means in practice that despite compilation errors, tools's build Makefile
will return success. We see this very reliably with libbpf's Makefile, which
doesn't get compilation error propagated properly. This in turns causes issues
with selftests build, as well as bpftool and other projects that rely on
building libbpf.
The fix is simple: don't use &&. Given `set -e`, we don't need to chain
commands with &&. The shell will exit on first failure, giving desired
behavior and propagating error properly.

The RTL8366 would not handle adding new members (ports) to

called once for a single port. When intializing the
switch with .configure\_vlan\_while\_not\_filtering set to
true, the function is called numerous times for adding
all ports to VLAN1, which was something the code could
not handle.
Alter rtl8366\_set\_vlan() to just |= new members and
untagged flags to 4k and MC VLAN table entries alike.
This makes it possible to just add new ports to a
VLAN.

In theory, a panic can happen after a bus or host reset with dma\_started
flag set. Fix this by halting the DMA before reinitializing the host.
Don't assume that ms->current\_req is set when halt\_dma() is invoked as it
may not hold for bus or host reset.
BTW, this particular Conner drive can be made to work by inhibiting
disconnect/reselect with 'mesh.resel\_targets=0'.

usb: dwc2: Fix error path in gadget registration
[ Upstream commit 33a06f1300a79cfd461cea0268f05e969d4f34ec ]
When gadget registration fails, one should not call usb\_del\_gadget\_udc().
Ensure this by setting gadget->udc to NULL. Also in case of a failure
there is no need to disable low-level hardware, so return immiedetly
instead of jumping to error\_init label.
This fixes the following kernel NULL ptr dereference on gadget failure
(can be easily triggered with g\_mass\_storage without any module
parameters):

While fixing this also fix the double call to dwc2\_lowlevel\_hw\_disable()
if dr\_mode is set to USB\_DR\_MODE\_PERIPHERAL. In such case low-level
hardware is already disabled before calling usb\_add\_gadget\_udc(). That
function correctly preserves low-level hardware state, there is no need
for the second unconditional dwc2\_lowlevel\_hw\_disable() call.

The function quirks\_param\_set() takes as argument a const char\* pointer
to the new value of the usbcore.quirks parameter. It then casts this
pointer to a non-const char\* pointer and passes it to the strsep()

The set-led command is eight bytes long and starts with a command byte
followed by six bytes of RGB data and ends with a byte encoding a
frequency (see iuu\_led() and iuu\_rgbf\_fill\_buffer()).
The led activity helpers had a few long-standing bugs which corrupted
the command packets by inserting a second command byte and thereby
offsetting the RGB data and dropping the frequency in non-xmas mode.
In xmas mode, a related off-by-one error left the frequency field
uninitialised.

powerpc/vdso: Fix vdso cpu truncation
[ Upstream commit a9f675f950a07d5c1dbcbb97aabac56f5ed085e3 ]
The code in vdso\_cpu\_init that exposes the cpu and numa node to
userspace via SPRG\_VDSO incorrctly masks the cpu to 12 bits. This means
that any kernel running on a box with more than 4096 threads (NR\_CPUS
advertises a limit of of 8192 cpus) would expose userspace to two cpu
contexts running at the same time with the same cpu number.
Note: I'm not aware of any distro shipping a kernel with support for more

PCI: Fix pci\_cfg\_wait queue locking problem
[ Upstream commit 2a7e32d0547f41c5ce244f84cf5d6ca7fccee7eb ]
The pci\_cfg\_wait queue is used to prevent user-space config accesses to
devices while they are recovering from reset.
Previously we used these operations on pci\_cfg\_wait:
\_\_add\_wait\_queue(&pci\_cfg\_wait, ...)
\_\_remove\_wait\_queue(&pci\_cfg\_wait, ...)
wake\_up\_all(&pci\_cfg\_wait)
The wake\_up acquires the wait queue lock, but the add and remove do not.
Originally these were all protected by the pci\_lock, but cdcb33f98244
("PCI: Avoid possible deadlock on pci\_lock and p->pi\_lock"), moved
wake\_up\_all() outside pci\_lock, so it could race with add/remove
operations, which caused occasional kernel panics, e.g., during vfio-pci
hotplug/unplug testing:
Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address ffff802dac469000
Resolve this by using wait\_event() instead of \_\_add\_wait\_queue() and
\_\_remove\_wait\_queue(). The wait queue lock is held by both wait\_event()
and wake\_up\_all(), so it provides mutual exclusion.

xfs: don't eat an EIO/ENOSPC writeback error when scrubbing data fork
[ Upstream commit eb0efe5063bb10bcb653e4f8e92a74719c03a347 ]
The data fork scrubber calls filemap\_write\_and\_wait to flush dirty pages
and delalloc reservations out to disk prior to checking the data fork's
extent mappings. Unfortunately, this means that scrub can consume the
EIO/ENOSPC errors that would otherwise have stayed around in the address
space until (we hope) the writer application calls fsync to persist data
and collect errors. The end result is that programs that wrote to a
file might never see the error code and proceed as if nothing were
wrong.
xfs\_scrub is not in a position to notify file writers about the
writeback failure, and it's only here to check metadata, not file
contents. Therefore, if writeback fails, we should stuff the error code
back into the address space so that an fsync by the writer application
can pick that up.

ipvs: allow connection reuse for unconfirmed conntrack
[ Upstream commit f0a5e4d7a594e0fe237d3dfafb069bb82f80f42f ]
YangYuxi is reporting that connection reuse
is causing one-second delay when SYN hits
existing connection in TIME\_WAIT state.
Such delay was added to give time to expire
both the IPVS connection and the corresponding
conntrack. This was considered a rare case
at that time but it is causing problem for
some environments such as Kubernetes.
As nf\_conntrack\_tcp\_packet() can decide to
release the conntrack in TIME\_WAIT state and
to replace it with a fresh NEW conntrack, we
can use this to allow rescheduling just by
tuning our check: if the conntrack is
confirmed we can not schedule it to different
real server and the one-second delay still
applies but if new conntrack was created,
we are free to select new real server without
any delays.
YangYuxi lists some of the problem reports:
- One second connection delay in masquerading mode:
https://marc.info/?t=151683118100004&r=1&w=2
- IPVS low throughput #70747

ACPICA: Do not increment operation\_region reference counts for field units
[ Upstream commit 6a54ebae6d047c988a31f5ac5a64ab5cf83797a2 ]
ACPICA commit e17b28cfcc31918d0db9547b6b274b09c413eb70
Object reference counts are used as a part of ACPICA's garbage
collection mechanism. This mechanism keeps track of references to
heap-allocated structures such as the ACPI operand objects.
Recent server firmware has revealed that this reference count can
overflow on large servers that declare many field units under the
same operation\_region. This occurs because each field unit declaration
will add a reference count to the source operation\_region.
This change solves the reference count overflow for operation\_regions
objects by preventing fieldunits from incrementing their
operation\_region's reference count. Each operation\_region's reference
count will not be changed by named objects declared under the Field
operator. During namespace deletion, the operation\_region namespace
node will be deleted and each fieldunit will be deleted without
touching the deleted operation\_region object.

bcache: fix super block seq numbers comparision in register\_cache\_set()
[ Upstream commit 117f636ea695270fe492d0c0c9dfadc7a662af47 ]
In register\_cache\_set(), c is pointer to struct cache\_set, and ca is
pointer to struct cache, if ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq, it means this
registering cache has up to date version and other members, the in-
memory version and other members should be updated to the newer value.
But current implementation makes a cache set only has a single cache
device, so the above assumption works well except for a special case.
The execption is when a cache device new created and both ca->sb.seq and
c->sb.seq are 0, because the super block is never flushed out yet. In
the location for the following if() check,
2156 if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq) {
2157 c->sb.version = ca->sb.version;
2158 memcpy(c->sb.set\_uuid, ca->sb.set\_uuid, 16);
2159 c->sb.flags = ca->sb.flags;
2160 c->sb.seq = ca->sb.seq;
2161 pr\_debug("set version = %llu\n", c->sb.version);
2162 }
c->sb.version is not initialized yet and valued 0. When ca->sb.seq is 0,
the if() check will fail (because both values are 0), and the cache set
version, set\_uuid, flags and seq won't be updated.
The above problem is hiden for current code, because the bucket size is
compatible among different super block version. And the next time when
running cache set again, ca->sb.seq will be larger than 0 and cache set
super block version will be updated properly.
But if the large bucket feature is enabled, sb->bucket\_size is the low
16bits of the bucket size. For a power of 2 value, when the actual
bucket size exceeds 16bit width, sb->bucket\_size will always be 0. Then
read\_super\_common() will fail because the if() check to
is\_power\_of\_2(sb->bucket\_size) is false. This is how the long time
hidden bug is triggered.
This patch modifies the if() check to the following way,
2156 if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq || c->sb.seq == 0) {
Then cache set's version, set\_uuid, flags and seq will always be updated
corectly including for a new created cache device.

ddebug\_describe\_flags() currently fills a caller provided string buffer,
after testing its size (also passed) in a BUG\_ON. Fix this by
replacing them with a known-big-enough string buffer wrapped in a
struct, and passing that instead.
Also simplify ddebug\_describe\_flags() flags parameter from a struct to
a member in that struct, and hoist the member deref up to the caller.
This makes the function reusable (soon) where flags are unpacked.

brcmfmac: keep SDIO watchdog running when console\_interval is non-zero
[ Upstream commit eccbf46b15bb3e35d004148f7c3a8fa8e9b26c1e ]
brcmfmac host driver makes SDIO bus sleep and stops SDIO watchdog if no
pending event or data. As a result, host driver does not poll firmware
console buffer before buffer overflow, which leads to missing firmware
logs. We should not stop SDIO watchdog if console\_interval is non-zero
in debug build.

[ Upstream commit edcb3895a751c762a18d25c8d9846ce9759ed7e1 ]
neofb\_probe() calls neo\_scan\_monitor() that can successfully allocate a
memory for info->monspecs.modedb and proceed to case 0x03. There it does
not free the memory and returns -1. neofb\_probe() goes to label
err\_scan\_monitor, thus, it does not free this memory through calling
fb\_destroy\_modedb() as well. We can not go to label err\_init\_hw since
neo\_scan\_monitor() can fail during memory allocation. So, the patch frees
the memory directly for case 0x03.

Craig Topper suggested me in ClangBuiltLinux issue #1050:
> I think the "too many positional arguments" is because the parser isn't able
> to handle the trailing commas.

> The "unknown use of instruction mnemonic" is because the macro was named
> GHASH\_4\_ENCRYPT\_4\_PARALLEL\_DEC but its being instantiated with
> GHASH\_4\_ENCRYPT\_4\_PARALLEL\_dec I guess gas ignores case on the
> macro instantiation, but llvm doesn't.
First, I removed the trailing comma in the PRECOMPUTE line.
Second, I substituted:
1. GHASH\_4\_ENCRYPT\_4\_PARALLEL\_DEC -> GHASH\_4\_ENCRYPT\_4\_PARALLEL\_dec
2. GHASH\_4\_ENCRYPT\_4\_PARALLEL\_ENC -> GHASH\_4\_ENCRYPT\_4\_PARALLEL\_enc
With these changes I was able to build with LLVM\_IAS=1 and boot on bare metal.
I confirmed that this works with Linux-kernel v5.7.5 final.
NOTE: This patch is on top of Linux v5.7 final.
Thanks to Craig and especially Nick for double-checking and his comments.

values do not have any extraneous bits that will clear interrupt flags.
To place the SCC IOP into bypass mode would be desirable but this is not
achieved by writing IOP\_DMAINACTIVE | IOP\_RUN | IOP\_AUTOINC | IOP\_BYPASS
to the control register. Drop this ineffective register write.
Remove the flawed and unused iop\_bypass() function. Make use of the

[ Upstream commit aeb445bf2194d83e12e85bf5c65baaf1f093bd8f ]

"send" channel is not in the IOP\_MSG\_IDLE state:
iop\_ism\_irq()
iop\_handle\_send()
(msg->handler)()
iop\_send\_message()
iop\_do\_send()
Avoid this by testing the channel state before calling iop\_do\_send().
When sending, and iop\_send\_queue is empty, call iop\_do\_send() because
the channel is idle. If iop\_send\_queue is not empty, iop\_do\_send() will
get called later by iop\_handle\_send().

clk: scmi: Fix min and max rate when registering clocks with discrete rates
[ Upstream commit fcd2e0deae50bce48450f14c8fc5611b08d7438c ]
Currently we are not initializing the scmi clock with discrete rates
correctly. We fetch the min\_rate and max\_rate value only for clocks with
ranges and ignore the ones with discrete rates. This will lead to wrong
initialization of rate range when clock supports discrete rate.
Fix this by using the first and the last rate in the sorted list of the
discrete clock rates while registering the clock.

[ Upstream commit 1b6a1a162defe649c5599d661b58ac64bb6f31b6 ]
msm8916-pins.dtsi specifies "bias-pull-none" for most of the audio
pin configurations. This was likely copied from the qcom kernel fork
where the same property was used for these audio pins.
However, "bias-pull-none" actually does not exist at all - not in
mainline and not in downstream. I can only guess that the original
intention was to configure "no pull", i.e. bias-disable.
Change it to that instead.

EDAC: Fix reference count leaks
[ Upstream commit 17ed808ad243192fb923e4e653c1338d3ba06207 ]
When kobject\_init\_and\_add() returns an error, it should be handled
because kobject\_init\_and\_add() takes a reference even when it fails. If
this function returns an error, kobject\_put() must be called to properly
clean up the memory associated with the object.
Therefore, replace calling kfree() and call kobject\_put() and add a
missing kobject\_put() in the edac\_device\_register\_sysfs\_main\_kobj()
error path.

HID: input: Fix devices that return multiple bytes in battery report
commit 4f57cace81438cc873a96f9f13f08298815c9b51 upstream.
Some devices, particularly the 3DConnexion Spacemouse wireless 3D
controllers, return more than just the battery capacity in the battery
report. The Spacemouse devices return an additional byte with a device
specific field. However, hidinput\_query\_battery\_capacity() only
requests a 2 byte transfer.
When a spacemouse is connected via USB (direct wire, no wireless dongle)
and it returns a 3 byte report instead of the assumed 2 byte battery
report the larger transfer confuses and frightens the USB subsystem
which chooses to ignore the transfer. Then after 2 seconds assume the
device has stopped responding and reset it. This can be reproduced
easily by using a wired connection with a wireless spacemouse. The
Spacemouse will enter a loop of resetting every 2 seconds which can be
observed in dmesg.
This patch solves the problem by increasing the transfer request to 4
bytes instead of 2. The fix isn't particularly elegant, but it is simple
and safe to backport to stable kernels. A further patch will follow to
more elegantly handle battery reports that contain additional data.

tracepoint: Mark \_\_tracepoint\_string's \_\_used
commit f3751ad0116fb6881f2c3c957d66a9327f69cefb upstream.
\_\_tracepoint\_string's have their string data stored in .rodata, and an
address to that data stored in the "\_\_tracepoint\_str" section. Functions
that refer to those strings refer to the symbol of the address. Compiler
optimization can replace those address references with references
directly to the string data. If the address doesn't appear to have other
uses, then it appears dead to the compiler and is removed. This can
break the /tracing/printk\_formats sysfs node which iterates the
addresses stored in the "\_\_tracepoint\_str" section.
Like other strings stored in custom sections in this header, mark these
\_\_used to inform the compiler that there are other non-obvious users of
the address, so they should still be emitted.

cgroup: fix cgroup\_sk\_alloc() for sk\_clone\_lock()[ Upstream commit ad0f75e5f57ccbceec13274e1e242f2b5a6397ed ]
When we clone a socket in sk\_clone\_lock(), its sk\_cgrp\_data is
copied, so the cgroup refcnt must be taken too. And, unlike the
sk\_alloc() path, sock\_update\_netprioidx() is not called here.
Therefore, it is safe and necessary to grab the cgroup refcnt
even when cgroup\_sk\_alloc is disabled.
sk\_clone\_lock() is in BH context anyway, the in\_interrupt()
would terminate this function if called there. And for sk\_alloc()
skcd->val is always zero. So it's safe to factor out the code
to make it more readable.
The global variable 'cgroup\_sk\_alloc\_disabled' is used to determine
whether to take these reference counts. It is impossible to make
the reference counting correct unless we save this bit of information
in skcd->val. So, add a new bit there to record whether the socket
has already taken the reference counts. This obviously relies on
kmalloc() to align cgroup pointers to at least 4 bytes,
ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN is certainly larger than that.
This bug seems to be introduced since the beginning, commit
d979a39d7242 ("cgroup: duplicate cgroup reference when cloning sockets")
tried to fix it but not compeletely. It seems not easy to trigger until
the recent commit 090e28b229af
("netprio\_cgroup: Fix unlimited memory leak of v2 cgroups") was merged.
Fixes: bd1060a1d671 ("sock, cgroup: add sock->sk\_cgroup")

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1868453#c0)  Alex    2020-08-12 18:10:33 UTC  ``` It was found that the Linux kernel's use after free issue could happen during the usage of cgroupv2 (usually when reboot and more likely if virtual machine or docker being used). After recent commit 090e28b ("netprio_cgroup: Fix unlimited memory leak of v2 cgroups") was merged, the problem could be reproduced much simpler starting with 5.7.x kernels. The problem introduced with 4.5 kernel, but there is no known way to trigger it, so it was not known until 5.7 kernel. It could be possible to reproduce the bug by the user without privileges and without reboot if user has an ability to create/close cgroupv2 or this user create a process which is attached to already existing cgroupv2 BPF (but still the user will have to wait till root manually closes cgroupv2 or system is being rebooted).  This commit fixes the problem: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/94886c86e833dbc8995202b6c6aaff592b7abd24>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1868453#c1)  Alex    2020-08-12 18:10:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Adam Zabrocki (pi3.com.pl)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1868453#c4)  Alex    2020-08-12 19:43:34 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1868479](show_bug.cgi?id=1868479 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14356 kernel: Use After Free vulnerability in cgroup BPF component [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1868453#c5)  Justin M.

mm: Avoid calling build\_all\_zonelists\_init under hotplug context
Recently a customer of ours experienced a crash when booting the
system while enabling memory-hotplug.
The problem is that Normal zones on different nodes don't get their private
zone->pageset allocated, and keep sharing the initial boot\_pageset.
The sharing between zones is normally safe as explained by the comment for
boot\_pageset - it's a percpu structure, and manipulations are done with
disabled interrupts, and boot\_pageset is set up in a way that any page placed
on its pcplist is immediately flushed to shared zone's freelist, because
pcp->high == 1.
However, the hotplug operation updates pcp->high to a higher value as it
expects to be operating on a private pageset.
The problem is in build\_all\_zonelists(), which is called when the first range
of pages is onlined for the Normal zone of node X or Y:
if (system\_state == SYSTEM\_BOOTING) {
build\_all\_zonelists\_init();
} else {
#ifdef CONFIG\_MEMORY\_HOTPLUG
if (zone)
setup\_zone\_pageset(zone);
#endif
/\* we have to stop all cpus to guarantee there is no user
of zonelist \*/
stop\_machine(\_\_build\_all\_zonelists, pgdat, NULL);
/\* cpuset refresh routine should be here \*/
}
When called during hotplug, it should execute the setup\_zone\_pageset(zone)
which allocates the private pageset.
However, with memhp\_default\_state=online, this happens early while
system\_state == SYSTEM\_BOOTING is still true, hence this step is skipped.
(and build\_all\_zonelists\_init() is probably unsafe anyway at this point).
Another hotplug operation on the same zone then leads to zone\_pcp\_update(zone)
called from online\_pages(), which updates the pcp->high for the shared
boot\_pageset to a value higher than 1.
At that point, pages freed from Node X and Y Normal zones can end up on the same
pcplist and from there they can be freed to the wrong zone's freelist,
leading to the corruption and crashes.
Please, note that upstream has fixed that differently (and unintentionally) by
adding another boot state (SYSTEM\_SCHEDULING), which is set before smp\_init().
That should happen before memory hotplug events even with memhp\_default\_state=online.
Backporting that would be too intrusive.

commit dc3ff4f698afdbb7da438ecf4a2f56486288ddec

khugepaged: retract\_page\_tables() remember to test exit
commit 18e77600f7a1ed69f8ce46c9e11cad0985712dfa upstream.
Only once have I seen this scenario (and forgot even to notice what forced
the eventual crash): a sequence of "BUG: Bad page map" alerts from
vm\_normal\_page(), from zap\_pte\_range() servicing exit\_mmap();
pmd:00000000, pte values corresponding to data in physical page 0.
The pte mappings being zapped in this case were supposed to be from a huge
page of ext4 text (but could as well have been shmem): my belief is that
it was racing with collapse\_file()'s retract\_page\_tables(), found \*pmd
pointing to a page table, locked it, but \*pmd had become 0 by the time
start\_pte was decided.
In most cases, that possibility is excluded by holding mmap lock; but
exit\_mmap() proceeds without mmap lock. Most of what's run by khugepaged
checks khugepaged\_test\_exit() after acquiring mmap lock:
khugepaged\_collapse\_pte\_mapped\_thps() and hugepage\_vma\_revalidate() do so,
for example. But retract\_page\_tables() did not: fix that.
The fix is for retract\_page\_tables() to check khugepaged\_test\_exit(),
after acquiring mmap lock, before doing anything to the page table.
Getting the mmap lock serializes with \_\_mmput(), which briefly takes and
drops it in \_\_khugepaged\_exit(); then the khugepaged\_test\_exit() check on
mm\_users makes sure we don't touch the page table once exit\_mmap() might
reach it, since exit\_mmap() will be proceeding without mmap lock, not
expecting anyone to be racing with it.

sh: landisk: Add missing initialization of sh\_io\_port\_base
[ Upstream commit 0c64a0dce51faa9c706fdf1f957d6f19878f4b81 ]
The Landisk setup code maps the CF IDE area using ioremap\_prot(), and
passes the resulting virtual addresses to the pata\_platform driver,
disguising them as I/O port addresses. Hence the pata\_platform driver
translates them again using ioport\_map().
As CONFIG\_GENERIC\_IOMAP=n, and CONFIG\_HAS\_IOPORT\_MAP=y, the
SuperH-specific mapping code in arch/sh/kernel/ioport.c translates
I/O port addresses to virtual addresses by adding sh\_io\_port\_base, which
defaults to -1, thus breaking the assumption of an identity mapping.
Fix this by setting sh\_io\_port\_base to zero.

Use a event spinlock to protect event handler from being interrupted.
Note, that there are only two users of this GPIO and ADC drivers and both of

In the first loop, we increment "i" after the "if (i == unit)" condition
so we don't necessarily know that "i" is not equal to unit at the end of
the loop.
In the second loop we exit when mode is not pointing to a valid

watchdog: f71808e\_wdt: clear watchdog timeout occurred flag
commit 4f39d575844148fbf3081571a1f3b4ae04150958 upstream.
The flag indicating a watchdog timeout having occurred normally persists
till Power-On Reset of the Fintek Super I/O chip. The user can clear it
by writing a `1' to the bit.
The driver doesn't offer a restart method, so regular system reboot
might not reset the Super I/O and if the watchdog isn't enabled, we
won't touch the register containing the bit on the next boot.
In this case all subsequent regular reboots will be wrongly flagged
by the driver as being caused by the watchdog.
Fix this by having the flag cleared after read. This is also done by
other drivers like those for the i6300esb and mpc8xxx\_wdt.

watchdog: f71808e\_wdt: remove use of wrong watchdog\_info option
commit 802141462d844f2e6a4d63a12260d79b7afc4c34 upstream.
The flags that should be or-ed into the watchdog\_info.options by drivers
all start with WDIOF\_, e.g. WDIOF\_SETTIMEOUT, which indicates that the
driver's watchdog\_ops has a usable set\_timeout.
WDIOC\_SETTIMEOUT was used instead, which expands to 0xc0045706, which
equals:
WDIOF\_FANFAULT | WDIOF\_EXTERN1 | WDIOF\_PRETIMEOUT | WDIOF\_ALARMONLY |
WDIOF\_MAGICCLOSE | 0xc0045000
These were so far indicated to userspace on WDIOC\_GETSUPPORT.
As the driver has not yet been migrated to the new watchdog kernel API,
the constant can just be dropped without substitute.

Call Trace:
ftrace\_ops\_assist\_func+0x56/0xe0
ftrace\_call+0x5/0x34
tcpa\_statistic\_send+0x5/0x130 [ttcp\_engine]
The tcpa\_statistic\_send is the function being kprobed. After analysis,
the root cause is that the fourth parameter regs of kprobe\_ftrace\_handler
is NULL. Why regs is NULL? We use the crash tool to analyze the kdump.
crash> dis tcpa\_statistic\_send -r
: callq 0xffffffffbd8018c0
The tcpa\_statistic\_send calls ftrace\_caller instead of ftrace\_regs\_caller.
So it is reasonable that the fourth parameter regs of kprobe\_ftrace\_handler
is NULL. In theory, we should call the ftrace\_regs\_caller instead of the
ftrace\_caller. After in-depth analysis, we found a reproducible path.
Writing a simple kernel module which starts a periodic timer. The
timer's handler is named 'kprobe\_test\_timer\_handler'. The module
name is kprobe\_test.ko.
1) insmod kprobe\_test.ko
2) bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:kprobe\_test\_timer\_handler {}'
3) echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace\_enabled
4) rmmod kprobe\_test
5) stop step 2) kprobe
6) insmod kprobe\_test.ko
7) bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:kprobe\_test\_timer\_handler {}'
We mark the kprobe as GONE but not disarm the kprobe in the step 4).
The step 5) also do not disarm the kprobe when unregister kprobe. So
we do not remove the ip from the filter. In this case, when the module
loads again in the step 6), we will replace the code to ftrace\_caller
via the ftrace\_module\_enable(). When we register kprobe again, we will
not replace ftrace\_caller to ftrace\_regs\_caller because the ftrace is
disabled in the step 3). So the step 7) will trigger kernel panic. Fix
this problem by disarming the kprobe when the module is going away.

ftrace: Setup correct FTRACE\_FL\_REGS flags for module
commit 8a224ffb3f52b0027f6b7279854c71a31c48fc97 upstream.
When module loaded and enabled, we will use \_\_ftrace\_replace\_code
for module if any ftrace\_ops referenced it found. But we will get
wrong ftrace\_addr for module rec in ftrace\_get\_addr\_new, because
rec->flags has not been setup correctly. It can cause the callback
function of a ftrace\_ops has FTRACE\_OPS\_FL\_SAVE\_REGS to be called
with pt\_regs set to NULL.
So setup correct FTRACE\_FL\_REGS flags for rec when we call
referenced\_filters to find ftrace\_ops references it.

sbi->s\_freeinodes\_counter is only decreased by the ext2 code, it is never

Note that sbi->s\_freeinodes\_counter is only used in the algorithm that
tries to find the group for new allocations, so this bug is not easily
visible (the only visibility is that the group finding algorithm selects
inoptinal result).

bcache: allocate meta data pages as compound pages
commit 5fe48867856367142d91a82f2cbf7a57a24cbb70 upstream.
There are some meta data of bcache are allocated by multiple pages,
and they are used as bio bv\_page for I/Os to the cache device. for
example cache\_set->uuids, cache->disk\_buckets, journal\_write->data,
bset\_tree->data.
For such meta data memory, all the allocated pages should be treated
as a single memory block. Then the memory management and underlying I/O
code can treat them more clearly.
This patch adds \_\_GFP\_COMP flag to all the location allocating >0 order
pages for the above mentioned meta data. Then their pages are treated
as compound pages now.

md/raid5: Fix Force reconstruct-write io stuck in degraded raid5
commit a1c6ae3d9f3dd6aa5981a332a6f700cf1c25edef upstream.
In degraded raid5, we need to read parity to do reconstruct-write when
data disks fail. However, we can not read parity from
handle\_stripe\_dirtying() in force reconstruct-write mode.
Reproducible Steps:
1. Create degraded raid5
mdadm -C /dev/md2 --assume-clean -l5 -n3 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 missing
2. Set rmw\_level to 0
echo 0 > /sys/block/md2/md/rmw\_level
3. IO to raid5
Now some io may be stuck in raid5. We can use handle\_stripe\_fill() to read
the parity in this situation.

commit df43dd526e6609769ae513a81443c7aa727c8ca3 upstream.
The IPQ806x does not appear to have a functional multicast ethernet
address filter. This was observed as a failure to correctly receive IPv6
packets on a LAN to the all stations address. Checking the vendor driver
shows that it does not attempt to enable the multicast filter and
instead falls back to receiving all multicast packets, internally
setting ALLMULTI.
Use the new fallback support in the dwmac1000 driver to correctly
achieve the same with the mainline IPQ806x driver. Confirmed to fix IPv6

powerpc: Fix circular dependency between percpu.h and mmu.h
commit 0c83b277ada72b585e6a3e52b067669df15bcedb upstream.
Recently random.h started including percpu.h (see commit
f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt and
activity")), which broke corenet64\_smp\_defconfig:
In file included from /linux/arch/powerpc/include/asm/paca.h:18,

from /linux/include/linux/random.h:14,

/linux/arch/powerpc/include/asm/mmu.h:139:22: error: unknown type name 'next\_tlbcam\_idx'
139 | DECLARE\_PER\_CPU(int, next\_tlbcam\_idx);
This is due to a circular header dependency:
asm/mmu.h includes asm/percpu.h, which includes asm/paca.h, which
includes asm/mmu.h
Which means DECLARE\_PER\_CPU() isn't defined when mmu.h needs it.
We can fix it by moving the include of paca.h below the include of
asm-generic/percpu.h.
This moves the include of paca.h out of the #ifdef \_\_powerpc64\_\_, but
that is OK because paca.h is almost entirely inside #ifdef
CONFIG\_PPC64 anyway.
It also moves the include of paca.h out of the #ifdef CONFIG\_SMP,
which could possibly break something, but seems to have no ill
effects.

While logging an inode, at copy\_items(), if we fail to lookup the checksums
for an extent we release the destination path, free the ins\_data array and
then return immediately. However a previous iteration of the for loop may
have added checksums to the ordered\_sums list, in which case we leak the
memory used by them.
So fix this by making sure we iterate the ordered\_sums list and free all
its checksums before returning.

right of the entry we are adding to see if they can be merged. We
search for an entry past our current info (saved into right\_info), and
then if right\_info exists and it has a rb\_prev() we save the rb\_prev()
into left\_info.
However there's a slight problem in the case that we have a right\_info,
but no entry previous to that entry. At that point we will search for
an entry just before the info we're attempting to insert. This will
simply find right\_info again, and assign it to left\_info, making them
both the same pointer.
Now if right\_info \_can\_ be merged with the range we're inserting, we'll
add it to the info and free right\_info. However further down we'll
access left\_info, which was right\_info, and thus get a use-after-free.
Fix this by only searching for the left entry if we don't find a right
entry at all.
The CVE referenced had a specially crafted file system that could
trigger this use-after-free. However with the tree checker improvements
we no longer trigger the conditions for the UAF. But the original
conditions still apply, hence this fix.

btrfs: don't allocate anonymous block device for user invisible roots
commit 851fd730a743e072badaf67caf39883e32439431 upstream.
[BUG]
When a lot of subvolumes are created, there is a user report about
transaction aborted:

BTRFS warning (device sda1): Skipping commit of aborted transaction.
BTRFS: error (device sda1) in cleanup\_transaction:1831: errno=-24 unknown
[CAUSE]
The error is EMFILE (Too many files open) and comes from the anonymous
block device allocation. The ids are in a shared pool of size 1<<20.
The ids are assigned to live subvolumes, ie. the root structure exists
in memory (eg. after creation or after the root appears in some path).
The pool could be exhausted if the numbers are not reclaimed fast
enough, after subvolume deletion or if other system component uses the
anon block devices.
[WORKAROUND]
Since it's not possible to completely solve the problem, we can only
minimize the time the id is allocated to a subvolume root.
Firstly, we can reduce the use of anon\_dev by trees that are not
subvolume roots, like data reloc tree.
This patch will do extra check on root objectid, to skip roots that
don't need anon\_dev. Currently it's only data reloc tree and orphan
roots.

ARM: 8992/1: Fix unwind\_frame for clang-built kernels
commit b4d5ec9b39f8b31d98f65bc5577b5d15d93795d7 upstream.
Since clang does not push pc and sp in function prologues, the current
implementation of unwind\_frame does not work. By using the previous
frame's lr/fp instead of saved pc/sp we get valid unwinds on clang-built
kernels.
The bounds check on next frame pointer must be changed as well since
there are 8 less bytes between frames.
This fixes /proc//stack.

ALSA: usb-audio: work around streaming quirk for MacroSilicon MS2109
commit 1b7ecc241a67ad6b584e071bd791a54e0cd5f097 upstream.
Further investigation of the L-R swap problem on the MS2109 reveals that
the problem isn't that the channels are swapped, but rather that they
are swapped and also out of phase by one sample. In other words, the
issue is actually that the very first frame that comes from the hardware
is a half-frame containing only the right channel, and after that
everything becomes offset.
So introduce a new quirk field to drop the very first 2 bytes that come
in after the format is configured and a capture stream starts. This puts
the channels in phase and in the correct order.

fs/minix: reject too-large maximum file size
commit 270ef41094e9fa95273f288d7d785313ceab2ff3 upstream.
If the minix filesystem tries to map a very large logical block number to
its on-disk location, block\_to\_path() can return offsets that are too
large, causing out-of-bounds memory accesses when accessing indirect index
blocks. This should be prevented by the check against the maximum file
size, but this doesn't work because the maximum file size is read directly
from the on-disk superblock and isn't validated itself.
Fix this by validating the maximum file size at mount time.

fs/minix: check return value of sb\_getblk()
commit da27e0a0e5f655f0d58d4e153c3182bb2b290f64 upstream.
Patch series "fs/minix: fix syzbot bugs and set s\_maxbytes".
This series fixes all syzbot bugs in the minix filesystem:
KASAN: null-ptr-deref Write in get\_block
KASAN: use-after-free Write in get\_block
KASAN: use-after-free Read in get\_block
WARNING in inc\_nlink
KMSAN: uninit-value in get\_block
WARNING in drop\_nlink
It also fixes the minix filesystem to set s\_maxbytes correctly, so that
userspace sees the correct behavior when exceeding the max file size.
This patch (of 6):
sb\_getblk() can fail, so check its return value.
This fixes a NULL pointer dereference.

crypto: ccp - Fix use of merged scatterlists
commit 8a302808c60d441d9884cb00ea7f2b534f2e3ca5 upstream.
Running the crypto manager self tests with
CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_MANAGER\_EXTRA\_TESTS may result in several types of errors
when using the ccp-crypto driver:
alg: skcipher: cbc-des3-ccp encryption failed on test vector 0; expected\_error=0, actual\_error=-5 ...
alg: skcipher: ctr-aes-ccp decryption overran dst buffer on test vector 0 ...
alg: ahash: sha224-ccp test failed (wrong result) on test vector ...
These errors are the result of improper processing of scatterlists mapped
for DMA.
Given a scatterlist in which entries are merged as part of mapping the
scatterlist for DMA, the DMA length of a merged entry will reflect the
combined length of the entries that were merged. The subsequent
scatterlist entry will contain DMA information for the scatterlist entry
after the last merged entry, but the non-DMA information will be that of
the first merged entry.
The ccp driver does not take this scatterlist merging into account. To
address this, add a second scatterlist pointer to track the current
position in the DMA mapped representation of the scatterlist. Both the DMA
representation and the original representation of the scatterlist must be
tracked as while most of the driver can use just the DMA representation,
scatterlist\_map\_and\_copy() must use the original representation and
expects the scatterlist pointer to be accurate to the original
representation.
In order to properly walk the original scatterlist, the scatterlist must
be walked until the combined lengths of the entries seen is equal to the
DMA length of the current entry being processed in the DMA mapped
representation.

commit c06c76602e03bde24ee69a2022a829127e504202 upstream.
clang static analysis flags this error
qat\_uclo.c:297:3: warning: Attempt to free released memory
[unix.Malloc]
kfree(\*init\_tab\_base);
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When input \*init\_tab\_base is null, the function allocates memory for
the head of the list. When there is problem allocating other list
elements the list is unwound and freed. Then a check is made if the
list head was allocated and is also freed.
Keeping track of the what may need to be freed is the variable 'tail\_old'.
The unwinding/freeing block is
while (tail\_old) {
mem\_init = tail\_old->next;
kfree(tail\_old);
tail\_old = mem\_init;
}
The problem is that the first element of tail\_old is also what was
allocated for the list head
init\_header = kzalloc(sizeof(\*init\_header), GFP\_KERNEL);
...
\*init\_tab\_base = init\_header;
flag = 1;
}
tail\_old = init\_header;
So \*init\_tab\_base/init\_header are freed twice.
There is another problem.
When the input \*init\_tab\_base is non null the tail\_old is calculated by
traveling down the list to first non null entry.
tail\_old = init\_header;
while (tail\_old->next)
tail\_old = tail\_old->next;
When the unwinding free happens, the last entry of the input list will
be freed.
So the freeing needs a general changed.
If locally allocated the first element of tail\_old is freed, else it
is skipped. As a bit of cleanup, reset \*init\_tab\_base if it came in
as null.

drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Added needed\_headroom and a skb->len check
[ Upstream commit c7ca03c216acb14466a713fedf1b9f2c24994ef2 ]
1. Added a skb->len check
This driver expects upper layers to include a pseudo header of 1 byte
when passing down a skb for transmission. This driver will read this
1-byte header. This patch added a skb->len check before reading the
header to make sure the header exists.
2. Changed to use needed\_headroom instead of hard\_header\_len to request
necessary headroom to be allocated
In net/packet/af\_packet.c, the function packet\_snd first reserves a
headroom of length (dev->hard\_header\_len + dev->needed\_headroom).
Then if the socket is a SOCK\_DGRAM socket, it calls dev\_hard\_header,
which calls dev->header\_ops->create, to create the link layer header.
If the socket is a SOCK\_RAW socket, it "un-reserves" a headroom of
length (dev->hard\_header\_len), and assumes the user to provide the
appropriate link layer header.
So according to the logic of af\_packet.c, dev->hard\_header\_len should
be the length of the header that would be created by
dev->header\_ops->create.
However, this driver doesn't provide dev->header\_ops, so logically
dev->hard\_header\_len should be 0.
So we should use dev->needed\_headroom instead of dev->hard\_header\_len
to request necessary headroom to be allocated.
This change fixes kernel panic when this driver is used with AF\_PACKET
SOCK\_RAW sockets.

pinctrl-single: fix pcs\_parse\_pinconf() return value
[ Upstream commit f46fe79ff1b65692a65266a5bec6dbe2bf7fc70f ]
This patch causes pcs\_parse\_pinconf() to return -ENOTSUPP when no
pinctrl\_map is added. The current behavior is to return 0 when
!PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF or !nconfs. Thus pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry()
incorrectly assumes that a map was added and sets num\_maps = 2.
Analysis:
=========
The function pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() calls pcs\_parse\_pinconf()
if PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF is enabled. The function pcs\_parse\_pinconf()
returns 0 to indicate there was no error and num\_maps is then set to 2:
980 static int pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry(struct pcs\_device \*pcs,
981 struct device\_node \*np,
982 struct pinctrl\_map \*\*map,
983 unsigned \*num\_maps,
984 const char \*\*pgnames)
985 {
1053 (\*map)->type = PIN\_MAP\_TYPE\_MUX\_GROUP;
1054 (\*map)->data.mux.group = np->name;
1055 (\*map)->data.mux.function = np->name;
1056
1057 if (PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF && function) {
1058 res = pcs\_parse\_pinconf(pcs, np, function, map);
1059 if (res)
1060 goto free\_pingroups;
1061 \*num\_maps = 2;
1062 } else {
1063 \*num\_maps = 1;
1064 }
However, pcs\_parse\_pinconf() will also return 0 if !PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF or
!nconfs. I believe these conditions should indicate that no map was
added by returning -ENOTSUPP. Otherwise pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry()
will set num\_maps = 2 even though no maps were successfully added, as
it does not reach "m++" on line 940:
895 static int pcs\_parse\_pinconf(struct pcs\_device \*pcs, struct device\_node \*np,
896 struct pcs\_function \*func,
897 struct pinctrl\_map \*\*map)
898
899 {
900 struct pinctrl\_map \*m = \*map;
917 /\* If pinconf isn't supported, don't parse properties in below. \*/
918 if (!PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF)
919 return 0;
920
921 /\* cacluate how much properties are supported in current node \*/
922 for (i = 0; i < ARRAY\_SIZE(prop2); i++) {
923 if (of\_find\_property(np, prop2[i].name, NULL))
924 nconfs++;
925 }
926 for (i = 0; i < ARRAY\_SIZE(prop4); i++) {
927 if (of\_find\_property(np, prop4[i].name, NULL))
928 nconfs++;
929 }
930 if (!nconfs)
919 return 0;
932
933 func->conf = devm\_kcalloc(pcs->dev,
934 nconfs, sizeof(struct pcs\_conf\_vals),
935 GFP\_KERNEL);
936 if (!func->conf)
937 return -ENOMEM;
938 func->nconfs = nconfs;
939 conf = &(func->conf[0]);
940 m++;
This situtation will cause a boot failure [0] on the BeagleBone Black
(AM3358) when am33xx\_pinmux node in arch/arm/boot/dts/am33xx-l4.dtsi
has compatible = "pinconf-single" instead of "pinctrl-single".
The patch fixes this issue by returning -ENOSUPP when !PCS\_HAS\_PINCONF
or !nconfs, so that pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() will know that no
map was added.
Logic is also added to pcs\_parse\_one\_pinctrl\_entry() to distinguish
between -ENOSUPP and other errors. In the case of -ENOSUPP, num\_maps
is set to 1 as it is valid for pinconf to be enabled and a given pin
group to not any pinconf properties.

In theory, a panic can happen after a bus or host reset with dma\_started
flag set. Fix this by halting the DMA before reinitializing the host.
Don't assume that ms->current\_req is set when halt\_dma() is invoked as it
may not hold for bus or host reset.
BTW, this particular Conner drive can be made to work by inhibiting
disconnect/reselect with 'mesh.resel\_targets=0'.

usb: dwc2: Fix error path in gadget registration
[ Upstream commit 33a06f1300a79cfd461cea0268f05e969d4f34ec ]
When gadget registration fails, one should not call usb\_del\_gadget\_udc().
Ensure this by setting gadget->udc to NULL. Also in case of a failure
there is no need to disable low-level hardware, so return immiedetly
instead of jumping to error\_init label.
This fixes the following kernel NULL ptr dereference on gadget failure
(can be easily triggered with g\_mass\_storage without any module
parameters):

USB: serial: iuu\_phoenix: fix led-activity helpers
[ Upstream commit de37458f8c2bfc465500a1dd0d15dbe96d2a698c ]
The set-led command is eight bytes long and starts with a command byte
followed by six bytes of RGB data and ends with a byte encoding a
frequency (see iuu\_led() and iuu\_rgbf\_fill\_buffer()).
The led activity helpers had a few long-standing bugs which corrupted
the command packets by inserting a second command byte and thereby
offsetting the RGB data and dropping the frequency in non-xmas mode.
In xmas mode, a related off-by-one error left the frequency field
uninitialised.

that any kernel running on a box with more than 4096 threads (NR\_CPUS
advertises a limit of of 8192 cpus) would expose userspace to two cpu
contexts running at the same time with the same cpu number.
Note: I'm not aware of any distro shipping a kernel with support for more
than 4096 threads today, nor of any system image that currently exceeds
4096 threads. Found via code browsing.

PCI: Fix pci\_cfg\_wait queue locking problem
[ Upstream commit 2a7e32d0547f41c5ce244f84cf5d6ca7fccee7eb ]
The pci\_cfg\_wait queue is used to prevent user-space config accesses to
devices while they are recovering from reset.
Previously we used these operations on pci\_cfg\_wait:
\_\_add\_wait\_queue(&pci\_cfg\_wait, ...)
\_\_remove\_wait\_queue(&pci\_cfg\_wait, ...)
wake\_up\_all(&pci\_cfg\_wait)
The wake\_up acquires the wait queue lock, but the add and remove do not.
Originally these were all protected by the pci\_lock, but cdcb33f98244
("PCI: Avoid possible deadlock on pci\_lock and p->pi\_lock"), moved
wake\_up\_all() outside pci\_lock, so it could race with add/remove
operations, which caused occasional kernel panics, e.g., during vfio-pci
hotplug/unplug testing:
Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address ffff802dac469000
Resolve this by using wait\_event() instead of \_\_add\_wait\_queue() and
\_\_remove\_wait\_queue(). The wait queue lock is held by both wait\_event()
and wake\_up\_all(), so it provides mutual exclusion.

ACPICA: Do not increment operation\_region reference counts for field units
[ Upstream commit 6a54ebae6d047c988a31f5ac5a64ab5cf83797a2 ]
ACPICA commit e17b28cfcc31918d0db9547b6b274b09c413eb70
Object reference counts are used as a part of ACPICA's garbage
collection mechanism. This mechanism keeps track of references to
heap-allocated structures such as the ACPI operand objects.
Recent server firmware has revealed that this reference count can
overflow on large servers that declare many field units under the
same operation\_region. This occurs because each field unit declaration
will add a reference count to the source operation\_region.
This change solves the reference count overflow for operation\_regions
objects by preventing fieldunits from incrementing their
operation\_region's reference count. Each operation\_region's reference
count will not be changed by named objects declared under the Field
operator. During namespace deletion, the operation\_region namespace
node will be deleted and each fieldunit will be deleted without
touching the deleted operation\_region object.

bcache: fix super block seq numbers comparision in register\_cache\_set()
[ Upstream commit 117f636ea695270fe492d0c0c9dfadc7a662af47 ]
In register\_cache\_set(), c is pointer to struct cache\_set, and ca is
pointer to struct cache, if ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq, it means this
registering cache has up to date version and other members, the in-
memory version and other members should be updated to the newer value.
But current implementation makes a cache set only has a single cache
device, so the above assumption works well except for a special case.
The execption is when a cache device new created and both ca->sb.seq and
c->sb.seq are 0, because the super block is never flushed out yet. In
the location for the following if() check,
2156 if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq) {
2157 c->sb.version = ca->sb.version;
2158 memcpy(c->sb.set\_uuid, ca->sb.set\_uuid, 16);
2159 c->sb.flags = ca->sb.flags;
2160 c->sb.seq = ca->sb.seq;
2161 pr\_debug("set version = %llu\n", c->sb.version);
2162 }
c->sb.version is not initialized yet and valued 0. When ca->sb.seq is 0,
the if() check will fail (because both values are 0), and the cache set
version, set\_uuid, flags and seq won't be updated.
The above problem is hiden for current code, because the bucket size is
compatible among different super block version. And the next time when
running cache set again, ca->sb.seq will be larger than 0 and cache set
super block version will be updated properly.
But if the large bucket feature is enabled, sb->bucket\_size is the low
16bits of the bucket size. For a power of 2 value, when the actual
bucket size exceeds 16bit width, sb->bucket\_size will always be 0. Then
read\_super\_common() will fail because the if() check to
is\_power\_of\_2(sb->bucket\_size) is false. This is how the long time
hidden bug is triggered.
This patch modifies the if() check to the following way,
2156 if (ca->sb.seq > c->sb.seq || c->sb.seq == 0) {
Then cache set's version, set\_uuid, flags and seq will always be updated
corectly including for a new created cache device.

ddebug\_describe\_flags() currently fills a caller provided string buffer,
after testing its size (also passed) in a BUG\_ON. Fix this by
replacing them with a known-big-enough string buffer wrapped in a
struct, and passing that instead.
Also simplify ddebug\_describe\_flags() flags parameter from a struct to
a member in that struct, and hoist the member deref up to the caller.
This makes the function reusable (soon) where flags are unpacked.

On failure pcie\_capability\_read\_dword() sets it's last parameter, val
to 0. However, with Patch 14/14, it is possible that val is set to ~0 on
failure. This would introduce a bug because (x & x) == (~0 & x).
This bug can be avoided without changing the function's behaviour if the
return value of pcie\_capability\_read\_dword is checked to confirm success.
Check the return value of pcie\_capability\_read\_dword() to ensure success.

video: fbdev: neofb: fix memory leak in neo\_scan\_monitor()
[ Upstream commit edcb3895a751c762a18d25c8d9846ce9759ed7e1 ]
neofb\_probe() calls neo\_scan\_monitor() that can successfully allocate a
memory for info->monspecs.modedb and proceed to case 0x03. There it does
not free the memory and returns -1. neofb\_probe() goes to label
err\_scan\_monitor, thus, it does not free this memory through calling
fb\_destroy\_modedb() as well. We can not go to label err\_init\_hw since
neo\_scan\_monitor() can fail during memory allocation. So, the patch frees
the memory directly for case 0x03.

Avoid this by testing the channel state before calling iop\_do\_send().

the channel is idle. If iop\_send\_queue is not empty, iop\_do\_send() will

msm8916-pins.dtsi specifies "bias-pull-none" for most of the audio

where the same property was used for these audio pins.
However, "bias-pull-none" actually does not exist at all - not in
mainline and not in downstream. I can only guess that the original
intention was to configure "no pull", i.e. bias-disable.
Change it to that instead.

this function returns an error, kobject\_put() must be called to properly
clean up the memory associated with the object.

gpio: fix oops resulting from calling of\_get\_named\_gpio(NULL, ...)
This happens for the spi-imx driver when running a dt-enabled kernel on
a non-dt machine on Linux 4.0. Among the still supported stable versions
only 4.4 and 4.9 are affected. (However the spi-imx driver doesn't call
of\_get\_named\_gpio() since v4.8-rc1 (commit b36581df7e78 ("spi: imx:
Using existing properties for chipselects")) any more, but the problem
might still affect other users of of\_get\_named\_gpio().)
In 4.14-rc1 this problem is gone with
commit 7eb6ce2f2723 ("gpio: Convert to using %pOF instead of
full\_name"). This commit however doesn't seem sensible to backport as it
depends on ce4fecf1fe15 ("vsprintf: Add %p extension "%pOF" for device
tree") which doesn't trivially apply to v4.4.

tracepoint: Mark \_\_tracepoint\_string's \_\_used
commit f3751ad0116fb6881f2c3c957d66a9327f69cefb upstream.
\_\_tracepoint\_string's have their string data stored in .rodata, and an
address to that data stored in the "\_\_tracepoint\_str" section. Functions
that refer to those strings refer to the symbol of the address. Compiler
optimization can replace those address references with references
directly to the string data. If the address doesn't appear to have other
uses, then it appears dead to the compiler and is removed. This can
break the /tracing/printk\_formats sysfs node which iterates the
addresses stored in the "\_\_tracepoint\_str" section.
Like other strings stored in custom sections in this header, mark these
\_\_used to inform the compiler that there are other non-obvious users of
the address, so they should still be emitted.

Smack: fix use-after-free in smk\_write\_relabel\_self()
commit beb4ee6770a89646659e6a2178538d2b13e2654e upstream.
smk\_write\_relabel\_self() frees memory from the task's credentials with
no locking, which can easily cause a use-after-free because multiple
tasks can share the same credentials structure.
Fix this by using prepare\_creds() and commit\_creds() to correctly modify
the task's credentials.
Reproducer for "BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in smk\_write\_relabel\_self":
#include

#include

int fd = open("/sys/fs/smackfs/relabel-self", O\_WRONLY);

}

Revert "vxlan: fix tos value before xmit"
[ Upstream commit a0dced17ad9dc08b1b25e0065b54c97a318e6e8b ]
This reverts commit 71130f29979c7c7956b040673e6b9d5643003176.
In commit 71130f29979c ("vxlan: fix tos value before xmit") we want to
make sure the tos value are filtered by RT\_TOS() based on RFC1349.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| PRECEDENCE | TOS | MBZ |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
But RFC1349 has been obsoleted by RFC2474. The new DSCP field defined like
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| DS FIELD, DSCP | ECN FIELD |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
So with
IPTOS\_TOS\_MASK 0x1E
RT\_TOS(tos) ((tos)&IPTOS\_TOS\_MASK)
the first 3 bits DSCP info will get lost.
To take all the DSCP info in xmit, we should revert the patch and just push
all tos bits to ip\_tunnel\_ecn\_encap(), which will handling ECN field later.

net: lan78xx: replace bogus endpoint lookup
[ Upstream commit ea060b352654a8de1e070140d25fe1b7e4d50310 ]
Drop the bogus endpoint-lookup helper which could end up accepting
interfaces based on endpoints belonging to unrelated altsettings.
Note that the returned bulk pipes and interrupt endpoint descriptor
were never actually used. Instead the bulk-endpoint numbers are
hardcoded to 1 and 2 (matching the specification), while the interrupt-
endpoint descriptor was assumed to be the third descriptor created by
USB core.
Try to bring some order to this by dropping the bogus lookup helper and
adding the missing endpoint sanity checks while keeping the interrupt-
descriptor assumption for now.

vxlan: Ensure FDB dump is performed under RCU
[ Upstream commit b5141915b5aec3b29a63db869229e3741ebce258 ]
The commit cited below removed the RCU read-side critical section from
rtnl\_fdb\_dump() which means that the ndo\_fdb\_dump() callback is invoked
without RCU protection.
This results in the following warning [1] in the VXLAN driver, which
relied on the callback being invoked from an RCU read-side critical
section.
Fix this by calling rcu\_read\_lock() in the VXLAN driver, as already done
in the bridge driver.

ipv6: fix memory leaks on IPV6\_ADDRFORM path
[ Upstream commit 8c0de6e96c9794cb523a516c465991a70245da1c ]
IPV6\_ADDRFORM causes resource leaks when converting an IPv6 socket
to IPv4, particularly struct ipv6\_ac\_socklist. Similar to
struct ipv6\_mc\_socklist, we should just close it on this path.
This bug can be easily reproduced with the following C program:
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main()
{
int s, value;
struct sockaddr\_in6 addr;
struct ipv6\_mreq m6;
s = socket(AF\_INET6, SOCK\_DGRAM, 0);
addr.sin6\_family = AF\_INET6;
addr.sin6\_port = htons(5000);
inet\_pton(AF\_INET6, "::ffff:192.168.122.194", &addr.sin6\_addr);
connect(s, (struct sockaddr \*)&addr, sizeof(addr));
inet\_pton(AF\_INET6, "fe80::AAAA", &m6.ipv6mr\_multiaddr);
m6.ipv6mr\_interface = 5;
setsockopt(s, SOL\_IPV6, IPV6\_JOIN\_ANYCAST, &m6, sizeof(m6));
value = AF\_INET;
setsockopt(s, SOL\_IPV6, IPV6\_ADDRFORM, &value, sizeof(value));
close(s);
return 0;
}

ipv4: Silence suspicious RCU usage warning
[ Upstream commit 83f3522860f702748143e022f1a546547314c715 ]
fib\_trie\_unmerge() is called with RTNL held, but not from an RCU
read-side critical section. This leads to the following warning [1] when
the FIB alias list in a leaf is traversed with
hlist\_for\_each\_entry\_rcu().
Since the function is always called with RTNL held and since
modification of the list is protected by RTNL, simply use
hlist\_for\_each\_entry() and silence the warning.

binder: Prevent context manager from incrementing ref 0
commit 4b836a1426cb0f1ef2a6e211d7e553221594f8fc upstream.
Binder is designed such that a binder\_proc never has references to
itself. If this rule is violated, memory corruption can occur when a
process sends a transaction to itself; see e.g.
.
There is a remaining edgecase through which such a transaction-to-self
can still occur from the context of a task with BINDER\_SET\_CONTEXT\_MGR
access:
- task A opens /dev/binder twice, creating binder\_proc instances P1
and P2
- P1 becomes context manager
- P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 0 in its
handle table
- P1 dies (by closing the /dev/binder fd and waiting a bit)
- P2 becomes context manager
- P2 calls ACQUIRE on the magic handle 0, allocating index 1 in its
handle table
[this triggers a warning: "binder: 1974:1974 tried to acquire
reference to desc 0, got 1 instead"]
- task B opens /dev/binder once, creating binder\_proc instance P3
- P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) with (void\*)1 as argument (two-way
transaction)
- P2 receives the handle and uses it to call P3 (two-way transaction)
- P3 calls P2 (via magic handle 0) (two-way transaction)
- P2 calls P2 (via handle 1) (two-way transaction)
And then, if P2 does \*NOT\* accept the incoming transaction work, but
instead closes the binder fd, we get a crash.
Solve it by preventing the context manager from using ACQUIRE on ref 0.
There shouldn't be any legitimate reason for the context manager to do
that.
Additionally, print a warning if someone manages to find another way to
trigger a transaction-to-self bug in the future.

set/removexattr on an exported filesystem should break NFS delegations.
This is true in general, but also for the upcoming support for
RFC 8726 (NFSv4 extended attribute support). Make sure that they do.
Additionally, they need to grow a \_locked variant, since callers might
call this with i\_rwsem held (like the NFS server code).

atm: fix atm\_dev refcnt leaks in atmtcp\_remove\_persistent
[ Upstream commit 51875dad43b44241b46a569493f1e4bfa0386d86 ]
atmtcp\_remove\_persistent() invokes atm\_dev\_lookup(), which returns a
reference of atm\_dev with increased refcount or NULL if fails.
The refcount leaks issues occur in two error handling paths. If
dev\_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL, the function
returns 0 without decreasing the refcount kept by a local variable,
resulting in refcount leaks.
Fix the issue by adding atm\_dev\_put() before returning 0 both when
dev\_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL.

cfg80211: check vendor command doit pointer before use

In the case where a vendor command does not implement doit, and has no
flags set, doit would not be validated and a NULL pointer dereference
would occur, for example when invoking the vendor command via iw.
I encountered this while developing new vendor commands. Perhaps in
practice it is advisable to always implement doit along with dumpit,
but it seems reasonable to me to always check doit anyway, not just
when NEED\_WDEV.

vgacon\_scrollback\_update() always leaves enbough room in the scrollback
buffer for the next call, but if the console size changed that room
might not actually be enough, and so we need to re-check.
The check should be in the loop since vgacon\_scrollback\_cur->tail is
updated in the loop and count may be more than 1 when triggered by CSI M,
as Jiri's PoC:
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main(int argc, char\*\* argv)
{
int fd = open("/dev/tty1", O\_RDWR);
unsigned short size[3] = {25, 200, 0};
ioctl(fd, 0x5609, size); // VT\_RESIZE
write(fd, "\e[1;1H", 6);
for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++)
write(fd, "\e[10M", 5);
}
It leads to various crashes as vgacon\_scrollback\_update writes out of
the buffer:
BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc900001752a0
#PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
#PF: error\_code(0x0002) - not-present page

Call Trace:

Or to KASAN reports:

omapfb: dss: Fix max fclk divider for omap36xx
commit 254503a2b186caa668a188dbbd7ab0d25149c0a5 upstream.
The drm/omap driver was fixed to correct an issue where using a
divider of 32 breaks the DSS despite the TRM stating 32 is a valid
number. Through experimentation, it appears that 31 works, and
it is consistent with the value used by the drm/omap driver.
This patch fixes the divider for fbdev driver instead of the drm.

ALSA: seq: oss: Serialize ioctls
commit 80982c7e834e5d4e325b6ce33757012ecafdf0bb upstream.
Some ioctls via OSS sequencer API may race and lead to UAF when the
port create and delete are performed concurrently, as spotted by a
couple of syzkaller cases. This patch is an attempt to address it by
serializing the ioctls with the existing register\_mutex.
Basically OSS sequencer API is an obsoleted interface and was designed
without much consideration of the concurrency. There are very few
applications with it, and the concurrent performance isn't asked,
hence this "big hammer" approach should be good enough.

ext4: fix direct I/O read error
This patch is used to fix ext4 direct I/O read error when
the read size is not aligned with block size.
Then, I will use a test to explain the error.
(1) Make a file that is not aligned with block size:
$dd if=/dev/zero of=./test.jar bs=1000 count=3
(2) I wrote a source file named "direct\_io\_read\_file.c" as following:
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#define BUF\_SIZE 1024
int main()
{
int fd;
int ret;
unsigned char \*buf;
ret = posix\_memalign((void \*\*)&buf, 512, BUF\_SIZE);
if (ret) {
perror("posix\_memalign failed");
exit(1);
}
fd = open("./test.jar", O\_RDONLY | O\_DIRECT, 0755);
if (fd < 0){
perror("open ./test.jar failed");
exit(1);
}
do {
ret = read(fd, buf, BUF\_SIZE);
printf("ret=%d\n",ret);
if (ret < 0) {
perror("write test.jar failed");
}
} while (ret > 0);
free(buf);
close(fd);
}
(3) Compile the source file:
$gcc direct\_io\_read\_file.c -D\_GNU\_SOURCE
(4) Run the test program:
$./a.out
The result is as following:
ret=1024
ret=1024
ret=952
ret=-1
write test.jar failed: Invalid argument.
I have tested this program on XFS filesystem, XFS does not have
this problem, because XFS use iomap\_dio\_rw() to do direct I/O
read. And the comparing between read offset and file size is done
in iomap\_dio\_rw(), the code is as following:
if (pos < size) {
retval = filemap\_write\_and\_wait\_range(mapping, pos,
pos + iov\_length(iov, nr\_segs) - 1);
if (!retval) {
retval = mapping->a\_ops->direct\_IO(READ, iocb,
iov, pos, nr\_segs);
}
...
}
...only when "pos < size", direct I/O can be done, or 0 will be return.
I have tested the fix patch on Ext4, it is up to the mustard of
EINVAL in man2(read) as following:
#include
ssize\_t read(int fd, void \*buf, size\_t count);
EINVAL
fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for reading;
or the file was opened with the O\_DIRECT flag, and either the
address specified in buf, the value specified in count, or the
current file offset is not suitably aligned.
So I think this patch can be applied to fix ext4 direct I/O error.
However Ext4 introduces direct I/O read using iomap infrastructure
on kernel 5.5, the patch is commit
("ext4: introduce direct I/O read using iomap infrastructure"),
then Ext4 will be the same as XFS, they all use iomap\_dio\_rw() to do direct
I/O read. So this problem does not exist on kernel 5.5 for Ext4.
>From above description, we can see this problem exists on all the kernel
versions between kernel 3.14 and kernel 5.4. It will cause the Applications
to fail to read. For example, when the search service downloads a new full
index file, the search engine is loading the previous index file and is
processing the search request, it can not use buffer io that may squeeze
the previous index file in use from pagecache, so the serch service must
use direct I/O read.
Please apply this patch on these kernel versions, or please use the method
on kernel 5.5 to fix this problem.

random32: move the pseudo-random 32-bit definitions to prandom.h
commit c0842fbc1b18c7a044e6ff3e8fa78bfa822c7d1a upstream.
The addition of percpu.h to the list of includes in random.h revealed
some circular dependencies on arm64 and possibly other platforms. This
include was added solely for the pseudo-random definitions, which have
nothing to do with the rest of the definitions in this file but are
still there for legacy reasons.
This patch moves the pseudo-random parts to linux/prandom.h and the
percpu.h include with it, which is now guarded by \_LINUX\_PRANDOM\_H and
protected against recursive inclusion.
A further cleanup step would be to remove this from
entirely, and make people who use the prandom infrastructure include
just the new header file. That's a bit of a churn patch, but grepping
for "prandom\_" and "next\_pseudo\_random32" "struct rnd\_state" should
catch most users.
But it turns out that that nice cleanup step is fairly painful, because
a \_lot\_ of code currently seems to depend on the implicit include of
, which can currently come in a lot of ways, including
such fairly core headfers as .
So the "nice cleanup" part may or may never happen.

random32: remove net\_rand\_state from the latent entropy gcc plugin

This is probably a trivial fix for the latent\_entropy plugin, but for
now, just remove net\_rand\_state from the list of things the plugin

random: fix circular include dependency on arm64 after addition of percpu.h
commit 1c9df907da83812e4f33b59d3d142c864d9da57f upstream.
Daniel Díaz and Kees Cook independently reported that commit
f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt and
activity") broke arm64 due to a circular dependency on include files
since the addition of percpu.h in random.h.
The correct fix would definitely be to move all the prandom32 stuff out
of random.h but for backporting, a smaller solution is preferred.
This one replaces linux/percpu.h with asm/percpu.h, and this fixes the
problem on x86\_64, arm64, arm, and mips. Note that moving percpu.h
around didn't change anything and that removing it entirely broke
differently. When backporting, such options might still be considered
if this patch fails to help.
[ It turns out that an alternate fix seems to be to just remove the
troublesome  remove from the arm64
that causes the circular dependency.
But we might as well do the whole belt-and-suspenders thing, and
minimize inclusion in  too. Either will fix the
problem, and both are good changes. - Linus ]

random32: update the net random state on interrupt and activity
commit f227e3ec3b5cad859ad15666874405e8c1bbc1d4 upstream.
This modifies the first 32 bits out of the 128 bits of a random CPU's
net\_rand\_state on interrupt or CPU activity to complicate remote
observations that could lead to guessing the network RNG's internal
state.
Note that depending on some network devices' interrupt rate moderation
or binding, this re-seeding might happen on every packet or even almost
never.
In addition, with NOHZ some CPUs might not even get timer interrupts,
leaving their local state rarely updated, while they are running
networked processes making use of the random state. For this reason, we
also perform this update in update\_process\_times() in order to at least
update the state when there is user or system activity, since it's the
only case we care about.

x86/i8259: Use printk\_deferred() to prevent deadlock
commit bdd65589593edd79b6a12ce86b3b7a7c6dae5208 upstream.
0day reported a possible circular locking dependency:
Chain exists of:
&irq\_desc\_lock\_class --> console\_owner --> &port\_lock\_key
Possible unsafe locking scenario:
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
lock(&port\_lock\_key);
lock(console\_owner);
lock(&port\_lock\_key);
lock(&irq\_desc\_lock\_class);
The reason for this is a printk() in the i8259 interrupt chip driver
which is invoked with the irq descriptor lock held, which reverses the
lock operations vs. printk() from arbitrary contexts.
Switch the printk() to printk\_deferred() to avoid that.

xen-netfront: fix potential deadlock in xennet\_remove()
[ Upstream commit c2c633106453611be07821f53dff9e93a9d1c3f0 ]
There's a potential race in xennet\_remove(); this is what the driver is
doing upon unregistering a network device:
1. state = read bus state
2. if state is not "Closed":
3. request to set state to "Closing"
4. wait for state to be set to "Closing"
5. request to set state to "Closed"
6. wait for state to be set to "Closed"
If the state changes to "Closed" immediately after step 1 we are stuck
forever in step 4, because the state will never go back from "Closed" to
"Closing".
Make sure to check also for state == "Closed" in step 4 to prevent the
deadlock.
Also add a 5 sec timeout any time we wait for the bus state to change,
to avoid getting stuck forever in wait\_event().

Revert "i2c: cadence: Fix the hold bit setting"
[ Upstream commit 0db9254d6b896b587759e2c844c277fb1a6da5b9 ]
This reverts commit d358def706880defa4c9e87381c5bf086a97d5f9.
There are two issues with "i2c: cadence: Fix the hold bit setting" commit.
1. In case of combined message request from user space, when the HOLD
bit is cleared in cdns\_i2c\_mrecv function, a STOP condition is sent
on the bus even before the last message is started. This is because when
the HOLD bit is cleared, the FIFOS are empty and there is no pending
transfer. The STOP condition should occur only after the last message
is completed.
2. The code added by the commit is redundant. Driver is handling the
setting/clearing of HOLD bit in right way before the commit.
The setting of HOLD bit based on 'bus\_hold\_flag' is taken care in
cdns\_i2c\_master\_xfer function even before cdns\_i2c\_msend/cdns\_i2c\_recv
functions.
The clearing of HOLD bit is taken care at the end of cdns\_i2c\_msend and
cdns\_i2c\_recv functions based on bus\_hold\_flag and byte count.
Since clearing of HOLD bit is done after the slave address is written to
the register (writing to address register triggers the message transfer),
it is ensured that STOP condition occurs at the right time after
completion of the pending transfer (last message).

net: ethernet: ravb: exit if re-initialization fails in tx timeout

According to the report of [1], this driver is possible to cause
the following error in ravb\_tx\_timeout\_work().
ravb e6800000.ethernet ethernet: failed to switch device to config mode
This error means that the hardware could not change the state
from "Operation" to "Configuration" while some tx and/or rx queue
are operating. After that, ravb\_config() in ravb\_dmac\_init() will fail,
and then any descriptors will be not allocaled anymore so that NULL
pointer dereference happens after that on ravb\_start\_xmit().
To fix the issue, the ravb\_tx\_timeout\_work() should check
the return values of ravb\_stop\_dma() and ravb\_dmac\_init().
If ravb\_stop\_dma() fails, ravb\_tx\_timeout\_work() re-enables TX and RX
and just exits. If ravb\_dmac\_init() fails, just exits.

usb: hso: Fix debug compile warning on sparc32

On sparc32, tcflag\_t is "unsigned long", unlike on all other

As "unsigned long" is 32-bit on sparc32, fix this by casting all tcflag\_t
parameters to "unsigned int".
While at it, use "%u" to format unsigned numbers.

mlxsw: core: Free EMAD transactions using kfree\_rcu()
[ Upstream commit 3c8ce24b037648a5a15b85888b259a74b05ff97d ]
The lifetime of EMAD transactions (i.e., 'struct mlxsw\_reg\_trans') is
managed using RCU. They are freed using kfree\_rcu() once the transaction
ends.
However, in case the transaction failed it is freed immediately after being
removed from the active transactions list. This is problematic because it is
still possible for a different CPU to dereference the transaction from an RCU
read-side critical section while traversing the active transaction list in
mlxsw\_emad\_rx\_listener\_func(). In which case, a use-after-free is triggered
[1].
Fix this by freeing the transaction after a grace period by calling
kfree\_rcu().

commit 4becb7ee5b3d2829ed7b9261a245a77d5b7de902 upstream.
x25\_connect() invokes x25\_get\_neigh(), which returns a reference of the
specified x25\_neigh object to "x25->neighbour" with increased refcnt.
When x25 connect success and returns, the reference still be hold by
"x25->neighbour", so the refcount should be decreased in
x25\_disconnect() to keep refcount balanced.
The reference counting issue happens in x25\_disconnect(), which forgets
to decrease the refcnt increased by x25\_get\_neigh() in x25\_connect(),
causing a refcnt leak.
Fix this issue by calling x25\_neigh\_put() before x25\_disconnect()
returns.

xfs: fix missed wakeup on l\_flush\_wait
commit cdea5459ce263fbc963657a7736762ae897a8ae6 upstream.
The code in xlog\_wait uses the spinlock to make adding the task to
the wait queue, and setting the task state to UNINTERRUPTIBLE atomic
with respect to the waker.
Doing the wakeup after releasing the spinlock opens up the following
race condition:
Task 1 task 2
add task to wait queue
wake up task
set task state to UNINTERRUPTIBLE
This issue was found through code inspection as a result of kworkers
being observed stuck in UNINTERRUPTIBLE state with an empty
wait queue. It is rare and largely unreproducable.
Simply moving the spin\_unlock to after the wake\_up\_all results
in the waker not being able to see a task on the waitqueue before
it has set its state to UNINTERRUPTIBLE.
This bug dates back to the conversion of this code to generic
waitqueue infrastructure from a counting semaphore back in 2008
which didn't place the wakeups consistently w.r.t. to the relevant
spin locks.
[dchinner: Also fix a similar issue in the shutdown path on
xc\_commit\_wait. Update commit log with more details of the issue.]

commit bbc8a99e952226c585ac17477a85ef1194501762 upstream.
rds\_notify\_queue\_get() is potentially copying uninitialized kernel stack
memory to userspace since the compiler may leave a 4-byte hole at the end
of `cmsg`.
In 2016 we tried to fix this issue by doing `= { 0 };` on `cmsg`, which
unfortunately does not always initialize that 4-byte hole. Fix it by using
memset() instead.

fbdev: Detect integer underflow at "struct fbcon\_ops"->clear\_margins.
[ Upstream commit 033724d6864245a11f8e04c066002e6ad22b3fd0 ]
syzbot is reporting general protection fault in bitfill\_aligned() [1]
caused by integer underflow in bit\_clear\_margins(). The cause of this
problem is when and how do\_vc\_resize() updates vc->vc\_{cols,rows}.
If vc\_do\_resize() fails (e.g. kzalloc() fails) when var.xres or var.yres
is going to shrink, vc->vc\_{cols,rows} will not be updated. This allows
bit\_clear\_margins() to see info->var.xres < (vc->vc\_cols \* cw) or
info->var.yres < (vc->vc\_rows \* ch). Unexpectedly large rw or bh will
try to overrun the \_\_iomem region and causes general protection fault.
Also, vc\_resize(vc, 0, 0) does not set vc->vc\_{cols,rows} = 0 due to
new\_cols = (cols ? cols : vc->vc\_cols);
new\_rows = (lines ? lines : vc->vc\_rows);
exception. Since cols and lines are calculated as
cols = FBCON\_SWAP(ops->rotate, info->var.xres, info->var.yres);
rows = FBCON\_SWAP(ops->rotate, info->var.yres, info->var.xres);
cols /= vc->vc\_font.width;
rows /= vc->vc\_font.height;
vc\_resize(vc, cols, rows);
in fbcon\_modechanged(), var.xres < vc->vc\_font.width makes cols = 0
and var.yres < vc->vc\_font.height makes rows = 0. This means that
const int fd = open("/dev/fb0", O\_ACCMODE);
struct fb\_var\_screeninfo var = { };
ioctl(fd, FBIOGET\_VSCREENINFO, &var);
var.xres = var.yres = 1;
ioctl(fd, FBIOPUT\_VSCREENINFO, &var);
easily reproduces integer underflow bug explained above.
Of course, callers of vc\_resize() are not handling vc\_do\_resize() failure
is bad. But we can't avoid vc\_resize(vc, 0, 0) which returns 0. Therefore,
as a band-aid workaround, this patch checks integer underflow in
"struct fbcon\_ops"->clear\_margins call, assuming that
vc->vc\_cols \* vc->vc\_font.width and vc->vc\_rows \* vc->vc\_font.heigh do not
cause integer overflow.

x86, vmlinux.lds: Page-align end of ..page\_aligned sections
[ Upstream commit de2b41be8fcccb2f5b6c480d35df590476344201 ]
On x86-32 the idt\_table with 256 entries needs only 2048 bytes. It is
page-aligned, but the end of the .bss..page\_aligned section is not
guaranteed to be page-aligned.
As a result, objects from other .bss sections may end up on the same 4k
page as the idt\_table, and will accidentially get mapped read-only during
boot, causing unexpected page-faults when the kernel writes to them.
This could be worked around by making the objects in the page aligned
sections page sized, but that's wrong.
Explicit sections which store only page aligned objects have an implicit
guarantee that the object is alone in the page in which it is placed. That
works for all objects except the last one. That's inconsistent.
Enforcing page sized objects for these sections would wreckage memory
sanitizers, because the object becomes artificially larger than it should
be and out of bound access becomes legit.
Align the end of the .bss..page\_aligned and .data..page\_aligned section on
page-size so all objects places in these sections are guaranteed to have
their own page.

x86/build/lto: Fix truncated .bss with -fdata-sections
[ Upstream commit 6a03469a1edc94da52b65478f1e00837add869a3 ]
With CONFIG\_LD\_DEAD\_CODE\_DATA\_ELIMINATION=y, we compile the kernel with
-fdata-sections, which also splits the .bss section.
The new section, with a new .bss.\* name, which pattern gets missed by the
main x86 linker script which only expects the '.bss' name. This results
in the discarding of the second part and a too small, truncated .bss
section and an unhappy, non-working kernel.
Use the common BSS\_MAIN macro in the linker script to properly capture
and merge all the generated BSS sections.

p9\_read\_work would try to handle an errored req even if it got put to
error state by another thread between the lookup (that worked) and the
time it had been fully read.
The request itself is safe to use because we hold a ref to it from the
lookup (for m->rreq, so it was safe to read into the request data buffer
until this point), but the req\_list has been deleted at the same time
status changed, and client\_cb already has been called as well, so we
should not do either.

drm/amdgpu: Prevent kernel-infoleak in amdgpu\_info\_ioctl()
commit 543e8669ed9bfb30545fd52bc0e047ca4df7fb31 upstream.
Compiler leaves a 4-byte hole near the end of `dev\_info`, causing
amdgpu\_info\_ioctl() to copy uninitialized kernel stack memory to userspace
when `size` is greater than 356.
In 2015 we tried to fix this issue by doing `= {};` on `dev\_info`, which
unfortunately does not initialize that 4-byte hole. Fix it by using
memset() instead.

ARM: 8986/1: hw\_breakpoint: Don't invoke overflow handler on uaccess watchpoints
commit eec13b42d41b0f3339dcf0c4da43734427c68620 upstream.
Unprivileged memory accesses generated by the so-called "translated"
instructions (e.g. LDRT) in kernel mode can cause user watchpoints to fire
unexpectedly. In such cases, the hw\_breakpoint logic will invoke the user
overflow handler which will typically raise a SIGTRAP back to the current
task. This is futile when returning back to the kernel because (a) the
signal won't have been delivered and (b) userspace can't handle the thing
anyway.
Avoid invoking the user overflow handler for watchpoints triggered by
kernel uaccess routines, and instead single-step over the faulting
instruction as we would if no overflow handler had been installed.

PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on ASMedia ASM1083/1085 PCIe-to-PCI bridge
commit b361663c5a40c8bc758b7f7f2239f7a192180e7c upstream.
Recently ASPM handling was changed to allow ASPM on PCIe-to-PCI/PCI-X
bridges. Unfortunately the ASMedia ASM1083/1085 PCIe to PCI bridge device
doesn't seem to function properly with ASPM enabled. On an Asus PRIME
H270-PRO motherboard, it causes errors like these:
pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Data Link Layer, (Transmitter ID)
pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: device [8086:a292] error status/mask=00003000/00002000
pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: [12] Timeout
pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: Corrected error received: 0000:00:1c.0
pcieport 0000:00:1c.0: AER: can't find device of ID00e0
In addition to flooding the kernel log, this also causes the machine to
wake up immediately after suspend is initiated.
The device advertises ASPM L0s and L1 support in the Link Capabilities
register, but the ASMedia web page for ASM1083 [1] claims "No PCIe ASPM
support".
Windows 10 (build 2004) enables L0s, but it also logs correctable PCIe
errors.
Add a quirk to disable ASPM for this device.

xfs: don't call xfs\_da\_shrink\_inode with NULL bp
[ Upstream commit bb3d48dcf86a97dc25fe9fc2c11938e19cb4399a ]
xfs\_attr3\_leaf\_create may have errored out before instantiating a buffer,
for example if the blkno is out of range. In that case there is no work
to do to remove it, and in fact xfs\_da\_shrink\_inode will lead to an oops
if we try.
This also seems to fix a flaw where the original error from
xfs\_attr3\_leaf\_create gets overwritten in the cleanup case, and it
removes a pointless assignment to bp which isn't used after this.

xfs: validate cached inodes are free when allocated

A recent fuzzed filesystem image cached random dcache corruption
when the reproducer was run. This often showed up as panics in

but had many different failure modes including deadlocks trying to
lock the inode that was just allocated or KASAN reports of
use-after-free violations.
The cause of the problem was a corrupt INOBT on a v4 fs where the
root inode was marked as free in the inobt record. Hence when we
allocated an inode, it chose the root inode to allocate, found it in
the cache and re-initialised it.
We recently fixed a similar inode allocation issue caused by inobt
record corruption problem in xfs\_iget\_cache\_miss() in commit
ee457001ed6c ("xfs: catch inode allocation state mismatch
corruption"). This change adds similar checks to the cache-hit path
to catch it, and turns the reproducer into a corruption shutdown
situation.

xfs: catch inode allocation state mismatch corruption
[ Upstream commit ee457001ed6c6f31ddad69c24c1da8f377d8472d ]
We recently came across a V4 filesystem causing memory corruption
due to a newly allocated inode being setup twice and being added to
the superblock inode list twice. From code inspection, the only way
this could happen is if a newly allocated inode was not marked as
free on disk (i.e. di\_mode wasn't zero).
Running the metadump on an upstream debug kernel fails during inode
allocation like so:

Extracting the inode number we crashed on from an event trace and

core.magic = 0x494e
core.mode = 0100644
core.version = 2

.....
Confirms that it is not a free inode on disk. xfs\_repair
also trips over this inode:
.....
zero length extent (off = 0, fsbno = 0) in ino 184452204
correcting nextents for inode 184452204
bad attribute fork in inode 184452204, would clear attr fork

would have cleared inode 184452204
.....
disconnected inode 184452204, would move to lost+found
And so we have a situation where the directory structure and the
inobt thinks the inode is free, but the inode on disk thinks it is
still in use. Where this corruption came from is not possible to
diagnose, but we can detect it and prevent the kernel from oopsing
on lookup. The reproducer now results in:
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/scratch/{0,1,2,3,4,5}{0,1,2,3,4,5}

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-9445

    A potential out-of-bounds read was discovered in the F2FS
    implementation.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could potentially use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or to read sensitive information.

CVE-2019-19073, CVE-2019-19074

    Navid Emamdoost discovered potential memory leaks in the ath9k and
    ath9k_htc drivers.  The security impact of these is unclear.

CVE-2019-19448

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free, and could be triggered by crafted filesystem
    images.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12351

    Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in
    the way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled.  A remote attacker
    within a short distance, knowing the victim's Bluetooth device
    address, can send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of
    service or possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel
    privileges.

CVE-2020-12352

    Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation.
    Stack memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP
    packets.  A remote attacker within a short distance, knowing the
    victim's Bluetooth device address address, can retrieve kernel
    stack information.

CVE-2020-12655

    Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system
    hang.  An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-12771

    Zhiqiang Liu reported a bug in the bcache block driver that could
    lead to a system hang.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-12888

    It was discovered that the PCIe Virtual Function I/O (vfio-pci)
    driver allowed users to disable a device's memory space while it
    was still mapped into a process.  On some hardware platforms,
    local users or guest virtual machines permitted to access PCIe
    Virtual Functions could use this to cause a denial of service
    (hardware error and crash).

CVE-2020-14305

    Vasily Averin of Virtuozzo discovered a potential heap buffer
    overflow in the netfilter nf_contrack_h323 module.  When this
    module is used to perform connection tracking for TCP/IPv6, a
    remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code execution with
    kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-14314

    A bug was discovered in the ext4 filesystem that could lead to an
    out-of-bound read.  A local user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2020-14331

    A bug was discovered in the VGA console driver's soft-scrollback
    feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On a system
    with a custom kernel that has CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK
    enabled, a local user with access to a console could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14356, CVE-2020-25220

    A bug was discovered in the cgroup subsystem's handling of socket
    references to cgroups.  In some cgroup configurations, this could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user might be able to use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

    The original fix for this bug introudced a new security issue,
    which is also addressed in this update.

CVE-2020-14386

    Or Cohen discovered a bug in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  A
    local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14390

    Minh Yuan discovered a bug in the framebuffer console driver's
    scrollback feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On
    a system using framebuffer consoles, a local user with access to a
    console could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    The scrollback feature has been disabled for now, as no other fix
    was available for this issue.

CVE-2020-15393

    Kyungtae Kim reported a memory leak in the usbtest driver.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-16166

    Amit Klein reported that the random number generator used by the
    network stack might not be re-seeded for long periods of time,
    making e.g. client port number allocations more predictable.  This
    made it easier for remote attackers to carry out some network-
    based attacks such as DNS cache poisoning or device tracking.

CVE-2020-24490

    Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation that
    can lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On systems with a Bluetooth 5
    hardware interface, a remote attacker within a short distance can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for remote code execution with kernel privilege.

CVE-2020-25211

    A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem.  A local attacker
    able to inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2020-25212

    A bug was discovered in the NFSv4 client implementation that could
    lead to a heap buffer overflow.  A malicious NFS server could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute arbitrary code on the client.

CVE-2020-25284

    It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver allowed
    tasks running as uid 0 to add and remove rbd devices, even if they
    dropped capabilities.  On a system with the rbd driver loaded,
    this might allow privilege escalation from a container with a task
    running as root.

CVE-2020-25285

    A race condition was discovered in the hugetlb filesystem's sysctl
    handlers, that could lead to stack corruption.  A local user
    permitted to write to hugepages sysctls could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  By default only the root user can do this.

CVE-2020-25641

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the block layer that could lead to
    an infinite loop.  A local user with access to a raw block device
    could use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU use and
    possible system hang).

CVE-2020-25643

    ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the
    hdlc_ppp module.  Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr()
    function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.

CVE-2020-26088

    It was discovered that the NFC (Near Field Communication) socket
    implementation allowed any user to create raw sockets.  On a
    system with an NFC interface, this allowed local users to evade
    local network security policy.
