Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in the "Admin-Tools" feature of BlackCat CMS 1.3.6. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving and displaying data related to "BlackCat CMS Output Filters" and "Droplets" in the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The CMS attempts to remove script tags, but this is insufficient. It does not perform proper HTML entity encoding of user-provided input before reflecting it back to the page.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious script payload is saved in the database and executed whenever the affected admin tool page is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the website or displaying malicious content.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information available to the administrator within the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves an authenticated user accessing the Admin-Tools section.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable areas are related to the "BlackCat CMS Output Filters" and "Droplets" configuration settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with access to the BlackCat CMS admin panel.
*   The attacker must be able to navigate to the `BlackCatCMS/backend/admintools/index.php` and subsequent tool pages (e.g., `tool.php?tool=blackcatFilter` or `tool.php?tool=droplets`).
*   The attacker must be able to input malicious JavaScript payloads into the fields associated with these tools.

**Technical Details**

The attacker injects malicious payloads like:
*   `'><details/open/ontoggle=confirm(1337)>`
*   `">< img src=xx onerror=alert(1) >`

These payloads are stored and then executed when an administrator visits the affected admin tools pages, demonstrating a Stored XSS vulnerability.

The issue was reported against version 1.3.6 of BlackCat CMS, and is targeted to be resolved in version 1.4.
