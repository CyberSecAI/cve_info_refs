  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sort_rrset()` function within dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled. The vulnerability occurs when sorting resource records, due to missing length checks when handling the RDLENGTH field of DNS replies, allowing an attacker to control the size of data being copied into a buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Missing length checks",
	  "Insufficient validation of DNS replies"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a buffer overflow with arbitrary data in a heap-allocated memory, potentially leading to remote code execution on the vulnerable machine. Other impacts include denial of service and cache poisoning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
	  "Attacker-controlled DNS server",
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to forge DNS replies",
      "Knowledge of DNS protocol",
      "Ability to inject packets into the network"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the DNSSEC validation process, specifically when sorting Resource Records Sets (RRSets). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS response to a vulnerable dnsmasq server. This crafted DNS response manipulates the RDLENGTH field, causing a heap-based buffer overflow when the `memcpy` function copies data without proper bounds checking."
