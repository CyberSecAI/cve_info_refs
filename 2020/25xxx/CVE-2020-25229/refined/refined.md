- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The implemented encryption for communication with affected devices is prone to replay attacks due to the usage of a static key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Usage of a hard-coded cryptographic key. The encryption is vulnerable to replay attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could change the password or change the configuration on any affected device if using prepared messages that were generated for another device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access. An attacker can capture network traffic and generate valid commands for other devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic and be able to generate prepared messages.
