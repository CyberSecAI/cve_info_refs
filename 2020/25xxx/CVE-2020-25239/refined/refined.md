- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The webserver allows unauthorized actions via special URLs for unprivileged users. Specifically, the settings of the UMC authorization server could be changed by an attacker with unprivileged user rights, potentially adding a rogue server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization (CWE-863). Unprivileged users can access functionality they should not have access to through specially crafted URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change UMC authorization server settings by adding a rogue server. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access and potentially further compromise the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network access (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid unprivileged user account (PR:L) and no user interaction is required (UI:N).
