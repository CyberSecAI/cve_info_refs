Datadog Application Security Management allows you to manage application security risk with continuous, real-time monitoring of vulnerabilities and threats against your web applications, serverless applications, and APIs in production. Automatically integrated with APM distributed traces and code-level context, Application Security Management empowers development, operations, and security teams to build and run secure applications in production.

---

## Detect and defend against attacks

* Understand how ongoing threats targeting your web and serverless applications are propagating through your service chain with end-to-end attack flows
* Pivot to errors, associated stack traces, and logs to easily collaborate across teams and eliminate bottlenecks
* Slow down attackers by blocking suspicious requests or bad actors directly through the Datadog platform

---

## Automatically discover your API attack surface

* Gain visibility into the performance, security, and ownership of all your API endpoints in a single view
* Surface the most targeted and at-risk endpoints to prioritize remediation efforts
* Protect API endpoints by automatically blocking specific IPs, users, or requests

---

## Continuously monitor for code-level vulnerabilities in production

* Continuously identify vulnerabilities in application code serving production-level traffic, without the overhead of code scans or time-consuming testing processes
* Identify the specific input or request that triggered the vulnerability in order to accelerate triage
* Immediately see the exact vulnerable file, version, and line of code to reduce mean time to remediation

---

## Focus on open source vulnerabilities which present active risk

* Get end-to-end visibility into vulnerable open source libraries loaded across the CI and production
* Prioritize open source library vulnerabilities in your code and at runtime with Datadogâ€™s Severity Score, which factors in exposure, CVSS, and real-time threat activity
* Ensure remediated vulnerabilities make it to production and avoid discrepancies between static and runtime code due to errors in the CI/CD pipeline

Application Security Management was simple to enable and further configure to meet our needs. Additionally, with vulnerability detection and contextualized severity ratings, we can better prioritize our remediation efforts within our service layers.![Micha Katz](https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/products/asm/micha_katz-2.png?ch=Width,DPR,Save-Data&fm=png&auto=format&fit=max&mask=ellipse&auto=compress&w=50&h=50)Micha Katz
