Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `scanServer64` module of Trend Micro Apex One. This inadequate validation allows for a read operation to occur beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected system.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code with SYSTEM privileges. This means the initial information disclosure can be a stepping stone to achieving more significant control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*  **User-Supplied Data:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing maliciously crafted user supplied data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must first gain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Trend Micro Apex One is installed.

**Additional Details:**

*   Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on May 13, 2020, and the advisory was publicly released on September 25, 2020.
