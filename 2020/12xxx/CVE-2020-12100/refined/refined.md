```
1.  **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   **CVE-2020-12100:** Dovecot incorrectly handles deeply nested MIME parts.
    *   **CVE-2020-12673:** Dovecot's NTLM implementation does not correctly check message buffer size.
    *  **CVE-2020-12674:** The Dovecot RPA mechanism incorrectly handles zero-length messages.

2.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **CVE-2020-12100:** Uncontrolled recursion when parsing nested MIME parts leading to resource exhaustion.
    *   **CVE-2020-12673:** Improper message buffer size check leading to out-of-bounds read.
     *  **CVE-2020-12674:** Incorrect handling of zero-length messages in RPA mechanism leading to crash.

3.  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **CVE-2020-12100:** A remote attacker can cause Dovecot to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
    *   **CVE-2020-12673:** A remote attacker can cause Dovecot to crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
    *  **CVE-2020-12674:** A remote attacker can cause Dovecot to crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS).

4.  **Attack vectors:**
    *   **CVE-2020-12100:** Sending a specially crafted email with deeply nested MIME parts.
    *   **CVE-2020-12673:** Sending a specially crafted NTLM authentication message.
    *   **CVE-2020-12674:** Sending a specially crafted RPA authentication message.

5.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **CVE-2020-12100:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable Dovecot server.
    *   **CVE-2020-12673:** The attacker needs to be able to send NTLM authentication messages to the vulnerable Dovecot server.
    *   **CVE-2020-12674:** The attacker needs to be able to send RPA authentication messages to the vulnerable Dovecot server.
