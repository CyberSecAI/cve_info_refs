Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-12026:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the `ViewSrv.dll` component. Specifically, it involves a flaw in the implementation of IOCTL 0x0000277d.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The vulnerability allows for relative path traversal, which enables an attacker to access or manipulate files outside of the application's intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **File Overwrite:**  A low-privilege user can overwrite files outside of the applicationâ€™s control.
*   **Compromise System Availability:** Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of system availability.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Code execution occurs within the context of the Administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service and does not require prior authentication.
*   The attacker must send a specially crafted path, which is not properly sanitized.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Advantech WebAccess/SCADA, specifically in the ViewSrv.dll component when handling IOCTL 0x0000277d.
*   The vulnerability allows a low privilege user to overwrite files.
*   Advantech has released updates to address the issue.

This analysis provides more details than the original CVE description, including the specific IOCTL involved and the DLL affected. It also highlights the critical nature of the vulnerability (remote code execution without authentication).
