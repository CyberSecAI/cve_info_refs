This content is related to the "iframe" WordPress plugin and includes several code changes related to security fixes for XSS vulnerabilities. Although not directly specified, this information is relevant for CVE-2020-12696 as it is a cross-site scripting vulnerability and the changelog includes XSS fixes.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the improper sanitization and handling of user-supplied attributes within the `iframe` shortcode. Specifically, the plugin was vulnerable to XSS due to the use of unsafe attributes like `onload`, `onmouseover`, `onfocus`, `onpageshow`, `onclick`, and the `srcdoc` attribute. These attributes can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code when rendered in the iframe tag.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unsanitized `srcdoc` attribute: Allowing user-provided content in this attribute could lead to the execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
- Unsafe event handler attributes (`onload`, `onmouseover`, `onfocus`, `onpageshow`, `onclick`): These could execute malicious JavaScript.
- `get_params_from_url` parameter: This parameter was vulnerable to XSS due to improper URL handling.
- Insecure handling of various other parameters.

Impact of exploitation:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the iframes, potentially leading to:
   - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Defacing the website.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

Attack vectors:
- Injecting malicious attributes via the `iframe` shortcode within posts or pages.
- Crafting malicious URLs that, when processed, could lead to script execution.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to create or modify content on a WordPress site that utilizes the vulnerable plugin. This could be through a compromised administrator or editor account, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to insert malicious code into the website.
