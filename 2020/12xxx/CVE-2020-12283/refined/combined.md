# GHSL-2020-085: Open redirect vulnerability in Sourcegraph - CVE-2020-12283

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125701)
Alvaro Munoz](https://github.com/pwntester)

## Summary

An open redirect vulnerability has been found on Sourcegraph due to improper validation in the `SafeRedirectURL` method, as a consequence an attacker could potentially redirect a victim to any arbitrary URL and access their OAUTH token.

## Product

Sourcegraph

## CVE

CVE-2020-12283

## Tested Version

Tested on [master](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) branch up to afcd7cf010d2508bfb8393fcf9c4497dc0099180

## Details

An open redirect is a security vulnerability in which a website endpoint accepts a URL as input and and then redirects to the user-provided URL. This type of vulnerability can be used for e.g. phishing attacks in which an attacker abuses the trust relationship a victim has with the redirecting site to redirect to a malicious site.
A more serious attack may occur when an application implements an oauth flow. In this scenario an attacker can abuse e.g. external service authentication (think “Login with Facebook/Google/GitHub/etc”) to redirect users to an attacker controlled site, where they will then steal the partial oauth token.

A good example of this type of vulnerability can be found in this [OAuth2 advisory](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-qqxw-m5fj-f7gv)

`SafeRedirectURL` relies on `url.Parse` and `u.Path` to extract the relative path. `SafeRedirectURL` will transform any absolute URLs starting with `//` into `/` and any absolute URLs starting with `/\\` will be URL encoded into `/%5C`. However, when `url.Parse` parses the URL it will NOT normalize double slashes (e.g: `u.Path` will return `//bar` for `http://foo.com//bar`). An attacker can abuse this behavior by crafting an URL like `//foo//example.com` so that `u.Path` will return `//example.com` which, when sent to the browser, will make it visit the absolute URL `http://example.com`.

```
func SafeRedirectURL(urlStr string) string {
        u, err := url.Parse(urlStr)
        if err != nil || !strings.HasPrefix(u.Path, "/") {
                return "/"
        }

```

The vulnerability was found using the following [CodeQL](https://codeql.com) query:

```
/**
 * @name Open redirect due to sanitzation bypass
 * @kind path-problem
 * @problem.severity medium
 * @id go/example/hasprefix
 */

import go
import DataFlow::PathGraph

 predicate prefixCheck(StringOps::HasPrefix call, DataFlow::Node checked, Variable v, string prefix) {
   checked = call.getBaseString() and
   prefix = call.getSubstring().getStringValue() and
   v.getARead() = checked
 }

predicate insuffcientPrefixCheck(StringOps::HasPrefix call, DataFlow::Node checked, Variable v) {
    prefixCheck(call, checked, v, "/")  and
    (not prefixCheck(_, _, v, "//") or not prefixCheck(_, _, v, "/\\"))

}

class BadRedirectConfig extends TaintTracking::Configuration {
  BadRedirectConfig() { this = "BadRedirectConfig" }
  override predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node source) {
    source instanceof UntrustedFlowSource
  }
  override predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node sink) {
        insuffcientPrefixCheck(_, sink, _)
  }
}

from DataFlow::PathNode source, DataFlow::PathNode sink, BadRedirectConfig cfg
where cfg.hasFlowPath(source, sink)
select sink, source, sink, "Bad redirect check on untrusted data from $@", source, "this source"

```
### Impact

The full impact of this vulnerability depends on the context of use. While open redirect issues can aid phishing attacks, it also seems that `SafeRedirectURL` is used in Sourcegraph’s OAuth flow which may lead to token hijacks.

### Remediation

The vulnerability has been fixed in Sourcegraph v3.14.4 and v3.15.1

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
