Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-12283:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `SafeRedirectURL` method of the Sourcegraph application. This method attempts to sanitize URLs to prevent open redirects but fails to properly handle URLs with double slashes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient URL sanitization:** The `SafeRedirectURL` method uses `url.Parse` and `u.Path` to extract the relative path. While it attempts to transform absolute URLs starting with `//` into `/` and encodes `/\\`, it doesn't normalize double slashes.
- **Bypassable validation:** The `url.Parse` function does not normalize double slashes, allowing an attacker to craft a URL like `//foo//example.com`. When parsed by the vulnerable method, `u.Path` returns `//example.com`, which when sent to the browser, makes it visit the absolute URL `http://example.com`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Open redirect:** An attacker can redirect victims to an arbitrary URL. This can be used for phishing attacks by misleading users into trusting the redirecting site to land on a malicious site.
- **OAuth token hijacking:** The `SafeRedirectURL` method is used in Sourcegraph's OAuth flow. An attacker can redirect users to an attacker-controlled site during the OAuth process, potentially stealing partial OAuth tokens.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Manipulated URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing double slashes and provides it as input to the vulnerable endpoint. This could be through a hyperlink or parameter that is parsed by `SafeRedirectURL`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL that is processed by the `SafeRedirectURL` function, by tricking a user to click a malicious link or by other means of manipulating URL parameters used by the Sourcegraph application.
- The attacker needs no special access to the server or application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found using a CodeQL query to identify insufficient prefix checks for URLs.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Sourcegraph versions v3.14.4 and v3.15.1.
