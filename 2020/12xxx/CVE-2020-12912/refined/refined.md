The provided content contains information about CVE-2020-12912.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is related to the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface on x86 processors.
- Researchers demonstrated the use of a differential power analysis method via the Linux-based RAPL interface to conduct side-channel attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The RAPL interface, when not properly restricted, allows access to power consumption data that can be used in side-channel attacks.
- The original implementation of RAPL did not require privileged access, allowing unprivileged users to potentially extract sensitive information through power analysis.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Potential information leakage via side-channel attacks.
- Ability to extract sensitive data by analyzing power consumption patterns.

**Attack vectors:**

- Software-based power side-channel attacks through the RAPL interface.
- An attacker could utilize the RAPL interface to monitor power consumption data and infer sensitive information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Ability to execute code on the target system.
- Access to the RAPL interface, which initially was not restricted to privileged users.
- Knowledge of power analysis techniques to interpret the power consumption data and extract sensitive information.

**Mitigation:**

- AMD updated the RAPL interface to require privileged access, preventing unprivileged users from directly accessing the power data, thus mitigating the side-channel attack.
- This change is being integrated into Linux distributions.
