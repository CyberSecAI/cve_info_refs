Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-12516

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption in the Web-Based Management (WBM) interface of WAGO programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Specifically, the issue stems from the processing of maliciously constructed packets sent to the HTTP(S) ports (80/443).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400): The device fails to properly manage the resources when processing certain network requests, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the device to crash by sending a series of malicious packets to the HTTP/HTTPS ports. The device requires a power cycle to return to normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious packets over the network to the affected device's HTTP(S) ports (80/443).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
- No special skills are required; it is considered low skill level to exploit.
- No authentication is needed (attack can be launched remotely without credentials)

**Affected Products (Firmware versions prior to FW11):**

* 750-352
* 750-831/xxx-xxx
* 750-852
* 750-880/xxx-xxx
* 750-881
* 750-889
* 750-331/xxx-xxx
* 750-829
* 750-882
* 750-885

**Mitigations:**
- Update to the latest firmware (FW14 is specifically recommended).
- Restrict network access to the device.
- Do not directly connect the device to the Internet.
- Disable unused TCP/UDP ports.
- Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls.
- When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to WAGO by William Knowles (Applied Risk).
- CERT@VDE also published an advisory and coordinated with WAGO.
- No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability, however the attack is considered low skill.
- The affected devices are used in critical infrastructure sectors such as Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Transportation Systems.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5
