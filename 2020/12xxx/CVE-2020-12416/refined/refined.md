  "CVE-2020-12416": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition between `VideoStreamEncoder` being freed and `VideoBroadcaster::AddOrUpdateSink` attempting to use it.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potentially exploitable crash, arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to induce the race condition through network communication with the affected browser, which requires user interaction."
  },
  "CVE-2020-12415": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application cache implementation does not properly handle URL encoded forward slashes (`%2F`) in the manifest URL, leading to incorrect directory resolution and fallback resource loading.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect path canonicalization"
    ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "The application cache may load resources from an incorrect location, possibly leading to arbitrary resource loading.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must control a web server serving an application manifest that contains `%2F` in the URL, and be able to get a victim to load the application."
  },
   "CVE-2020-12417": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Confusion over the handling of ValueTags on JavaScript objects, specifically on ARM64 platforms. Due to a missing sign extension, an object could pass type checks incorrectly resulting in memory corruption.",
