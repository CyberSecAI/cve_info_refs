- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of Phoenix Contact PLCnext Control Devices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated low-privileged user can embed malicious JavaScript code. When an administrator visits the vulnerable website, the injected code can execute with the administrator's privileges, leading to local privilege escalation. This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with low-privileged access needs to inject malicious javascript code into the web interface. The attack requires the administrator to visit a vulnerable webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an authenticated low-privileged account on the affected device. They also need to be able to trick an administrator into accessing the page with the malicious JavaScript code.
