# eWeLink mobile Application - Incorrect Access Control Vulnerability (CVE-2020-12702)

Weak encryption in the Quick Pairing mode in the eWeLink mobile application (Android application V4.9.2 and earlier, iOS application V4.9.1 and earlier) allows physically proximate attackers to eavesdrop on Wi-Fi credentials and other sensitive information by monitoring the Wi-Fi spectrum during the pairing process.

# Vulnerability Exploitation Script

eWeLinkESPT is a python3 script that exploits the CVE-2020-12702 vulnerability. eWeLinkESPT automatically decodes and decrypts the WiFi network credentials transmitted by the *eWeLink* mobile application during a *Quick Pairing* association process. In particular, this tool reverses the *eWeLink* implementation of the *ESP Touch* protocol, which is used by-default in the WiFi pairing of the ITEAD SONOFF devices, and many other ESP-based IoT appliances.

### Requirements

```
python3, tshark, pyshark
```

### Use

Run in a terminal:

```
$ sudo ./eWeLinkESPT.py
```

then lauch a "Quick Pairing" association through the eWeLink mobile application.

### Todo List

* Loop cyclically over all the WiFi channels
* Improve code styling

# Tested Versions

This tool has been tested with the Android (v4.9.2 and ealier) and iOS (v4.9.1 and earlier) versions of the *eWeLink* mobile application.

# Disclosure Timeline

* Feb 02, 2020: Report submitted to Coolkit, the company behind eWeLink.
* May 05, 2020: No acknowledge received, second report submitted to Coolkit.
* May 09, 2020: Received acknowledge from Coolkit CTO, stating that they were deprecating the ESP Touch pairing.
* Nov 09, 2020: Disclosing the vulnerability @CpsIoTSec2020 Conference [1]
* Feb 23, 2021: The protocol is still supported, publishing the CVE-2020-12702 ref.

## Abstract

The number of IoT devices designed and marketed in these last years is continuously growing. These smart things are more often managed through the cloud, therefore more and more devices are connected both to the customer's local networks and to the Internet. Among the several network pairing mechanisms designed for the IoT domain, we examined the Smart Config family of protocols, a clever technology that allows an IoT device to be associated with an existing WiFi network by receiving special packets from an already network-paired smartphone. We investigate the threats and the technical details behind the ESP Touch protocol, a Smart Config implementation developed by Espressif Systems for its ESP32/8266 family of chips. Additionally, we present a security analysis of the same protocol implemented by the ITEAD Sonoff smart switches (and also by many other ESP-based devices), that we conducted by reverse-engineering the eWeLink mobile companion application. In conclusion, we describe a vulnerability (published as CVE-2020-12702) we found in the Quick Pairing mode of the eWeLink SDK that leads to a full WiFi credential disclosure during the device pairing process.

June 6, 2020Excellent app. Very useful. I've 2 feature requests: 1. Please increase the length of inching time. 60 minutes isn't enough in some cases. 2. Can you include more logic in the scenes please? For example, if I turn on a light, I would like it to stay on until I decide to turn it off. But if that light is turned on as part of a scene, I'd like it to turn off after x amount of time.5 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EGemoI2NTXmTsBVtJqk8jxF9rh8ApRWfsIMQSt2uE4OcpQqbFu7f7NbTK05lx80nuSijCz7sc3a277R67g=s32-rw)A Google user*more\_vert*

January 8, 2020This is a superb app. Far superior to other IoT control apps I have used. It offers timers, looping, inching (turning off after a set interval - very useful), but allows local control when your internet link is down. It has got better with every iteration. It even allows you to download power consumption data when used with a device that monitors power. The issue with needing a 2.4GHz WiFi network is a device imposed issue rather than an app issue. A great app, but there is still room for improvement. Initial pairing can sometimes be difficult - it would be helpful to get more feedback during the process. The app is a bit clunky in appearance - lots of screen space for each device. I have a lot of devices and it takes a long time to scroll through them. I also look forward to the time when historical temperature data is available from devices like the Sonoff TH16. Despite the room for improvement, this is still a five-star app, especially because it is constantly being improved.14 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0IVo7an33FWcFfCQgD3HX5b_Cpzh4vs1joIJVocI6n_rquaM=s32-rw)Dan Baronetti*more\_vert*

March 14, 2022So many problems with every step of the set up. Put device in pairing mode and the app can't find the device. Why can't you just tap your phone to connect to it like most other smart tech. This is outdated technology. Then to connect to Google the instructions are download Google home... And then?? This is not a Google product. What next?7 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
