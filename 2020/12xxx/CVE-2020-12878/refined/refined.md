Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12878:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a local privilege escalation vulnerability stemming from the ConnectPort X2e device performing filesystem actions as the privileged `root` user on files controllable by the less-privileged `python` user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Handling:** The device's `/etc/init.d/S50dropbear.sh` script uses `chown` to change the ownership of the `/WEB/python/.ssh/` directory. Since the `python` user has write access to this directory, it can be manipulated to escalate privileges.
*   **Unnecessary Privileges:** The `root` user is executing a script (`/etc/init.d/S50dropbear.sh`) that operates on user-controlled files, which is not a secure practice.
*   **Use of Symbolic Links:** The vulnerability can be exploited by using symbolic links to redirect the `chown` command to modify critical system directories such as `/etc/init.d/`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local `python` user can escalate to `root` privileges.
*   **Remote Compromise:** An attacker with remote network access to the X2e could fully compromise the device.
*   **Malware Installation and System Modification:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to install malware, modify system behavior, or use the device as a staging point for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access via `python` user:** Attackers must be able to read and write files as the `python` user.
*   **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** Attackers create symbolic links in `/WEB/python/.ssh/`  to manipulate the `chown` command executed by root.
*   **Malicious init script:** Attackers create a malicious script in `/etc/init.d/` which is executed by root on future system boots.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires remote network access to the X2e device.
*   **Low-Privilege Access:** Initially, the attacker needs access to the device as the low-privileged `python` user which can be done via SSH or TTY access.
*  **File System Manipulation:** Ability to create and manipulate symbolic links and files.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Exploitation Method:** The exploit involves manipulating symbolic links to change the ownership of `/etc/init.d/` to the `python` user. This enables the creation of a malicious init script that executes with `root` privileges upon reboot.
*   **Affected Devices:** Digi International ConnectPort X2e devices are vulnerable.
*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability is fixed in Digi International's ConnectPort X2e software version 3.2.30.6 (May 2020).
* **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Jake Valletta and Sam Sabetan from FireEye Mandiant.
* **Disclosure Timeline**: The report includes the detailed timeline from initial report to public advisory.
