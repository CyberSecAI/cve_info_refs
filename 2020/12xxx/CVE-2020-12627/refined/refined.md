Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12627:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded session key within the Calibre-Web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Secret Key:** The application used a static, hardcoded secret key for session management. This is a critical security flaw because anyone who knows this key can forge valid user sessions.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the hardcoded key, an attacker could potentially bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded secret key could gain unauthorized access to the Calibre-Web application.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could create valid session cookies, impersonate legitimate users, and perform actions as those users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Knowledge of Hardcoded Key:** The primary attack vector is having access to the hardcoded session key. This could be through decompiling the application, obtaining it from a public source, or other means.
- **Forged Session Cookies:** Once the key is known, it can be used to generate valid session cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Hardcoded Key:** The attacker needs to obtain the hardcoded session key.
- **Ability to Generate Session Cookies:** They need to use the key to generate valid session cookies.
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to interact with the Calibre-Web application and inject the forged cookies.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by generating a random session key on startup and using the environment variable `SECRET_KEY` as an alternative, allowing users to set their own key. This fix was implemented in version 0.6.7 of Calibre-Web.
- The pull request ([#1337](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/pull/1337)) provides context around the fix.
