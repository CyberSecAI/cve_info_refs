  "summary": "The provided content describes CVE-2020-12458, which is an information disclosure vulnerability in Grafana due to world-readable database files. The vulnerability allows a local attacker to access sensitive information like cleartext or encrypted datasource passwords.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is incorrect file permissions for the Grafana database file (`grafana.db`) and the directory containing it (`/var/lib/grafana`). These files were set as world-readable, contrary to the intended restricted access, allowing any local user to read them.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect file permissions",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can access sensitive information stored in the Grafana database, such as cleartext or encrypted datasource passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to other systems or accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the server where Grafana is installed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with regular user privileges on the system running Grafana.",
    "additional_details": "The issue was initially reported in Grafana version 4.2.0 and the fix involves changing the file permissions of `/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db` to 640 and the directory `/var/lib/grafana` to 750.  Additionally, ownership of the database file was changed to `grafana:grafana`.\n\nThis vulnerability affects various NetApp products that incorporate Grafana, but the provided advisory indicates that none of their products were directly affected, although they use Grafana. Several Red Hat products also had vulnerable versions of Grafana. OpenShift and OpenShift ServiceMesh were also identified as having the vulnerability, but due to running inside a container with SELinux MCS labels the severity is lessened as the containers block external access to the files.
