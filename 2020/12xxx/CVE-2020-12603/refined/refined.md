Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Envoy handles HTTP/2 requests or responses with numerous small chunks (e.g., 1 byte). For each data frame written to the output buffer, Envoy allocates a separate buffer fragment, which is rounded up to the nearest 4KB. This behavior leads to excessive memory allocation when processing requests/responses with many small chunks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The core vulnerability is the uncontrolled allocation of memory, which can exceed configured buffer limits by one to two orders of magnitude.
- **Inefficient Memory Allocation:** Allocating a 4KB buffer for each small chunk is highly inefficient, leading to significant memory overhead.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service by sending HTTP/2 requests or responses with a large number of small chunks, leading to excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing the Envoy proxy.
- **Resource Exhaustion (Memory):** The primary impact is the exhaustion of memory resources on the server running Envoy, which can lead to instability and service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely by sending specially crafted HTTP/2 requests or responses with many small data chunks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests or responses to an Envoy proxy.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the size and number of data chunks in the HTTP/2 stream.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects Envoy versions 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4, and older.
- Patched versions are 1.14.3, 1.13.3, and 1.12.5.
- The vulnerability can occur if the peer is slow or unable to read proxied data, exacerbating the memory allocation issue.
- The content indicates the vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
