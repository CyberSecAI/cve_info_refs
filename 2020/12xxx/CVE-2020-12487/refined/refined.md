The provided content is related to the CVE-2020-12487.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by flaws in the verification of input parameters within the ABE service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the insufficient validation of input parameters, which allows for command injection. This leads to the ability to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute commands with root privileges. The impact is rated as High with High Confidentiality and Integrity impact but no Availability impact.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is physical (AV:P), meaning the attacker needs to have physical access to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have physical access to the device (AV:P) and requires user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. No specific privileges are required (PR:N) before the exploit, but the attacker needs to make the service execute crafted commands through the vulnerable interface.

The vulnerability allows for a privilege escalation due to commands being executed with root privileges once the vulnerability is triggered.
