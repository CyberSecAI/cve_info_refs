Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-12261

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of default error templates within the CodeIgniter framework used by Open-AudIT. These templates were not properly sanitizing user-supplied input, specifically the error message, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script into error pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the browser of a user visiting a vulnerable page. This can lead to:
  - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to impersonate a legitimate user.
  - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information visible within the user's browser session.
  - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or forcing them to download harmful files.
  - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the search parameter, which will be reflected in the error page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Open-AudIT application to trigger the vulnerability on the "/search/" page.
- **Knowledge of the application:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the malicious URL to inject the XSS payload.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable URL is `http://<server>/open-audit/index.php/search/`
- The exploit payload is injected after `/search/` e.g.,  `http://<server>/open-audit/index.php/search/<svg><animate onend=alert(1) attributeName=x dur=1s>`
- The vulnerability exists in Open-AudIT version 3.3.0.
- The vulnerability was resolved in version 3.3.1 by using `htmlentities` to sanitize error messages.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also includes details about rate limiting controls and account lockouts, which are not directly related to the XSS vulnerability but are security features in Open-AudIT.
- The community pages from Opmantek also highlight the fix in the release notes for version 3.3.1 stating, "Use htmlentities on all default error templates for $message. Resolve XSS issue. CVE-2020-12261".
