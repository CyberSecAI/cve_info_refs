##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Errata - 3.3.0 XSS in error templates

* ![](/wiki/aa-avatar/62abcb15979e6e0069071297)Mark Unwin
Owned by [Mark Unwin](/wiki/people/62abcb15979e6e0069071297?ref=confluence&src=profilecard)Apr 16, 2020Loading data...

It has been reported (thanks to Kamaljeet Kumar Sharma) that the default error templates in the used framework (in our case, CodeIgniter) are subject to XSS attacks.

We have now edited these templates to use htmlentities for output, even though this will make the output look 'ugly' and print, instead of use for formatting, the HTML codes.

We feel this sacrifice is required to eliminate the further possibility of additional XSS vulnerabilities where an error is caused.

You can update your four error templates if this is a large concern for you.

The files are on github at <https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/tree/master/code_igniter/application/errors>

| Configuration Change Detection and Reporting   Open-AudIT can tell you what changed, what was added or removed and when it occurred. Open-AudIT has a powerful change detection engine. Any device attributes that are added, removed or changed will be detected and stored. These changes can be reported upon and the relevant data confirmed as to what was expected from your company change and release process. |  |  |  |
| Custom Fields   If you have a particular attribute you need to record, easily add it to the database and use it to report or even group devices. Open-AudIT can store information in custom fields that are associated with each device. Once a Field has been created it can be used in queries and groups just like any other attribute in the database. |  |  |  |
| Interactive Dashboards   Open-AudIT Professional and Enterprises’ interactive Dashboard provides a single point of access to audit status and results. Simple, intuitive, dynamic – just some of the words used to describe Open-AudIT Enterprises’ interactive dashboard.

Simply Select which types of devices you want to be exported, which queries to run, and the format you want. Export to CSV and analyze offline, or import into your favorite third party data visualizer. The power is in your hands with Open-AudIT Enterprise Enhanced Reporting. |  |  |  |
| Baselines for device comparison   Baselines is a lightweight compliance tool that checks if your devices meet your standards by comparing software, users, and netstat data. With Baselines, you can define a standard configuration and see if your devices align. For example, if you have a CentOS 6 server set up perfectly for Apache, Baselines helps you ensure other servers in the cluster match that configuration. Create and schedule Baselines to run on device groups, with results that can be viewed or exported. |  |  |  |
| Cloud Discovery and Audit   With the introduction of the Clouds feature, you can supply details of your cloud, Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure, and Open-AudIT will use the relevant API to retrieve a list of locations, networks, and instances, then discover each of these instances. Full cloud auditing with all the details from a regular Open-AudIT audit and details such as the machine type and size. Once you have your cloud credentials, it is merely a matter of creating a new cloud and running the discovery – or scheduling first/future discoveries. Make sure you also have the credentials required to log on to your cloud machines, and it is all done for you just like a regular discovery. Clouds are a feature available to Open-AudIT Enterprise licensed customers. |  |  |  |
| Configurable Role Based Access Control (RBAC)   Open-AudIT Enterprise includes User Roles, offering full role-based access control (RBAC) for precise user management. Roles dictate what users can do within Open-AudIT. Default roles—admin, org\_admin, reporter, and user—come with specific permissions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each endpoint. Open-AudIT Enterprise allows you to create custom roles and modify existing ones. Roles can also integrate with LDAP (Active Directory and OpenLDAP), enabling Enterprise installations to customize the LDAP group for each role. |  |  |  |
| RBAC for Active Directory and openLDAP   Open-AudIT Enterprise offers full role-based access control (RBAC) with User Roles, enabling precise control over each user’s actions. Roles are the key to authorization in Open-AudIT. Default roles—admin, org\_admin, reporter, and user—come with specific permissions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each endpoint. Open-AudIT Enterprise also lets you create and modify custom roles. User Roles can integrate with LDAP (Active Directory and OpenLDAP), allowing Enterprise installations to customize LDAP groups for each role. |  |  |  |
| Customisable Scanning Options per Discovery   When a discovery is run, the relevant discovery scan option is chosen and those settings used by Nmap to scan the target devices. If no option set is chosen, the default configuration item (discovery\_default\_scan\_option) is selected and used. If a device is individually discovered using the “Discover Device” link on the device details page, we first check if this device has been discovered previously (by Discovery) and if so, use the discovery options from that scan. If it has not been previously discovered, we revert to the configuration item discovery\_default\_scan\_option the settings. |  |  |  |
| File Auditing & Monitoring   Open-AudIT Enterprise includes Files, providing change control monitoring of individual files and folders on both Linux and Windows servers. Get the complete Open-AudIT Enterprise experience. Audit your computers and ensure any changed files are recorded. Open-AudIT can retrieve details about a file or directory of files and monitor these files for changes as per other attributes in the Open-AudIT database. Details such as name, directory, size, hash, last changed and permissions are all recorded. This feature works on both Windows and Linux target machines. This is ideal for monitoring configuration files in /etc on Linux machines (for example). |  |  |  |
| Rack Management and Reporting   A rack is a collection of devices assigned specific positions and heights within the rack. You can associate a device with a picture, either from the provided set or custom to your environment. Our system for organizing racks is highly detailed. At the top level is the Organization (Org), which can have multiple locations. With the Racks feature, each location can contain one or more buildings, each building can have multiple floors, each floor can have multiple rooms, and each room can have multiple rows. When you create a new location, its sub-components are automatically generated. You can add more buildings, rooms, or other elements as needed. Additionally, racks can be grouped into "pods," using the pod attribute as a tag rather than following the strict hierarchical model of buildings, floors, etc. Racks are available to Open-AudIT Enterprise licensed customers. |  |  |  |
| Commercial Support   Exceptional support from FirstWave. Our team is dedicated to delivering a no-excuses, can-do approach every day. Your complete satisfaction is our top priority; anything less is unacceptable. Open-AudIT is backed by FirstWave with unparalleled support. Prefer community-driven assistance? We've got that too. Where else can you connect directly with the developers and get a response within 24 hours? We provide outstanding support, no exceptions, no compromises. Great support. Period. |  |  |  |

How it Works

Open-AudIT is a tool that offers detailed information about the devices on your network, including their configurations and any changes that occur. It is designed to be installed on a server (Windows or Linux) and used to scan your networks for devices. When a device is found, Open-AudIT runs a series of commands on it and saves the resulting data in a database. This data can be used for various reporting purposes. Open-AudIT comes with a set of over 50 reports, and users can also create custom reports as needed.

Open-AudIT uses an agentless framework to audit your network on your schedule without impacting user experience. The device discovery engine scans your network and intelligently stores the configurations of every discovered component. This provides information such as hardware details, software licensing, configuration changes, non-authorized devices, capacity utilization, and hardware warranty status.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Professional | Bug | All | Fix Javascript error on AJAX request display on update. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Use mariadb-server in dependency list for Ubuntu 20.04 instead of mysql-server. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Centos 8, add new package names in installer. |
| Community | Bug | Help | Improve m\_helper for OS Timezone for Redhat derived distro's so as to silence the PHP error for file does not exist. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Account for multiple spaces in config item for discovery\_exclude\_ip. |
| Community | Bug | Discoveries | Ensure we use the config item discovery\_exclude\_ip when executing discoveries (as well as the discovery specific exclude\_ip attribute). |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Improve logging for all\_ip\_list and responding\_ip\_list functions. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Use htmlentities on all default error templates for $message. Resolve XSS issue. CVE-2020-12261 |
| Community | Improvement | Search | Only accept POST for /search. Do not try to find the ID of a search using the name. |
| Community | Bug | All | Fix test in insert\_collection for an attribute value. Test using isset, not \!empty because a value of 0 is being replaced with an empty value, hence when the database accepts it, it is using the column default, not 0. Found in tasks with minute and hour at 0, being inserted and ending up with a value of \*. |
| Community | Bug | Database | Fix links from database lists to database table. |
| Community | Improvement | Logs | Revise logging to set failed and successful logon attempts at level 5. |
