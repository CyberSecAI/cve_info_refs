## REVIEWS(64)

Some words from real customers.

> #### Top forms module
>
> It's a very versatile module that covers all your site's possible needs with forms—suggested!

> #### Look No Further!
>
> Not only does the developer offer excellent support but this is hands down the best solution available for creating powerful forms for your site, with little effort. It is one of the primary ways we get most all our front end customer communications done. Rock solid!

> #### Simple yet powerful
>
> Installation is easy, just a few command lines and we're ready to go.

> #### Great product
>
> This is bar none the best forms solution for Magento available. The developer provides timely and excellent support when needed.

> #### Awesome Forms, Flexibility and Support
>
> The forms are absolutely beautiful!

> #### Perfect
>
> I used M1 extension about 7 years ago (at least) and it was already pretty cool but now this extension is absolutely fantastic.
>
> So far I was able to implement complex forms fitting exactly my customer's needs without having to override or extend a single line of code which was unlikely at the beginning. Although a cool feature would be conditional logic on submit buttons (as you sometimes need a different submit text depending on what have been chosen before) but other than that this is perfect.

> #### Perfect Extension & Service is too good
>

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### How does your license work?

The license allows activation of the plugin within **one** production Magento instance
with multiple store views.

The license can be freely deactivated and moved to another Magento instance if
needed.

##### Is the extension lifetime usage or do I need to pay the regular fee (aka subscription) to use it?

The plugin you purchase is for lifetime usage but the access to technical support and updates is limited
to one year. So in case you need to get the extension update or require technical support after a year you will need to
prolong the license.

##### Can I use the plugin in the development environment?

You can activate the purchased license in the development/staging environment and then move the
license to the production environment by deactivating it in the admin panel and re-activating it in the new instance.

Please contact us if you require additional development licenses.

##### Can I transfer the license to my clients account?

Yes, you can do that by contacting us.

##### Do you offer customizations for your modules?

No, we don't offer customizations for our modules but you can submit the feature request
and it will be reviewed by our team.

##### Am I able to customize your extensions?

Yes, you can customize our plugins to your needs. All our plugins come in 100% open code.

##### Is it possible to change the license from Community to Enterprise / Cloud?

You can change the license from Community to Enterprise / Cloud by paying the difference cost.
Please contact us for details.

##### What happens after the free support period has ended?

You won't have access to product updates after the support period is ended and we won't be able to provide you with technical
support.

You can extend your support period by paying the discounted product price.

##### What if the plugin doesn't work for me?

You can request the refund within 30 days after the initial purchase. Please find more details
