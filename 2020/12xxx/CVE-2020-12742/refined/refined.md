Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-12742:

**1. Verification:**

   - The commit message in the Github content "fix pecl security bug onto the test script" and the code diff directly relate to a security issue, and mention of a security fix for a vulnerability.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied URLs in the `test.php` script. Specifically, the code was attempting to filter URLs using `filter_var` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_URL`, but this was not applied consistently, and was also applied after a check for "http" instead of before.

   - **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of consistent and proper input sanitization, leading to a potential bypass if a URL does not start with "http". The original code used `filter_var` *after* checking for `http`, instead of filtering the input first.

   - **Impact:** The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly stated, but unsanitized user-provided URLs can lead to various security issues, most likely an open redirect. A malicious actor could craft a URL that, when processed, redirects the user to a malicious website. This could be used for phishing attacks or to deliver malware.

   - **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a user submitting a crafted URL via the `$_POST['url']` parameter in a request to `test.php`.

   - **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need the ability to make POST requests to the `test.php` file and the knowledge to construct a malicious URL to exploit the vulnerability.

**3. Code Diff Analysis:**

   - The provided code diff highlights the fix applied to `test.php`:
     ```diff

      <?php
      if ( ! empty( $_POST['url'] ) )
      $url = filter_var( $_POST['url'], FILTER_SANITIZE_URL );
     -if (substr($_POST['url'], 0, 4) == "http") {
     +if (substr($_POST['url'], 0, 4) == "http") {
      $url = filter_var( $_POST['url'], FILTER_SANITIZE_URL );
      }
      else
      $url = '';
     ```
    - The problematic check with `substr($_POST['url'], 0, 4) == "http"` was redundant, as filter_var was called afterwards. The fix was to not call filter_var conditionally based on a substring check.

**4. Additional Notes:**
    - The commit message indicates this fix is related to a "pecl security bug," which suggests the vulnerability might be related to PHP's PECL extensions or a similar issue reported externally.
    - The comment "Credit for reporting: Julian Horoszkiewicz (ATOS CERT)" indicates that a third party discovered and reported this security issue.

**Summary:**

The provided content reveals a vulnerability in a `test.php` script due to inconsistent URL sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by submitting a specially crafted URL that doesn't begin with "http", causing redirection to a malicious website. The fix addresses this by ensuring that the URL is consistently sanitized with `filter_var` before any further checks. The issue was reported by a third party (Julian Horoszkiewicz).
