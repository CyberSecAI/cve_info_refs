Security Update LEPTON 4.6.0.

Thanks to Ngo Van Thien, Sun\* Inc (https://sun-asterisk.vn/) we have been able to close some important issues preventing xss attacks.

All LEPTON releases are affected, so urgent update is required!

Due to massive core changes in 4.5.0 including also new Backend Theme Talgos there had been several small bugs in LEPTON 4.5.0. Therefore it is for sure a good idea to release a maintaining update. This release will be the base to upgrade to upcoming LEPTON 5.0.0.

You should read the list of deprecated functions/methods/files [in the docs](https://doc.lepton-cms.org/docu/english/core/removed-functions.php).

If you use deprecated functions/methods/files please rework your addons to make them run with upcoming LEPTON releases!

What is done in LEPTON 4.6.0?

Here is a (non-complete) list of changes, see [changelog](https://lepton-cms.org/media/changelog/changelog_4.6.0.txt) for all changes and details:

* some security bugfixes in core, search and wysiwyg
* updated a lot of libs and modules for small bugs (see details in the changelog or on the forum):

+ updated cookie
+ updated and extended lib\_lepton
+ updated lib\_search
+ updated news
+ updated tinymce to current release
+ updated wysiwyg\_admin

* some bugfixes in LEPSem and Talgos backend themes
* bugfix filemanager upload with php 7.4.x
* some bugfixes in framework
* extend class LEPTON\_request to enable secure saving of html

Version 4.6.0 stable is available on [Downloadpage](https://lepton-cms.org/english/download/stable.php) and also a [mobile Version](https://lepton-cms.org/english/download/mobile.php) can be downloaded.

Upgrade to [LEPTON 4.6.0 is possible](https://lepton-cms.org/english/download/updates/from-6.0.0-to-7.0.0.php) .
