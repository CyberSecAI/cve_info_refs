### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

**4.2.1 [USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**

Sigma Spectrum Infusion System Version(s) 6.x (model 35700BAX) and Baxter Spectrum Infusion System Version(s) 8.x (model 35700BAX2) contain hard-coded passwords which, when physically entered on the keypad, provide access to biomedical menus that include device settings, view of calibration values, and network configuration of the Sigma Spectrum Wireless Battery Module (WBM) if installed.

[CVE-2020-12039](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12039) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)).

**4.2.2 [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)**

Sigma Spectrum Infusion System Version(s) 6.x (model 35700BAX) and Baxter Spectrum Infusion System Version(s) 8.x (model 35700BAX2) at the application layer uses an unauthenticated clear-text communication channel to send and receive system status and operational data. This could allow an attacker that has circumvented network security measures to view sensitive non-private data or to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

[CVE-2020-12040](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12040) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)).

**4.2.3 [USE OF HARD CODED PASSWORD CWE-259](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**

**--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 6 ---------**

The Baxter Spectrum WBM (v9, v11, v13, v14, v15, v16, v16D38, v17, v17D19, v20D29 to v20D32, and v22D19 to v22D28) operates a Telnet service with hard-coded credentials when connected to specific SSIDs.

**--------- End Update B Part 2 of 6 ---------**

[CVE-2020-12045](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12045) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)).

**4.2.4 [INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)**

**--------- Begin Update B Part 3 of 6 ---------**

The Baxter Spectrum WBM (v9, v11, v13, v14, v15, v16, v16D38, v17, v17D19, v20D29 to v20D32, and v22D19 to v22D28) Telnet Command-Line Interface grants access to sensitive data stored on the WBM that permits temporary configuration changes to network settings of the WBM. This access allows the WBM to be rebooted. Temporary configuration changes to network settings are removed upon reboot.

**--------- End Update B Part 3 of 6 ---------**

[CVE-2020-12041](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12041) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)).

**4.2.5 [USE OF HARD-CODED PASSWORD CWE-259](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**

**--------- Begin Update B Part 4 of 6 ---------**

The factor-default wireless configuration of the Baxter Spectrum WBM (v17, v17D19, v20D29 to v20D32, and v22D19 to v22D28) enables File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service with hard-coded credentials.

**--------- End Update B Part 4 of 6 ---------**

[CVE-2020-12047](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12047) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)).

**4.2.6 [OPERATION ON A RESOURCE AFTER EXPIRATION OR RELEASE CWE-672](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/672.html)**

**--------- Begin Update B Part 5 of 6 ---------**

When configured for wireless networking, the Baxter Spectrum WBM (v17, v17D19, v20D29 to v20D32, and v22D19 to v22D28) enables FTP service operating on the WBM to remain operational until the WBM is rebooted.

**--------- End Update B Part 5 of 6 ---------**

[CVE-2020-12043](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12043) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Healthcare and Public Health
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** United States
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Baxter Healthcare has reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Baxter recommends ensuring appropriate physical controls within user environments to protect against unauthorized access to devices.

Baxter recommends isolating the Spectrum Infusion Systems to its own network VLAN to segregate the system from other hospital systems, and reduce the probability that a threat actor could execute an adjacent attack such as a MiTM attack against the system to observe clear-text communications.

**--------- Begin Update B Part 6 of 6 ---------**

Baxter recommends using the strongest available wireless network security protocols (e.g., WPA2, EAP-TLS, etc.) to provide authentication and encryption of wireless data sent to and from the Spectrum Infusion System.

**--------- End Update B Part 6 of 6 ---------**

Users should ensure the WBM is rebooted after configuration for their network(s) by removing the WBM from the rear of the Spectrum device for 10-15 seconds, and then re-attaching the WBM.

Users should always monitor for and/or block unexpected traffic, such as FTP, at network boundaries into the Spectrum-specific VLAN.

As a last resort, users may disable wireless operation of the pump. The Spectrum Infusion System was designed to operate without network access. This action would impact an organization’s ability to rapidly deploy drug library (formulary) updates to their pumps.

For additional information please see the [Baxter Product Security Bulletin](https://www.baxter.com/product-security#additionalresources).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
