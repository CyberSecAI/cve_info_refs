## CVE-2020-12655

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how the XFS filesystem handles crafted volumes. Specifically, crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system hang due to issues in metadata processing during sync operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper handling of crafted XFS volumes, which can result in a system hang.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker is able to cause a denial of service by forcing a system hang.

**Attack vectors:** Mounting a specially crafted XFS volume.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to mount a crafted XFS volume on the target system.

## Additional Details From the Documents

### Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2420-2
- The advisory mentions that "Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system hang".
- The impact is described as "An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of service."

### Fedora Update Notifications
-   The Fedora updates indicate that the fix for CVE-2020-12655 addresses an issue described as "kernel: sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata."

### Red Hat Bugzilla
- The bug description states: "An attacker who is able to mount a xfs filesystem can trigger a denial of service while attempting to sync a file located an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata."
- It also provides a reference to the upstream commit fixing the issue: <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d0c7feaf87678371c2c09b3709400be416b2dc62>.

### SUSE CVE page
- The SUSE page states "An attacker with the ability to mount an XFS filesystem can trigger a denial of service while attempting to sync a file located on an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata."
- It also notes that it "requires an attacker being able to have the system mount a crafted filesystem"
- The SUSE document rates this vulnerability as "Low" from a security impact perspective.

### Git Commit Message
- The git commit message for the fix describes the root cause in more detail: â€œWe recently used fuzz(hydra) to test XFS and automatically generate tmp.img(XFS v5 format, but some metadata is wrong)".
- The message also highlights that the vulnerability leads to a system hang during sync operations.

Based on these extracted details, the vulnerability in CVE-2020-12655 is caused by the kernel's insufficient handling of crafted XFS v5 metadata, specifically during file sync operations, that may lead to a denial of service.
