{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The rConfig is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of randomization of the session and reuse session (prior login, after login).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Session fixation",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can set the user session and take control of the user's account.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by chaining it with XSS, setting a session ID via an XSS vulnerability. For example by using `https://ip-rconfig/configDevice.php?rid=\"><script>document.cookie=\"PHPSESSID=123456789\"</script>`",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into visiting a crafted URL that exploits an XSS vulnerability to set the session ID."
