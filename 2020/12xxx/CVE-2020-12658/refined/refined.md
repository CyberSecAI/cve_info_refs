Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from a missing `pthread_mutex_unlock` call before `pthread_exit` in the `gp_worker_main()` function within `src/gp_workers.c` of gssproxy. This occurs when the worker thread is shutting down.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Mutex Lock Not Released:** The primary vulnerability is that the `cond_mutex` is not unlocked before the thread exits via `pthread_exit`. This leaves the mutex locked when the thread is terminated.
- **Potential Resource Leak:** While not explicitly stated, holding a mutex lock on thread exit could potentially lead to issues when other threads attempt to acquire the lock in later operations, possibly leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is that the locked mutex could cause other threads to stall indefinitely when trying to acquire it, potentially leading to a denial of service.  However, comments from the developers suggest this is a minor issue as it's on an exit path and doesn't cause a stall unless a specific shutdown path is triggered, which isn't common.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through triggering a specific shutdown sequence in gssproxy that causes the worker thread to exit via the problematic path. This is likely internal to the service.
- There's no indication of external input directly causing this, so an attacker must indirectly trigger a shutdown of a worker thread that is holding the mutex lock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to cause `gssproxy` to shut down its worker threads in the affected manner. This requires more than normal usage and is likely an administrative or otherwise uncommon operation.  It is not clear if this can be achieved through network access or if this requires local access.
- The attacker does not need to be a privileged user to exploit the issue, as this exists within the `gssproxy` process itself.
- There is debate in the comments on whether this is a true vulnerability as it requires an unusual shutdown process and does not cause an immediate failure.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in `gssproxy` (CVE-2020-12658) arises from a mutex not being unlocked before thread exit, potentially leading to a denial-of-service when other threads are waiting for that lock. The circumstances for exploitation seem uncommon, and the issue is likely internal to the gssproxy daemon. It has been disputed by the developers and they attempted to have the CVE rejected.
