Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12399:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents contain direct references to CVE-2020-12399 and describe the vulnerability associated with it. Therefore, the content is considered relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a timing difference during DSA signature generation within the Network Security Services (NSS) library. Specifically, the nonce value 'k' used in the DSA algorithm was not padded, leading to a variable-length exponentiation. This allowed attackers to observe timing differences based on the length of 'k'.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Timing Side Channel:** The primary weakness is the timing variation in the modular exponentiation function during DSA signature generation, specifically when processing the nonce. The length of the nonce was directly reflected in the execution time of the operation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Private Key Exposure:** An attacker, by measuring the time it takes to compute a DSA signature, can categorize the signature timing into buckets, each associated with different lengths of the nonce. This information can then be used in a lattice calculation to recover the DSA private key.
- **Impersonation:**  Compromised private keys would enable an attacker to impersonate the legitimate user to services that rely on these keys, like in the case of Firefox Accounts.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Timing Analysis:** The attack vector is performing timing analysis of DSA signature operations. The attacker would need to make a number of signature requests, measure their processing time, and categorize those timings.
- **Network Interception (in some cases):** In the case of FxA, an attacker intercepting a BrowserID assertion signed with a vulnerable DSA key can potentially learn the corresponding private key if they can measure signing operations.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Measure Timings:** The attacker needs the ability to measure the time it takes to generate a DSA signature on a target system. This could involve local or remote access depending on the setup.
- **Access to DSA Operations:** The attacker needs to trigger DSA signing operations to measure the timings.
- **Lattice Calculation Expertise:**  Post timing analysis, the attacker needs to perform lattice calculations which requires knowledge of the underlying math and tools.

**Additional Notes from the Provided Content:**

- **Mitigation:** The provided fix involves padding the nonce value 'k' to a fixed length, effectively eliminating the timing differences during modular exponentiation. This approach, while simple, comes at the cost of doubling the execution time of the DSA operation but since DSA is not a high volume operation this impact was deemed acceptable.
- **Affected Software:** This vulnerability affected applications using the NSS library for DSA signature operations. It notably impacted Firefox, Firefox ESR and Thunderbird, as well as other software using NSS on operating systems like Debian and Ubuntu.
- **Fix Timeline:** The fix was implemented and backported to affected versions of Firefox (77 and ESR 68.9) as well as included in a point release of NSS (3.52.1)
- **Security Assessment:** This vulnerability was considered a high priority security issue, because the ability to extract private keys could be used to impersonate users.
- **CVE Assignment:** CVE-2020-12399 was assigned to track this specific issue.
- **BrowserID/FxA Impact:** The issue was also confirmed to be exploitable by malicious or compromised Sync Tokenservers in a scenario where a user was signed into Firefox with their Firefox Account.
