Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the React application for rendering closed captions. This allowed for the execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code injected into the captions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property bypasses React's standard sanitization and allows a user to inject malicious script into the closed captions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the closed captions, which would be executed in the browsers of all users viewing the captions. This could lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing user data

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malicious code into the closed caption editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Moderator-level permissions within the BigBlueButton application.
- In a breakout room context, all users are granted moderator permissions and could inject malicious code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property from the captions component and using a safer method for rendering captions.
- The vulnerability was present in BigBlueButton versions prior to v2.2.4.
- The vulnerability was reported to MITRE and assigned CVE-2020-12113.
