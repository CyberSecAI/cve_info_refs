- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An information disclosure flaw exists in the Symantec Messaging Gateway (SMG) web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. Specifically, a privileged web UI user can access a password for a remote SCP backup server that they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious, authenticated, privileged web UI user can obtain sensitive information, specifically the password for a remote SCP backup server. This could lead to further unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI of the SMG.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a malicious, authenticated, privileged user of the SMG web UI.
