Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2020-12063 vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in Postfix when handling email sender addresses. Specifically, Postfix does not prevent the use of homoglyphs (characters that look similar to other characters) in sender addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Homoglyph Attack:**  An attacker can substitute a character in a legitimate sender address with a homoglyph character. For example, replacing the letter "o" with the Greek lowercase omicron "Î¿" (\xce\xbf), which visually appears the same.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Postfix fails to recognize these homoglyph characters as different from their visually similar counterparts, leading to bypass of sender authentication checks.
*   **Bypassing sender restrictions:** The vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to send emails that appear to originate from a user that is configured in the system. The attacker can spoof email senders with homoglyphs, bypassing security controls put in place by configurations such as `smtpd_sender_login_maps`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Email Spoofing:** An attacker can send emails with a forged "From" address, making it appear as though the email came from a legitimate user on the system.
*   **Social Engineering:** This spoofing capability can be used to launch more credible social engineering attacks, tricking recipients into believing they are receiving messages from a trusted source. This could lead to phishing or malware distribution.
*  **Bypassing access controls**: The attacker can potentially circumvent restrictions placed on authorized senders. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote SMTP Connection:** The attacker connects to the SMTP server remotely (e.g., using netcat or a similar tool).
*   **Crafted Sender Address:** The attacker specifies a sender address in the `MAIL FROM` command which includes homoglyphs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target mail server's SMTP port (typically port 25).
*   **Knowledge of Target Users:** The attacker benefits from knowledge of valid local users on the target mail server for effective spoofing. No authentication required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The initial report incorrectly stated the vulnerable version as `3.3.0-1`.  The reporter later clarified the vulnerability was found in version `2.10.1-7.el7.x86_64`.
*   The vulnerability is not directly related to the `smtpd_sender_login_maps` configuration. While this setting is a security control to restrict who can send mail as a specific user, the homoglyph attack allows bypassing that control by creating a sender address that appears legitimate, yet is not in the table.
* Wietse Venema, a Postfix developer, confirmed that the "Sender address rejected: not logged in" error message is generated when the client attempts to send an email with an envelope sender that is listed in `smtpd_sender_login_maps` but is not properly authenticated. The vulnerability lies in the fact that it is possible to bypass this check by creating a visually similar address via homoglyphs.
