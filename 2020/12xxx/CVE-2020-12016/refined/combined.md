Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker with physical access to gain unauthorized access to view/update system configuration or data. This

could impact confidentiality and integrity of the system and risk exposure of sensitive information including PHI.

[CVE-2020-12012](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12012) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.3    [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)

Baxter ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10, 1.11 and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2 systems use cleartext messages to communicate order information with an order entry system. This could allow an attacker with network access to view sensitive data including PHI.

[CVE-2020-12008](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12008) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

#### 4.2.4    [MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)

Baxter ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10, 1.11 and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1, 1.2 systems store device data with sensitive information in an unencrypted database. This could allow an attacker with network access to view or modify sensitive data including PHI.

[CVE-2020-12032](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-12032) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Baxter recommends that users of the ExactaMix EM 2400 Versions 1.10 and 1.11, and ExactaMix EM1200 Versions 1.1 and 1.2, should contact the service support team or regional product service support to upgrade to the ExactaMix Version 1.4 (EM1200) and ExactaMix Version 1.13 (EM2400) compounders.

For all users, Baxter recommends the following compensating controls including, but not limited to:

* Ensure appropriate physical controls within user’s environments to protect against unauthorized access to devices.
* Ensure ExactaMix Compounder passwords are kept confidential. Users should implement administrative controls to ensure they are not misused, mismanaged, or otherwise shared with unauthorized individuals.
* The device should be used only in accordance with its intended use and not for email, Internet access, file sharing, or other non-approved use. No software of any kind should be installed on the device unless approved, in writing, by Baxter.
* The ExactaMix Compounder should be segmented from the enterprise main network, and block all non-required communication via firewall and ACL configuration.
* Users should follow standard guidance to ensure security patches are up to date across the network.
* Users should follow proper backup and storage procedures to maintain the integrity of data utilized with the ExactaMix Compounder.

Baxter separately provided an ExactaMix Cybersecurity Guide, instructing users on good cybersecurity practices relevant to the use of the ExactaMix product. The guide can be requested from productsecurity@baxter.com

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* Where additional information is needed, refer to existing [cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health/cybersecurity).

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
