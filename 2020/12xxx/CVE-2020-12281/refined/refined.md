{
  "CVE ID": "CVE-2020-12281",
  "Root cause": "The provided document is a report on a security assessment of the iSmartgate PRO smart garage system, and it details a number of vulnerabilities, including a 'one-click-root attack' that combines three separate vulnerabilities. The root causes are the vulnerabilities themselves.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Clickjacking",
    "SQL Injection",
    "Broken Authentication",
    "Sensitive Data Exposure",
     "XML External Entities (XXE)",
     "Broken Access Control",
     "Security Misconfiguration",
     "Insecure Deserialization",
     "Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities",
     "Insufficient Logging & Monitoring"
  ],
  "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker could gain root access to the web server of the controller, steal user session cookies, open garage doors, or create new user accounts with remote access to the system. This could lead to physical access, privacy violation, or a complete compromise of the device. The 'one-click-root attack' is especially severe, giving the attacker full control over the device, as well as the ability to steal data and create denial of service conditions.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Phishing emails with malicious links",
    "Malicious websites with auto-submitting forms",
    "Exploiting vulnerable file upload functionalities",
    "JavaScript injection"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have basic web development knowledge (e.g. creating a web page with a POST form) and the ability to create and use a netcat connection. Some exploits require knowledge about bypassing file validation.",
  "Additional details": "The report provides more detail than a standard CVE entry, including specific attack scenarios, proof-of-concept code, and a detailed analysis of the root cause of each vulnerability. The report explicitly mentions that the session cookie used in the iSmartgate PRO system is valid for 72-94 hours."
