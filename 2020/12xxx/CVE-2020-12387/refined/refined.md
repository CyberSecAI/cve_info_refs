Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12387:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists during the shutdown of Web Workers, specifically when handling XMLHttpRequest operations. This race leads to a use-after-free error. The core of the problem lies in the interaction between the worker's shutdown process, the execution of synchronous XMLHttpRequest operations, and the asynchronous nature of event handling, particularly with BroadcastChannel. The use of a raw, non-owning pointer in `XMLHttpRequestWorker::EventRunnable::WorkerRun` contributed to the use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free (UAF):** A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to a crash or potential arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability occurred because the `mProxy` pointer to an `XMLHttpRequestWorker` was accessed after the object was deallocated in a worker thread context. This was specifically related to the way `ProgressEvent` objects were created, which obtained an owning reference based on a non-owning pointer.
- **Re-entrancy Issues:** The code did not adequately prevent re-entrant calls to content JS during syncloop destruction, especially with BroadcastChannel.
- **Insufficient Locking:** Inadequate synchronization or locking during worker shutdown allows a race condition.
- **Incorrect Invariant Handling:** The code made incorrect assumptions regarding the worker's state, particularly during asynchronous operations and event dispatches within the sync loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use-after-free could lead to an exploitable crash, potentially enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process. Specifically, the provided proof-of-concept (PoC) achieved EIP control on 32-bit Firefox.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could cause a crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition, which affects the stability of the browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted web page:** A remote attacker can entice a user to visit a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerability through the use of Web Workers, XMLHttpRequest, and BroadcastChannel. The exploit involves complex interactions within the worker, including file reader operations, synchronous XMLHttpRequests and the self.close() call.
- **Malicious email:**  Although scripting is disabled when reading mail in Thunderbird, the vulnerability could be exploited in browser-like contexts if the crafted email triggers the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and needs to entice the victim to load the malicious web page or view the malicious email in a vulnerable Thunderbird.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with the malicious content (either visiting the page or opening a malicious email) for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was triggered by a nested syncloop scenario during worker shutdown. This involves a worker that does a synchronous XHR, aborts the XHR, closes the worker via `self.close()`, and also involves `BroadcastChannel` messages. This causes a nested clearing/syncloop destruction.
- Multiple fixes were required to address the issues including preventing content JS execution during `ClearMainEventQueue`, hardening `DOMEventTargetHelper` to disallow event dispatches after `self.close()` and preventing syncloop re-entrancy.

- The vulnerability was initially reported with a crash report on ASAN and was subsequently proven to give an attacker EIP control on 32-bit builds of the browser.
- The bug report timeline shows a long iterative process of analyzing the vulnerability, developing fixes and the complications with landing those fixes.
