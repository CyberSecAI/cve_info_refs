{
  "CVE-2020-12641": {
    "Description": "rcube_image.php in Roundcube Webmail before 1.4.4 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in a configuration setting for im_convert_path or im_identify_path.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `im_convert_path` and `im_identify_path` configuration settings in Roundcube do not sanitize shell metacharacters, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Insecure configuration"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the Roundcube instance.",
    "Attack vectors": "A network attacker with access to the Roundcube installer can inject malicious commands via crafted config options. The injected commands are executed when a user opens an email with a non-standard image format (e.g., TIF), triggering image conversion via the vulnerable `im_convert_path` configuration.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires network access to the Roundcube installer to modify the configuration settings. The attacker needs to be able to send emails to other users of the Roundcube instance."
