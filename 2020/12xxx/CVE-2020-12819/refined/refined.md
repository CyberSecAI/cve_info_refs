Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the processing of Link Control Protocol (LCP) messages within FortiOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, indicating a failure to properly manage memory allocation when handling LCP packets.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing LCP messages, which are used in point-to-point connections.
- The specific flaw is related to the size of LCP packets when tunnel mode is enabled on SSL VPN.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the SSL VPN daemon to crash.
- Although theoretically possible, arbitrary code execution is considered practically very difficult to achieve due to the context in which the overflow occurs.
- The confidentiality impact is none, integrity impact is low, and availability impact is low.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote over the network.
- A remote attacker with valid SSL VPN credentials is required to send a large LCP packet.
- The vulnerability is triggered when SSL VPN tunnel mode is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs valid SSL VPN credentials.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted LCP packets to the vulnerable device.
- The targeted FortiOS device must have tunnel mode enabled for SSL VPN.
