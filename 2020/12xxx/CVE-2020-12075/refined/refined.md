The content is related to CVE-2020-12075 and provides more details than the official CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks proper capability checks and nonce verification for AJAX actions, leading to insecure permissions, stored XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Insecure Permissions on AJAX Actions:** AJAX actions lack capability checks, allowing any logged-in user (subscriber or above) to execute administrative actions.
2.  **Authenticated Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected into data table fields, which executes when a user accesses a page containing the data table. This is due to unfiltered_html capabilities being granted to non-admin users through the vulnerable AJAX endpoints.
3.  **CSRF:** The lack of WordPress nonces for CSRF protection allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of any logged-in user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **Insecure Permissions:** Attackers can create, modify, rename and delete data tables.
2.  **Stored XSS:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript in site visitors' browsers, leading to malicious site redirection, new admin account creation, and other malicious actions.
3.  **CSRF:** Attackers can modify data tables, inject malicious JavaScript, and perform other malicious actions by tricking authenticated users into clicking malicious links.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Insecure Permissions:** Directly through vulnerable AJAX endpoints using a logged-in user account.
2.  **Stored XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript through vulnerable AJAX endpoints, which is then triggered when a user views the modified data table.
3. **CSRF:** Tricking authenticated users into clicking malicious links or opening malicious attachments, causing a forged request to be sent on their behalf.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. **Insecure Permissions & Stored XSS:** Requires a user account with subscriber or higher permissions on the target WordPress site.
2. **CSRF:** Requires no specific user account access, but requires tricking a logged-in user into performing an action.
