# QtGui: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **202007-38**

A use-after-free was discovered in QtGui's Markdown handling code
possibly allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-qt/qtgui** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.14.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.14.2** |

### Background

QtGui is a module for the Qt toolkit.

### Description

QtGui’s setMarkdown has a use-after-free related to
QTextMarkdownImporter::insertBlock.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QtGui users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-qt/qtgui-5.14.2"

```

Note that the Qt suite is best kept in sync, so a world upgrade may be
advisable to keep your system in a good state.
