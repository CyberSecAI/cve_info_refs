Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12485:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The frame touch module in certain vivo devices does not perform proper validation on the length of specific parameters before processing them. This lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds memory access when the module attempts to access memory locations beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds memory access:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation, specifically the length of parameters processed by the frame touch module. This lack of validation leads to the module attempting to read or write to memory locations outside the allocated buffer, resulting in the out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a local DoS on the affected device. This means the device becomes unresponsive or unusable until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the device locally to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trigger the frame touch module with specially crafted parameters. The CVSS score indicates that user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Affected Software Versions:**

*   All vivo devices running Android 10 and using the vulnerable Frame Touch Module are affected. Specific affected models are not detailed in the document, but generic affected version is specified: `All models whose system is Android 10`
*   The following model's affected versions are listed in the document:
    *   PD2012: Prior to 1.4.0
    *   PD1965EF: Prior to EX\_EU\_4.4.0
    *   PD2001F: Prior to EX\_1.6.0
    *   PD1968F: Prior to EX\_1.10.1
    *   PD1962: Prior to 1.7.6
    *   PD1981: Prior to 1.5.0
    *  PD2006F: Prior to EX\_1.6.2

**Fix:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions of the Frame Touch Module:
    *   PD2012\_1.4.0
    *   PD1965EF\_EX\_EU\_4.4.0
    *   PD2001F\_EX\_1.6.0
    *   PD1968F\_EX\_1.10.1
    *   PD1962\_1.7.6
    *   PD1981\_1.5.0
    *   PD2006F\_EX\_1.6.2
    *   or later versions.
*   The fix can be obtained by performing system updates.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by CytQ through vivo SRC.
*   The advisory provides a good explanation of the vulnerability, its impact, and how to fix it.
*   The CVSS score is 5.5 (Medium), with vectors AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. This means the attack is local, requires user interaction, does not affect confidentiality or integrity, and has high availability impact.
