- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in the Web-Based Management (WBM) of WAGO programmable logic controllers (PLCs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The WBM allows changing specific parameters via crafted requests without requiring authentication. This is due to improper authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the device's parameter settings, potentially causing malfunctions after a reboot. This includes disruption of the application running on the PLC.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the web interface of the WAGO PLCs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the WBM and some knowledge of the WBM's directory structure to craft the requests. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the attack.
