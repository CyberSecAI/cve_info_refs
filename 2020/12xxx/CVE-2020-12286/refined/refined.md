Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper scoping for the `TaskView` permission in Octopus Deploy. This means that users with the `TaskView` permission can view server tasks regardless of their assigned scope (e.g., specific projects, environments, or tenants).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the insufficient access control mechanism for the `TaskView` permission. It fails to enforce tenant-based or other dimensional scoping.
-   **Information Disclosure:**  A scoped user could potentially view task information related to resources or tenants they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** A user scoped to a specific tenant, for example, could view server tasks related to other tenants, which might contain sensitive information, such as project names, task details, environment configurations, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Privilege Escalation (Horizontal):** An attacker, with a limited scope of access but possessing `TaskView` permission, could view tasks related to other tenants and gain unauthorized insight into other parts of the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account within Octopus Deploy.
-   **`TaskView` Permission:** The user must have the `TaskView` permission. This is a basic, built-in permission, so it's likely to be granted to a range of user types.
-  **Knowledge of Octopus Deploy:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how Octopus Deploy works to navigate and extract the desired information.

**Affected Versions:**

- Octopus Deploy versions 2019.7.1 through 2020.1.11 are affected, excluding any 2019.12.* version after 2019.12.9.

**Fixed Versions:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in Octopus Deploy versions 2019.12.9, 2020.1.12, and later.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided GitHub issue links (`OctopusDeploy/Issues#6331`, `OctopusDeploy/Issues#6332`, `OctopusDeploy/Issues#6333`) and the referenced pull request (`OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/pull/5660`) provide more context on the bug and the fix.
- The advisory also mentions a related private issue, `OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/issues/5664`, that may contain additional information on the details of the security fix.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" severity.

**CWE:**

- CWE-200: Information Exposure

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2020-12286 which states "In Octopus Deploy before 2019.12.9 and 2020 before 2020.1.12, the TaskView permission is not scoped to any dimension. For example, a scoped user who is scoped to only one tenant can view server tasks scoped to any other tenant."
