Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-12474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) Homograph attack flaw in Telegram Desktop, Android, and iOS applications. This allows an attacker to create visually similar but technically different URLs using Punycode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IDN Homograph Attack:** The applications fail to properly validate and display URLs containing Punycode, allowing for the creation of spoofed links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Spoofing:** Attackers can create spoofed shared link URLs and group chat invites that appear legitimate to users.
- **Malicious Redirect:** When a user clicks on these spoofed links, they are redirected to a malicious website controlled by the attacker.
- **Phishing/Malware:** The attacker can then perform any suspicious activity, such as phishing for credentials or installing malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Content:** The attacker crafts a URL containing Punycode to mimic a legitimate URL.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker sends this specially crafted URL to the victim through Telegram, making it look like a normal shared link or group chat invitation.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click/open the punycode embedded URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim. They can be anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker needs the ability to send messages to the victim on Telegram.
- **Punycode Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to generate URLs using Punycode that look visually similar to legitimate URLs.
