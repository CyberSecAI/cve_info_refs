{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of border-image segments with zero slice size in WebRender, leading to reading uninitialized memory from GPU textures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of zero slice size leading to out-of-bounds read.",
      "Exposure of uninitialized memory from GPU."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could leak arbitrary GPU memory to the visible screen. The leaked memory could potentially contain data from other processes, including live video streams if they're in GPU memory. However, the leaked memory is only visible to the user and not directly accessible from the web content itself. If an attacker manages to read back webrender's memory, this could let them read random things from other process's gpu memory. It also would take a security exploit for a page to be able to read webrender's gpu memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a web page with specific CSS border-image properties that result in zero slice sizes in WebRender."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to display a webpage with specific CSS properties using WebRender. This doesn't need any special capabilities besides the usual ability to load and render web pages. Exploitation would involve crafting a specific webpage and not other capabilities."
