## FAQ

### How can I send feedback or get help with a bug?

For any bug reports go to [Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/drag-and-drop-multiple-file-upload-contact-form-7) page.

### How can I limit file size?

To limit file size in `multiple file upload` field generator under Contact Form 7, there’s a field `File size limit (bytes)`.

You can also manually add limit parameter in existing [mfile] tag.

Example: *[mfile upload-file-433 limit:20971520]* – This limit the user to upload upto 20MB only.

Please take note it should be `Bytes` you may use any converter just Google (MB to Bytes converter) default of this plugin is 5MB(5242880 Bytes).

### How can I limit the number of files in my Upload?

You can limit the number of files in your file upload by adding this parameter `max-file:3` to your shortcode :

Example: *[mfile upload-file-344 max-file:3]* – this option will limit the user to upload only 3 files.

### How can I Add or Limit file types

You can add or change file types in cf7 Form-tag Generator Options by adding `jpeg|png|jpg|gif` in `Acceptable file types field`.

Example : *[mfile upload-file-433 filetypes:jpeg|png|jpg|gif]*

### How can I change text in Drag and Drop Uploading area?

You can change text `Drag & Drop Files Here or Browse Files` text in WordPress Admin menu under `Contact` > `Drag & Drop Upload`.

### How to Display Links in an Email

Some email servers have limitations on file attachment sizes (e.g., Google allows a maximum of 20-25 MB). Attaching large files to emails can be problematic. Consider using this option to display links in the email instead of attaching the files.

Go to WP Admin `Contact -> Drag & Drop Upload` settings then check “Send Attachment as links?” option.

To manage mail template, go to Contact Forms edit specific form and Select `Mail` tab. In `Message Body` add generated code from [mfile]. ( Example Below )

Message Body : [your-message]

File Links 1 : [upload-file-754]

File Links2 : [upload-file-755]

Note : No need to add in `File Attachments` field.

See [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvuvmzIImYo&t=232s)

### How to Attach Files to an Email

1. In order to attach files to email you will need to check and make sure **“send as file(s) as links”** option is unchecked.
2. Go to WordPress admin menu “Contact -> Edit {specific\_form}” click or hover the cf7 form you want to edit.
3. In **“Edit Contact Form”** page click “Mail” tab and in the bottom you will see **“File attachments”** field, on this field add your upload field name (ie: **[upload-file-xxx]**), you will find the upload name in **“Form”** tab generated from `[mfile]` shortcode.
4. If attaching multiple files from a different file upload just add all the upload fields name. (see example below)

   File attachments: `[upload-file-111] [upload-file-222]`

See [Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvuvmzIImYo&t=113s)

Like said in the title: works like a charm.Then only thing is that it still uses jQuery which is absolutely not necessary in these days.I’d love to rewrite it to vanilla javascript which seems not to be very complicated.

Perfect plugin. Works a charm. Not hazzle in setting it its allmost straight foward. U can keep your uploaded PDF files. U can send them as an attachment link, just add the CF7 shortcode that add on the pannel and your good to go. Plugin tells you the upload progress and disables the send button, pus has a drag an drop function thats cool. Well done.
