## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141959#c0)â€¢ 10 years ago |
|  | |

For codebase URIs with IPv6 host literals like
<http://[::1]/>
nsPrincipal::GetOriginForURI() returns
[http:/::1/](http:///%3A%3A1/)
because it just concatenates nsIURI.scheme + "://" + nsIURI.asciiHost + ":" + nsIURI.port, "forgetting" to special case IPv6 hosts enclosing them with brackets.
This gets especially confusing and likely unsafe when explicit ports are added to the mix, potentially producing invalid URIs and/or duplicate strings for actually different origins.

|  | |

This should probably use NS\_GenerateHostPort instead of doing the the manual AppendInt thing...
That said, is there a reason this can't just use nsContentUtils::GetAsciiOrigin instead of duplicating code? Presumably after we do the isChrome check.

It looks like this method is only used for app-y stuff.

|  | |

CritSmash would like to rate this, but we need to understand where this code is used. Is this a URI parsing method that lives in a general location and is used for IPv6 hosts everywhere? Or is it just used - as Andrew asks - for something like apps or the like?

It lives in nsPrincipal, which is a "general location" mostly used for security checks.

I'm calling this moderate because we don't know of a place that will misuse this and end up with a security problem, but it's quite plausible that something's going to get into trouble.Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

Dragana,

Tom pointed out that in the test (see attachment) prinicpal.host is not canonicalized, e.g.

"<http://[20D1:0000:3238:DFE1:63:0000:0000:FEFB]/>"

"<http://[20D1:0:3238:DFE1:63::FEFB]/>"

are the exact same, which implies that storage from one could be accessed by the other.

I tried to trace down the problem, and I think the problem happens within the creation of an nsIURI. Anyway, all the code within nsIURI seems critical. Is there even an easy fix to account for canonicalized IPV6 addresses?

I'm not sure I understand. The URL parser turns the IPv6 into canonicalized versions, and principal.origin reflects the same canonical form.

Since "<http://[20D1:0000:3238:DFE1:63:0000:0000:FEFB]/>" always gets parsed as "<http://[20d1:0:3238:dfe1:63::fefb]/>", that shouldn't really be a problem. Or is there something else I'm missing?

That may the answer then. "The Principal object will construct a principal based on the url it is given; if the url is not canonicalized, it won't be a canonicalized principal. But there should be no way to construct a principal with a non-canonicalized url, so that behavior is okay."

In which case we ought to be able to assert in Principal if we receive a non-canonicalized url.

I'd propose sending a try run with a moz\_assert, and then land a diagnostic assert behind a pref (on by default, but this enables people to turn the assert off), and monitor crashes and be prepared to backout. If Nightly is clean w.r.t this we could make it a release assert.

Upstream usrsctp has been notified about a buffer overflow in their implementation.

The patch for it is available upstream here <https://github.com/sctplab/usrsctp/commit/e1dd9bea4f438abf4d4c3b658f1db8f013157184>

Alternatively we could work around the problematic code path by disabling SCTP authentication with the following (as that feature isn't used in webrtc any way):

usrsctp\_sysctl\_set\_sctp\_asconf\_enable(0);

usrsctp\_sysctl\_set\_sctp\_auth\_enable(0);

Public commit doesn't literally say "SECURITY BUG!" but it does thank a prominent member of Google Project Zero. We should get a fix into 76 and ESR. Nils suggests using the the "turn it off" patch for uplift. I wouldn't mind taking both!

[Bug 1632241](/show_bug.cgi?id=1632241 "RESOLVED FIXED - Buffer overflow in sctp chunk input validation"): add SCTP auth token boundary check

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Not very hard with knowledge on how WebRTC data channel works.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Not very likely as the affected code paths normally should not be triggered by normal WebRTC endpoints.

[Bug 1632241](/show_bug.cgi?id=1632241 "RESOLVED FIXED - Buffer overflow in sctp chunk input validation"): add SCTP auth token boundary check

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: It is sec-high
* **User impact if declined**: Users would be exposed to the technically possible drive-by buffer overflow.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 76
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The risk is low, because the buffer overflow is on a code path which is normally not used in WebRTC. That means only a specifically crafted PeerConnection endpoints which sends packets which are normally not send as part of WebRTC connection could trigger this.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: N/A

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |
