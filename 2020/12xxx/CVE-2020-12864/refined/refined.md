{
  "CVE-2020-12864": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `memcpy` at `epsonds-net.c, line 164` can read uninitialized data. The value of `size` is controlled by the attacker, so the attacker can specify that `size == 0`. Since `s->netbuf` is a newly allocated heap buffer, it contains uninitialized memory.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Reading uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "By itself, the severity of this issue is very low. However, it may be very useful to an attacker who is attempting to exploit one of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities, such as issue 3, because it may enable the attacker to obtain the ASLR offsets of the program.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim can send crafted packets to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the victim."
