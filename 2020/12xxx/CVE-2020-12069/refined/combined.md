#### Impact

Please consult the CVE entries for further information.

#### Solution

We recommend all effected users to update to firmware version 03.07.14(19) or later (see list of affected devices).

****Mitigation****

CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:

* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside
* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
* Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
* Activate and apply user management and password features
* Use encrypted communication links
* Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
* Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions

For further impact information and risk mitigation, please refer to the official CODESYS Advisory Website at <https://www.codesys.com/security/security-reports.html>

This issue will be handled with next hardware generation release.**

**General recommendations**

Festo strongly recommends to minimize and protect network access to connected devices with state of the art techniques and processes. Festo also highly recommends to apply available firmware updates containig security related changes as soon as possible. For a secure operation follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Until Festo provides a firmware-update with CODESYS runtime patching the vulnerabilities general recommendation is to:

1. Do not use the Codesys Web server of the Web-visualization.
2. The access to a PLC with an active webserver should be restricted on network level to participants for whom it is strictly necessary. Also, the PLC should never be exposed to the internet. Assist IT staff to block access (from outside of company network or from outside of virtual network assigned to machines) to PLC through existing network equipment (routers, firewalls etc) by blocking specific ports and protocols (UDP, TCP).
3. PLC with WEB server active shall only include visualization screens in the application that are intended for being accessed by operators of the CODESYS WebVisu and the CODESYS Remote TargetVisu.
4. Activation of the Codesys device user management and visualization user management if Web visualization is used.
   * With the activation of the user management on the device any online service requires an appropriate authentication. It is highly recommended to setup at least one administrator user. Moreover, a set of users belonging to the appropriate groups allow maintaining leveled access rights.
   * Use the protection of the user management in the CODESYS visualization not only for the navigation elements but also for all elements that should be restricted to certain operators only.

As part of a security strategy, Festo supports the CODESYS GmbH recommended following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:

* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside
* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks - Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
* Activate and apply user management and password features
* Use encrypted communication links
* Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
* Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable
industrial controller and provides several security features to secure the devices. To limit the access to the
programming port, it allows defining users with individual passwords or also to configure a role based user
management with graded access rights and multiple users. These user credentials are insufficiently protected
by the online user management of the CODESYS Control runtime systems.

© CODESYS Group

4/8

Advisory 2019-08

In detail this advisory comprises the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2019-9011: Observable response discrepancy
Based on the communication responses of the CODESYS Control runtime system an attacker may be able to
enumerate valid users names.

CVE-2019-9013: Insufficiently protected credentials on transport
Without using the TLS based encrypted CODESYS online communication, the user credentials are insufficiently
protected on transport.

CVE-2020-12067: Unverified password change
When setting a new password for a user, the CODESYS Control runtime system does not ask for the original
password.

CVE-2020-12069: Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort
The CODESYS Control runtime system stores the online communication passwords using a weak hashing
algorithm.

CVE-2020-6081: Remote code execution
In order to implement a programmable logic controller, the CODESYS Control runtime system allows code
downloading and execution. An attacker could utilize this PLC functionality for malicious purposes if access to
the PLC is not secured by the online user management of the CODESYS Control runtime system.

3.2  Exploitability

To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker needs access to the online communication traffic or local access to
the PLC.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities, but we are aware of some publicly available
information that would allow an exploit to occur.

4  Available software updates

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has released version V3.5.16.0 to solve the noted vulnerability issue for all
affected CODESYS products.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

With CODESYS V3.5.16.0, the online user management of the CODESYS Control runtime system has been
redesigned. Many parts have been implemented in a compatible way, but it was necessary to do some
incompatible changes for security reasons:

• All CODESYS communication clients with a version V3.5.16.0 or higher still support all online features of new
and old CODESYS runtime systems. In opposite to that, clients before version V3.5.16.0 can still login and
communicate with CODESYS runtime systems with a version V3.5.16.0 or higher, but are not able anymore to
modify the online user management on the PLC device. This limitation includes user, password, group and
access right modifications.

• On initial startup, an updated CODESYS Control runtime system converts the older user management
database into the new format, which is incompatible to the old one. To prepare a later downgrade of the
CODESYS Control runtime system to a version before V3.5.16.0, we recommend to backing up the user
management before updating to version V3.5.16.0. For this purpose the user management can be saved by the
CODESYS Development System in a *.dum file and restored again after downgrading to a version before
V3.5.16.0.

• Since version V3.5.16.0, user names, group names and passwords are limited to a maximum of 59 characters.
Existing user management configurations that exceed this limit cannot be successfully converted by the

5/8

Advisory 2019-08

CODESYS Control runtime system.

• For CODESYS Control runtime system version V3.5.16.0, it is not possible anymore to rename user groups.

• Up to version V3.5.16.0, there was a default user "Administrator" with a default password. When activating the
user management, you had to log in with these user data and then change the password. With version V3.5
16.0 this default user was removed. To activate the user management, a new user with a freely selectable user
name and password must be created. This first user automatically gets administrator rights.

• For CODESYS Control runtime system versions V3.5.16.0 and higher the "Users and Groups" page within the
CODESYS Development System to configure the CODESYS Control runtime system's user management is a
pure online editor. Every change to the editor will be transmitted immediately to the runtime system and there
are no data kept within the CODESYS Development System. Because of this the *.dum file format to import or
export the user management is not supported anymore for V3.5.16.0 CODESYS Control runtime systems. In
contrast to this, the *.drm file format containing the user rights was not changed and the handling of this is as it
was before.

• As replacement for the *.dum file, there is a new *.dum2 file, which is exported (created) and imported by the
CODESYS Control runtime system itself. The user can trigger the generation and upload of the *.dum2 file by
the CODESYS Development System to back up the user management configuration. For further protection, this
file is optionally encrypted with a user chosen password. During download of the *.dum2 file, the password is
requested by the CODESYS Control runtime system to restore the user management. The en-/decryption is
handled on this device itself.

• With V3.5.16.0, the user group "Everyone" was removed from the runtime system. When importing an existing
user management, this user group will be skipped from the old database. Because of this, imported groups may
have less rights than before, if you did modify the CODESYS provided default groups or add own groups. In this
case, you have to add the previously granted access rights of the group "Everyone" to all other groups. If you
have multiple devices, you can export the updated database and roll out this new version to all other devices.

• CODESYS Data Source Manager: If the communication is based on the data source type CODESYS
Application V3, there is at least the compiler version V3.5.16.0 necessary to support the new password
transport protection by this client. Thus, existing projects require an update of the compiler version.

For device manufacturers we provide additional update information as part of the CODESYS Control V3
Runtime System Documentation here (registration required): https://customers.codesys.com/product-
info/RTSOnlineHelp/Appendix/UserManagementUpdateInformation/index.html.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update for CODESYS Control runtime systems V3.5.17.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

With V3.5.17.0 we enter the next level. As of this version, the online user management of the CODESYS
Control runtime system is enforced by default.

Because of this, the user management must be activated, before clients can successfully log in to the
CODESYS Control runtime. This applies to the CODESYS Development System and all other clients such as
CODESYS HMI, PLCHandler, CODESYS OPC DA Server and OPC UA Clients. Activating the user
management can be done by connecting with a CODESYS Development System (version must be at least
V3.5.16.0). During the first connect, the user have to define an administrator user with own credentials.

We recommend using the administrator account only for administrative purposes, for example, to create
additional users or to configure the online user management. For operational access to the CODESYS Control
runtime system, additional users should be created and assigned to a group that only has the rights required for
the respective job.

In case of updating a CODESYS Control runtime system, an existing user management is taken over, otherwise
it is necessary to activate the user management.

In order to allow OPC UA clients still an anonymous login without needing to deactivate the user management
completely, starting with V3.5.17.0 an anonymous access can be granted for OPC UA clients. In this case, the
device user management remains active/enforced for all other clients.

Advisory 2019-08

To ensure that no attacker can hijack the controller directly after installation, the CODESYS Control runtime
system should only be commissioned in a secure environment. This includes all stages from the installation of
the CODESYS Control runtime system to the activation of the user management by creating the first
administrator user.

Please find more information in the CODESYS V3.5.17.0 Online help, chapter Security:
https://help.codesys.com/webapp/_cds_struct_security;product=codesys.

For device manufacturers we provide additional information on configuring the online user management in the
CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Documentation for V3.5.17.0, chapter "CODESYS Control - What's
new".

Note: We recently introduced a new version scheme for the CODESYS Control SL runtime system products.
The CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit V3.5.17.0 will be the base of version V4.1.0.0 of these
products.

5  Mitigation

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH strongly recommends using the available software update to fix the
vulnerabilities.

In order to protect the CODESYS Control runtime system, the online user management has to be activated or
preferably enforced if it has not yet been done. This not only prevents an attacker from downloading or
executing malicious code, but also suppresses start, stop, debug, or other actions on a known working
application that could potentially disrupt a machine or system.

To allow only trusted application code to be executed, the CODESYS Control runtime system also offers an
advanced setting for device manufacturers to configure the code protection level for boot and downloaded
applications. The SIGNED_AND_ENCRYPTED and MIN_SIGNED levels require that the CODESYS application
has been signed with a valid and trusted X.509 user certificate.

In addition, or at least in the case that the software update is not applied, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH
recommends activating and using encryption of online communication whenever possible. The encrypted
communication protects the password transmission by a TLS based encryption, independent of the weak
password transmission affected by the vulnerabilities above.

Online communication encryption, online user management, and application code protection have been
available for several service packs. For more information on enabling and enforcing encrypted communication
and user management, see the CODESYS online help.

Furthermore, unauthorized local and all other remote access to the CODESYS control runtime system's file
system must be prevented by additional means.

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends as part of the mitigation strategy the following defensive
measures to reduce the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
