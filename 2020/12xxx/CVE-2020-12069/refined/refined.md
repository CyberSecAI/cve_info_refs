Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an inadequate hashing procedure used to save passwords within the CODESYS Control runtime system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Password Hashing:** The system employs a hashing algorithm that lacks sufficient computational effort, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords.
- **Insufficient Protection of Credentials:** User credentials are not adequately protected by the online user management of the CODESYS Control runtime systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised User Credentials:** Attackers could potentially recover user passwords due to the weak hashing method. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system, its resources, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Online User Management:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by gaining access to the online communication traffic of the CODESYS Control runtime system or by local access to the PLC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Network Traffic:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or access the network traffic related to the CODESYS Control runtime system's online user management.
- **Local Access:**  An attacker with physical access to the PLC could also exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also mentions related vulnerabilities such as the ability to enumerate valid user names (CVE-2019-9011), change passwords without the original one (CVE-2020-12067), and vulnerabilities related to code execution.
- The provided documents include mitigation strategies and software updates to address the identified weaknesses.
