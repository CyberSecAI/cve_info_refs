Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12412:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-12412. The bug report for  [Bug 1528587](/show_bug.cgi?id=1528587) is explicitly identified as the source of the CVE and is titled  "Address bar spoof using history navigation and blocked ports" and includes the CVE alias.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in how Firefox handles session history when navigating to a restricted address (e.g., an address using a blocked port) and then navigating away from it using history API calls combined with `setTimeout`.  Specifically, when loading an error page (due to a blocked port), Firefox incorrectly stores the previous valid page’s mLSHE into mOSHE, causing a mismatch between the displayed URL and the actual document being rendered. This leads to the address bar displaying the incorrect URL while the page content is actually from a different, attacker-controlled source.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the address bar, making it display a different URL than the actual page loaded. This can mislead users into thinking they are on a legitimate site, when in reality, they are viewing attacker-controlled content.
*   **History API Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the browser's history through JavaScript's `history.go()` function in combination with `setTimeout` and navigating to restricted ports.
*   **Inconsistent Document Information:** The document's `baseURI` and `document.location.href` properties are inconsistent with the displayed address bar, indicating the docshell is confused. While the node principal of the document and the parent process's browser idea of the content principal are correct, the current URI and window.location are wrong, indicating a discrepancy in session history management.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can leverage the spoofed address bar to create convincing phishing attacks, tricking users into entering sensitive information on what appears to be a legitimate website.
*   **Malware Delivery:** A malicious actor could display a legitimate URL while delivering malicious content, such as a drive-by download, since the document location object is incorrect and therefore can’t be used as a reliable security check.
*   **User Confusion and Mistrust:** The discrepancy between the address bar and the content can cause confusion and erode user trust in the browser.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a malicious website that automatically executes JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction (Initially):** The attack can be fully automated, but initially the user had to manually click the back button a few times and then a button on the attacker's page. This was later modified, where no user interaction beyond visiting the attacker's webpage was necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Specific History Navigation:** The exploit relies on a specific sequence of history navigations involving restricted addresses/ports and attacker-controlled pages.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a webpage to start the exploit.
*   **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft JavaScript code to manipulate the browser's history API.
*   **Understanding of Browser Behavior:** A detailed understanding of how Firefox handles session history, specifically with respect to error pages and blocked ports, is necessary.
*   **Targeted Browser:** The exploit was primarily tested on Firefox and affected versions before the fix was implemented.

**Additional Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability occurs when a history chain looks like this: Restricted address -> legitimate address -> Restricted address.
* The exploit involves using `window.open()` to load a restricted address such as <https://google.com:1>, then using `setTimeout` to load an attacker controlled page and then another restricted address such as <https://dontdoit.com:1> into the same tab.
* The `setTimeout` function was used to orchestrate the timing of page loads, essential for the exploit to succeed. The attacker uses `window.history.go()` to navigate back and forward in history which causes confusion between the displayed URL and the content.
* The issue was fixed with [bug 1563587](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1563587) "Make history navigations asynchronous" which changed how history navigations are handled in Firefox.

**Timeline Summary:**

*   **Reported:** The vulnerability was reported by Adrian Karolak and initially involved user interaction, later improved to require no user interaction.
*   **Initial Investigation:**  Mozilla developers tried to reproduce the issue, initially failing to trigger the automated test cases, but succeeded with manual steps.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**  The root cause was identified with respect to how session history is stored when error pages are loaded and how this interacts with the history API.
*   **Fix:** Asynchronous history navigation, introduced with bug 1563587, addressed the issue in Firefox 70.
*   **CVE Assignment:** The issue was officially assigned CVE-2020-12412 and documented in the Mozilla Security Advisory.
*   **Security Advisory:**  The fix was included in Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-34.
