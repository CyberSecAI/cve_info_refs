Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **missing initialization of resources (CWE-909)** within Phoenix Contact mGuard devices that have integrated switches on the LAN side. Specifically, when switch ports are disabled via device configuration, this setting is not properly initialized after a device reboot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Initialization:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly initialize the configured state of the switch ports after a reboot. This leads to disabled ports becoming active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unexpected Data Transmission/Reception:** After a reboot, the affected mGuard devices can unexpectedly receive or transmit data through ports that were configured to be disabled.
*   **Exposure of Administrative Interfaces:** This could lead to the unexpected provision of administrative interfaces on ports that were supposed to be deactivated, potentially exposing the devices to unauthorized access.
*  **Confidentiality and Availability Risks:** Attackers could exploit the unexpected availability of disabled ports to access confidential data or compromise the availability of mGuard services through actions such as flooding or resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a device reboot following the disabling of switch ports via device configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need network access to the affected mGuard device and its LAN.
*  The attacker needs to be aware of the configuration of the disabled switch ports after a reboot to exploit them.
* A user interface interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by causing the device to reboot.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory lists specific affected Phoenix Contact mGuard product models and versions.
*   The vendor recommends upgrading to firmware version 8.8.3 to resolve the vulnerability.
*   A temporary mitigation is suggested: instead of deactivating switch ports via configuration, detach network cables from the affected ports.
