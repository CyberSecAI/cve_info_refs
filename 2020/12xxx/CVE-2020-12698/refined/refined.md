The provided content relates to CVE-2020-12698.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The TYPO3 "Direct Mail" extension (direct\_mail) fails to properly check if an authenticated backend user has access to newsletter subscriber tables (e.g. tt\_address, fe\_users) when using the CSV export function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Broken Access Control: The extension lacks proper access control checks when exporting data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with backend access, even without specific access to newsletter subscriber data, can export data from those tables via the CSV export function, leading to unauthorized data access and information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have authenticated access to the TYPO3 backend.
- The attacker leverages the CSV export functionality of the "Direct Mail" extension to export sensitive data, bypassing access controls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account with backend access to the TYPO3 system.
- No specific privileges are needed other than the ability to access the backend.
