{
  "CVE-2020-12690": {
    "root_cause": "The OAuth1 Token API in OpenStack Keystone was not properly handling the roles specified during the authorization of an OAuth1 access token, leading to privilege escalation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "When creating a keystone token using an OAuth1 access token, the keystone token would inherit all roles of the user who authorized the access token, instead of the specified roles."
    ],
    "impact": "A user could obtain a keystone token with more privileges than intended, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions within the OpenStack environment.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with a valid OAuth1 access token, could request a keystone token, and obtain more role assignments than were originally intended by the user who authorized the OAuth1 access token.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid OAuth1 access token authorized by another user. This implies an authenticated user with the ability to authorize OAuth1 access tokens."
  }
