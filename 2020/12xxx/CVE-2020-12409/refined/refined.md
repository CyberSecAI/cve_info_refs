Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12409:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2020-12409` in the summary of Bug 1629506 and in the Mozilla Security Advisory. The description in the advisory matches the description of the bug report, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the incorrect rendering of the U+2800 (Braille blank) character in the Firefox address bar. Instead of being encoded like other space-like characters, it was displayed as a blank space.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The vulnerability lies in how Firefox's address bar handles and displays the U+2800 character. The browser failed to treat this blank character as a space, allowing it to be rendered as a blank space instead of an encoded value, which can then be combined with other characters to produce a visually misleading URL.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - The primary impact of this vulnerability is URL spoofing. By using U+2800 in conjunction with Right-to-Left (RTL) characters, an attacker could craft a URL that appears to point to a legitimate website but actually leads to a malicious site. This can trick users into visiting phishing sites or other malicious content, similar to CVE-2020-12408, which this bug depends on to be effective.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - An attacker can inject the U+2800 character into a URL path after the domain name. The URL, when displayed in the address bar, can be misleading to the user due to the blank space. This becomes more problematic when combined with RTL characters, as mentioned in comment 3.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the U+2800 character.
   - The attacker needs to be able to distribute the URL to the target user, for example via phishing emails, or other means.
   - For a more effective spoof, the attacker would combine this with RTL characters, and the target will need to be using a vulnerable version of Firefox.

**Additional details:**
  - The issue was initially reported by rayyanh12 as an external reporter.
  - The fix was implemented by treating U+2800 as a space-like character and encoding it in URLs.
  - This bug is related to and depends on CVE-2020-12408, as stated in the bug report, which addresses RTL-based spoofing when the domain is an IP address.
  - The fix was implemented in Firefox 77 and was not backported to earlier versions.
  - The severity is considered "low" by Mozilla's security team. However, Chrome assigned a higher risk rating.
  -  A bounty was awarded for this bug, combined with CVE-2020-12408 and bug 1633225.

In summary, CVE-2020-12409 allowed for URL spoofing through the incorrect handling of the U+2800 character in the Firefox address bar. Attackers could leverage this to create visually misleading URLs, especially when combined with RTL characters. This posed a risk of users being redirected to malicious sites. The fix involved correctly encoding this character, eliminating the possibility of its use in spoofing attacks.
