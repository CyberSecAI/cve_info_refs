Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-12268:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `jbig2_image_compose` function within `jbig2_image.c` in the Artifex jbig2dec library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `jbig2_image_compose` function is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs because it doesn't properly validate the input parameters (x, y, width, height) of the source image, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to:
  - Arbitrary code execution by overwriting heap metadata.
  - Denial of service due to a crash.
  - Partial loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the specific overwrite.
  - Exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted JBIG2 image file containing extreme values for x/y/w/h in `jbig2_image_compose`, which causes an overflow.
- Network-based exploitation is possible.
- User interaction is not required, meaning the vulnerability can be triggered without user awareness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted JBIG2 image to an application using the vulnerable `jbig2dec` library.
- No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by OSS-Fuzz (Google's fuzzing project).
- The fix implemented in jbig2dec v0.18 adds checks to prevent the overflow by validating the input parameters.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), indicating a critical severity. However, SUSE assigned it a CVSS v3 score of 7.3, indicating a lower severity.
- The vulnerability affects multiple SUSE products including SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED), SUSE OpenStack Cloud, SUSE Enterprise Storage, and openSUSE Leap distributions.
- Updates to `ghostscript`, and `libspectre` are used to address this issue in SUSE products.
- The Debian Long Term Support (LTS) team addressed this issue in `jbig2dec` version 0.13-4.1+deb9u1.
