  "cve": "CVE-2020-12863",
  "description": "An out-of-bounds read in SANE Backends before 1.0.30 may allow a malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim to read important information, such as the ASLR offsets of the program, aka GHSL-2020-083.",
  "affected_software": {
    "sane-backends": {
      "versions": [
        "before 1.0.30"
      ]
    }
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `esci2_check_header` function uses `sscanf` to read a number from a message. If the attacker fills the buffer with the character ‘0’, then sscanf will read off the end of the buffer, potentially revealing information.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure, potentially revealing ASLR offsets.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same local network and be able to send crafted packets."
