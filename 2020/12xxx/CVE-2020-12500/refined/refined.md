Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-12500:

**1. Unauthenticated Device Administration (CVE-2020-12500)**

*   **Root Cause:** The "Korenix View" or "Jet View" management program, which communicates with the devices via UDP, does not require authentication by default.  Older versions, "cmd-server2", have no password protection, while newer versions, "jetviewd," may have password options that are not enabled by default. The UDP communication is in plaintext and broadcasted across the subnet.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Authentication:** The management interface can be accessed and controlled without any prior authentication or password check.
    *   **Plaintext UDP Communication:** Sensitive commands and data are transmitted without encryption.
    *   **Broadcast Communication:** Messages are broadcast across the subnet, potentially exposing them to unauthorized devices.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Full Device Control:** An attacker can perform various administrative actions without authentication.
    *   **Configuration Changes:**  Attackers can modify networking settings (IP, netmask, gateway).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can trigger actions that can brick the device, requiring a manual reset.
    *   **Firmware Manipulation:** Attackers can trigger TFTP downloads/uploads to modify firmware/bootloaders.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the subnet where the affected devices are located can send unauthenticated UDP packets to the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable devices.
    *   No authentication or prior knowledge is required other than the device's IP address.

**Summary of the other vulnerabilities mentioned in the provided text:**

*   **CVE-2020-12501 (Backdoor Accounts):**  Hardcoded credentials for various backdoor accounts are present in the firmware.
*   **CVE-2020-12502 (CSRF):** The web interface lacks CSRF protection, enabling attackers to make configuration changes via malicious web pages.
*   **CVE-2020-12503 (Command Injection):**  Authenticated command injection is possible via the web interface's ping functionality.
*   **CVE-2020-12504 (TFTP Actions):**  The unauthenticated TFTP server can be abused to download sensitive files, such as password hashes, or to upload malicious configurations, firmware or bootloader.

**Additional points:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect multiple products from Korenix, Westermo and Pepperl+Fuchs Comtrol, which share a similar firmware base.
*   The vulnerabilities were found by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab on 2020-04-06.
*   The advisory was coordinated by CERT@VDE.
*   Vendor recommends to restrict network access to the devices to only trusted parties/devices/network and other security best practices like a firewall.
*   Fixed versions are available as firmware updates.
