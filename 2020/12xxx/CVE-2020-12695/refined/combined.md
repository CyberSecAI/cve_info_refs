## CallStranger

This script created by Yunus Çadırcı (<https://twitter.com/yunuscadirci>) to check against CallStranger (CVE-2020-12695) vulnerability. An attacker can use this vulnerability for:

* Bypassing DLP for exfiltrating data
* Using millions of Internet-facing UPnP device as source of amplified reflected TCP DDoS / SYN Flood
* Scanning internal ports from Internet facing UPnP devices
  This script only simulates data exfiltration.
  You can find detailed information on <https://www.callstranger.com> <https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/339275> <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12695>
  Slightly modified version of <https://github.com/5kyc0d3r/upnpy> used for base UPnP communication

## CallStranger Vulnerability

The CallStranger vulnerability that is found in billions of UPNP devices can be used to exfiltrate data (even if you have proper DLP/border security means) or scan your network or even cause your network to participate in a DDoS attack.

The vulnerability – CallStranger – is caused by Callback header value in UPnP SUBSCRIBE function can be controlled by an attacker and enables an SSRF-like vulnerability which affects millions of Internet facing and billions of LAN devices. This vulnerability can used for

* Bypassing DLP and network security devices to exfiltrate data
* Using millions of Internet-facing UPnP device as source of amplified reflected TCP DDoS (not same with <https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ssdp-ddos-attack/> )
* Scanning internal ports from Internet facing UPnP devices
  Possible remediations:
* Disable unnecessary UPnP services especially for Internet facing devices/interfaces.
* Check Intranet and server networks to be sure UPnP devices (Routers, IP cameras, printers, media gateways etc.) are not allowing data exfiltration.
* Make an assessment on network security logs if this vulnerability had been used any threat actor.
* Contact to ISP/ DDoS protection vendor if their solutions can block traffic generated by UPnP SUBSCRIBE (HTTP NOTIFY)
  Because this is a protocol vulnerability, it may take a long time for vendors to provide patches. Visit <https://callstranger.com> and <https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/339275> for detailed information, affected devices, software, and to follow updates. CVE-2020-12695 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12695> is assigned to CallStranger.
  OCF updated UPnP specification on 17.04.2020 to remediate this vulnerability. Check new specification on <https://openconnectivity.org/upnp-specs/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v2.0-20200417.pdf>

## Install

```
sudo python3 setup.py install

```

if needed

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

cryptography
requests
termcolor

## Usage

just navigate to CallStranger and run with Python3 (Tested Python 3.7.5 on Windows 10, Python 3.8.2 on Kali 2020.2)
For current subnet scan & test:

```
python3 CallStranger.py

```

For single device test:

```
python3 CallDirect.py http://DeviceDocumentPath

```

example: python3 CallDirect.py <http://192.168.1.1:37215/upnpdev.xml>

## How script works?

1. Finds all UPnP devices on LAN
2. Finds all UPnP services
3. Finds all subscription endpoints
4. Sends these endpoints as encryted to verification server via UPnP Callback.
5. Server can't see this endpoints because all encryption is done on client side
6. Gets encrypted service list from verification server and decrypts on client side
7. Compares found UPnP services with verified ones

## Example Output

 Total 20 service(s) found. do you want to continue to VERIFY if service(s) are vulnerable?
Be careful: This operation needs Internet access and may transfer data about devices over network. Data encrypted on local and we cant see which services are vulnerable but ISPs and other elements may be able to inspect HTTP headers created by UPnP device. Because most of UPnPstack do not allow SSL connection we can not use it.
Do you want to continue? y/N y

Introduction

What is UPnP 1 Technology?

UPnP  technology  defines  an  architecture  for  pervasive  peer-to-peer  network  connectivity  of
intelligent  appliances,  wireless  devices,  and  PCs  of  all  form  factors.  It  is  designed  to  bring
easy-to-use, flexible, standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc or unmanaged networks whether
in the home, in a small business, public spaces, or attached to the Internet. UPnP technology
provides  a  distributed,  open  networking  architecture  that  leverages  TCP/IP  and  Web
technologies  to  enable seamless proximity  networking  in  addition to control and  data  transfer
among networked devices.

The  UPnP  Device  Architecture  (UDA)  is  more  than  just  a  simple  extension  of  the  plug  and
play peripheral model. It is designed to support zero-configuration, "invisible" networking, and
automatic  discovery  for  a  breadth  of  device  categories  from  a  wide  range  of  vendors.  This
means a device can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP address, convey its capabilities,
and  learn  about  the  presence  and  capabilities  of  other  devices.  Finally,  a  device  can  leave  a
network smoothly and automatically without leaving any unwanted state behind.

The  technologies  leveraged  in  the  UPnP  architecture  include  Internet  protocols  such  as  IP,
TCP, UDP, HTTP, and XML. Like the Internet, contracts are based on wire protocols that are
declarative,  expressed  in  XML,  and  communicated  via  HTTP.  Using  Internet  protocols  is  a
strong choice for UDA because of its proven ability to span different physical media, to enable
real  world  multiple-vendor  interoperation,  and  to  achieve  synergy  with  the  Internet  and  many
home  and  office
to
accommodate  these  environments.  Further,  via  bridging,  UDA  accommodates  media  running
non-IP  protocols when cost,  technology,  or  legacy prevents the  media  or  devices attached to
it from running IP.

intranets.  The  UPnP  architecture  has  been  explicitly  designed

What  is  "universal"  about  UPnP  technology?  No  device  drivers;  common  protocols  are  used
instead.  UPnP  networking  is  media  independent.  UPnP  devices  can  be  implemented  using
any  programming  language,  and  on  any  operating  system.  The  UPnP  architecture  does  not
specify  or  constrain  the  design  of  an  API  for  applications;  OS  vendors  may  create  APIs  that
suit their customers’ needs.

UPnP Forum

UPnP  Forum  is  an  industry  initiative  designed  to  enable  easy  and  robust  connectivity  among
stand-alone  devices  and  PCs  from  many  different  vendors.  UPnP  Forum  seeks  to  develop
standards  for  describing  device  protocols  and XML-based  device schemas for  the purpose  of
enabling device-to-device interoperability in a scalable, networked environment.

UPnP  Forum  is  comprised  of  member  companies  across  many  industries  that  promote  the
adoption  of  uniform  technical  device  interconnectivity  standards  and  testing  and certifying  of
these  devices.  The  Forum  develops  and  administers  the  testing  and  certification  process,
administers  the  UPnP  logo  program,  and  provides  information  to  members  and  other
interested  parties  regarding  the  certification  of  UPnP  devices.  The  UPnP  device  certification
process is open to any vendor who is an implementer level member of UPnP Forum, has paid
the implementer dues, and has devices that support UPnP functionality. For more information,
see http://www.upnp.org.

UPnP  Forum  has  set  up  working  committees  in  specific  areas  of  domain  expertise.  These
working  committees  are  charged  with  creating  proposed  device  standards,  building  sample
implementations,  and  building  appropriate  test  suites.  This  document  indicates  specific
technical decisions that are the purview of UPnP Forum working committees.

UPnP  vendors  can  build  compliant  devices  with  confidence  of  interoperability  and  benefits  of
shared  intellectual  property  and  the  logo  program.  Separate  from  the  logo  program,  vendors

may also  build  devices  that  adhere to  the  UPnP  Device  Architecture  defined herein without  a
formal  standards  procedure.  If  vendors  build  non-standard  devices,  they  determine  technical
decisions that would otherwise be determined by a UPnP Forum working committee.

In this document

The  UPnP  Device  Architecture  (formerly  known  as  the  DCP  Framework)  contained  herein
defines  the  protocols  for  communication  between  controllers,  or  control  points,  and  devices.
For  discovery, description, control,  eventing,  and  presentation,  the  UPnP  Device  Architecture
uses  the  following  protocol  stack  (the  indicated  colors  and  type  styles  are  used  thro ughout
this document to indicate where each protocol element is defined):

Figure 1: — Protocol stack

SSDP [blue]

Multicast events [navy-bold]

UDP [black]

IP [black]

SOAP [blue]

GENA [navy-bold]

HTTP [black]  HTTP [black]

TCP [black]

At the  highest  layer,  messages  logically contain  only UPnP vendor-specific information about
their devices. Moving down the stack, vendor content is supplemented by information defined
by  UPnP  Forum  working  committees.  Messages  from  the  layers  above  are  hosted  in  UPnP-
specific  protocols  such  as  the  Simple  Service  Discovery  Protocol  (SSDP),  the  General  Event
Notification  Architecture  (GENA)  and  the  multicast  event  protocol  defined  in  this  document,
and  others  that  are  referenced.  SSDP  is  delivered  via  either  multicast  or  unicast  UDP.
Multicast events are delivered via multicast UDP. GENA is delivered via HTTP. Ultimately, all
messages  above  are  delivered over  IP. The remaining clauses of  this document  describe  the
content and format for each of these protocol layers in detail. For reference, colors in [square
brackets] above indicate which protocol defines specific message components throughout this
document.

Two  general  classifications  of  devices  are  defined  by  the  UPnP  architecture:  controlled
devices (or simply “devices”), and control points. A controlled device functions in the role of a
server, responding to requests from control points. Both control points and controlled devices
can  be  implemented  on  a  variety  of  platforms  including  personal  computers  and  embedded
systems.  Multiple  devices,  control  points,  or  both  may  be  operational  on  the  same  network
endpoint simultaneously.

Note:  This  document  is  oriented  toward  an  IPv4  environment.  Considerations  for  an  IPv6
environment are expressed in Annex A.

The foundation for UPnP networking is IP addressing. In  an IPv4 environment, each device or
control point shall have a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client and search for a
DHCP  server  when  the  device  or  control  point  is  first  connected  to  the  network.  If  a  DHCP
server  is  available,  i.e.,  the  network  is  managed;  the  device  or  control  point  shall  use  the  IP
address  assigned  to  it.  If  no  DHCP  server  is  available,  i.e.,  the  network  is  unmanaged;  the
device  or  control  point  shall  use  Auto  IP  to  get  an  address.  In  brief,  Auto  IP  defines  how  a
device  or  control  point  intelligently  chooses  an  IP  address  from  a  set  of  reserved  addresses
and  is  able  to  move  easily  between  managed  and  unmanaged  networks.  If  during  the  DHCP
transaction, the device or control point obtains a domain name, e.g., through a DNS server or
via  DNS  forwarding,  the  device  or  control  point  should  use  that  name  in  subsequent  network
operations; otherwise, the device or control point should use its IP address.

Certain UPnP networks have more complex configurations such as multiple physical networks
and/or  multiple  logical  networks  to  accommodate  multiple  non-overlapping  addressing
schemes.  Devices  and  control  points  may  also  have  two  or  more  network  interfaces,  and/or
two  or  more IP  addresses assigned to each  interface. In such configurations,  a single device
or  control  point  may  be  assigned  multiple  IP  addresses  from  different  logical  networks  in  the
same  UPnP  network,  resulting  in  devices  appearing  to  a  control  point  multiple  times  in  the
network.  Devices  and  control  points  that  have  multiple  IP  addresses  on  the  same  UPnP
network  are  referred  to  as  multi-homed.  Throughout  this  document,  the  term  "UPnP-enabled
interface"  is  used  to  refer  to  an  interface  which  is  assigned  an  IP  address  belonging  to  the
UPnP network. Additional behaviors specific to multi-homed devices and control points will be
covered  in  applicable  clauses  throughout  the  document.  However,  as  a  general  principle,
related  interactions  between  control  points  and  devices  (e.g.  action  control  request  and
response messages, event subscription and event messages) shall occur using the same pair
of outgoing and incoming UPnP-enabled interfaces.

Given an IP address, Step 1 in UPnP networking is discovery. When a device is added to the
network,  the  UPnP  discovery  protocol  allows  that  device  to  advertise  its  services  to  control
points  on  the  network.  Similarly,  when  a  control  point  is  added  to  the  network,  the  UPnP
discovery  protocol  allows  that  control  point  to  search  for  devices  of  interest  on  the  network.
The  fundamental  exchange  in  both  cases  is  a  discovery  message  containing  a  few  essential
specifics about the device or one of its services, e.g., its type, identifier, and a pointer to more
detailed  information.  The  clause  on  Discovery  below  explains  how  devices  advertise,  how
control points search, and contains details about the format of discovery messages.

Step  2  in  UPnP  networking  is  description.  After  a  control  point  has  discovered  a  device,  the
control  point still knows  very  little  about the  device. For  the control  point  to learn  more about
the device and its capabilities, or to interact with the device, the control point shall retrieve the
device's  description  from  the  URL  provided  by  the  device  in  the  discovery  message.  Devices
may  contain  other  logical  devices,  as  well  as  functional  units,  or  services.  The  UPnP
description  for  a  device  is  expressed  in  XML  and  includes  vendor-specific  manufacturer
information  like  the  model  name  and  number,  the  serial  number,  the  manufacturer  name,
URLs to vendor-specific Web sites, etc. The description also includes a list of any embedded
devices or services, as well as URLs for control, eventing, and presentation. For each service,
the  description  includes  a  list  of  the  commands,  or  actions ,  to  which  the  service  responds,
and parameters, or arguments for each action; the description for a service also includes a list
of  variables;  these  variables  model  the  state  of  the  service  at  run  time,  and  are  described  in
terms  of  their  data  type,  range,  and  event  characteristics.  The  clause  on  Description  below
explains how devices are described and how control points retrieve those descriptions.

Step  3  in  UPnP  networking  is  control.  After  a  control  point  has  retrieved  a  description  of  the
device,  the  control  point  can  send  actions  to  a  device's  services.  To  do  this,  a  control  point
sends  a  suitable  control  message  to  the  control  URL  for  the  service (provided  in  the  device
description).  Control  messages  are  also  expressed  in  XML  using  the  Simple  Object  Access
Protocol  (SOAP).  Like  function  calls,  in  response  to  the  control  message,  the  service  returns
any  action-specific  values.  The  effects  of  the  action,  if  any,  are  modeled  by  changes  in  the
variables that describe the run-time state of the service. The clause on Control below explains
the description of actions, state variables, and the format of control messages.

Step  4  in  UPnP  networking  is  eventing.  A  UPnP  description  for  a  service  includes  a  list  of
actions  the  service  responds  to  and  a  list  of  variables  that  model  the  state  of  the  service  at
run  time.  The  service  publishes  updates  when  these  variables  change,  and  a  control  point
may  subscribe  to  receive  this  information.  The  service  publishes  updates  by  sending  event
messages. Event messages contain the names of one or more state variables and the current
value  of  those  variables.  These  messages  are  also  expressed  in  XML.  A  special initial  event
message is sent when a control point first subscribes; this event message contains the names
and  values  for  all  evented  variables  and  allows  the  subscriber  to  initialize  its  model  of  the
state of the service. To support scenarios with multiple control points, eventing is designed to
keep  all  control  points  equally  informed  about  the  effects  of  any  action.  Therefore,  all
subscribers are sent all event messages, subscribers receive event messages for all evented

variables  that  have  changed,  and  event  messages  are  sent  no  matter  why  the  state  variable
changed  (either  in  response  to  a  requested  action  or  because  the  state  the  service  is
modeling  changed).  Multicast  eventing  is  a  variant  of  Step  4  in  UPnP  networking.  Through
multicast eventing, control points can listen to state changes in services without subscription.
This  form  of  eventing  is  useful  first  when  events  which  are  not  relevant  to  specific  UPnP
interactions  should  be  delivered  to  control  points  to  inform  users,  and  second  when  multiple
controlled devices want to inform multiple other control points. Multicast eventing is inherently
unreliable  since  it  is  based  on  UDP.  To  increase  the  probability  of  successful  transmission,
the  option  to  retransmit  multicast  event  notifications  is  outlined.  UPnP  Working  committees
should  define  whether  specific  events  are  multicast  events.  The  clause  on  Eventing  below
explains  unicast  event  subscription  and  the  format  of  both  unicast  and  multicast  event
messages.

Step  5  in  UPnP  networking  is presentation.  If  a  device  has  a  URL  for  presentation,  then  the
control point can retrieve a page from this URL, load the page into a browser, and depending
on  the  capabilities  of  the  page,  allow  a  user  to  control  the  device  and/or  view  device  status.
The degree to which each of these can be accomplished depends on the specific capabilities
of  the presentation  page and device. The clause  on  Presentation below  explains the  protocol
for retrieving a presentation page.

Audience

The audience for this document includes UPnP device and control point vendors, members of
UPnP  Forum  working  committees,  and  anyone  else  who  has  a  need  to  understanding  the
technical details of UPnP protocols.

This  document  assumes  the  reader  is  familiar  with  the  HTTP,  TCP,  UDP,  IP  family  of
protocols;  this  document  makes  no  attempt  to  explain  them.  This  document  also  assumes
most  readers  will  be  new  to  XML,  and  while  it  is  not  an  XML  tutorial,  XML-related  issues  are
addressed  in  detail  given  the  centrality  of  XML  to  the  UPnP  Device  Architecture.  This
document makes no assumptions about the reader's understanding of various programming or
scripting languages.

0  Addressing

Addressing is Step 0 of UPnP networking. Through addressing, devices and control points get
a  network  address.  Addressing  enables  discovery  (Step  1)  where  control  points  find
interesting device(s), description (Step 2) where control points learn about device capabilities,
control (Step 3) where a control point sends commands to device(s), eventing (Step 4) where
control  points  listen  to  state  changes  in  device(s),  and  presentation  (Step  5)  where  control
points display a user interface for device(s).

The  foundation  for  UPnP  networking  is  IP  addressing.  A  UPnP  device  or  control  point  is
allowed  to  support  IP  version  4-only,  or  both  IP  version  4  and  IP  version  6.  This  clause,  and
the  examples  given  throughout  clauses  1  through  5  of  this  document,  assumes  an  IPv4
implementation.  Annex  A  of  this  document  describes  IPv6  operation.  Each  UPnP  device  or
control  point  which  does  not  itself  implement  a  DHCP  server  shall  have  a  Dynamic  Host
Configuration  Protocol  (DHCP)  client  and  search  for  a  DHCP  server  when  the  device  or
control point is first connected to the network (if the device or control point itself implements a
DHCP server, it allowed to allocate itself an address from the pool that it controls). If a DHCP
server  is  available,  i.e.,  the  network  is  managed;  the  device  or  control  point  shall  use  the  IP
address  assigned  to  it.  If  no  DHCP  server  is  available,  i.e.,  the  network  is  unmanaged;  the
device or control point shall use automatic IP addressing (Auto-IP) to obtain an address.

Auto-IP (defined  in  RFC  3927)  defines  how a device  or control point: (a)  determines  if DHCP
is  unavailable,  and  (b)  intelligently  chooses  an  IP  address  from  a  set  of  link -local  IP
addresses.  This  method  of  address  assignment  enables  a  device  or  control  point  to  easily
move between managed and unmanaged networks.

— 16 —

This clause provides an overview of the basic operation of Auto-IP. The operations described
in  this  clause  are  detailed  and  clarified  in  the  reference  documents  listed  below.  Where
conflicts  between  this  document  and  the  reference  documents  exist,  the  reference  document
always takes precedence.

0.1  Determining whether to use Auto-IP

A  device  or  control  point  that  supports  Auto-IP  and  is  configured  for  dynamic  address
assignment begins by requesting an IP address via DHCP by sending out a DHCPDISCOVER
message.  The  amount  of  time  this  DHCP  Client  listens  for  DHCPOFFERs  is  implementation
dependent.  If  a  DHCPOFFER  is  received  during  this  time,  the  device  or  control  point  shall
continue the process of dynamic address assignment. If no valid DHCPOFFERs are received,
the device or control point shall then auto-configure an IP address using Auto- IP.

0.2  Choosing an address

To  auto-configure  an  IP  address  using  Auto-IP,  the  device  or  control  point  uses  an
implementation  dependent  algorithm  for  choosing  an  address  in  the  169.254/16  range.  The
first and last 256 addresses in this range are reserved and shall NOT be used.

The selected address shall then be tested to determine if the address is already in use. If the
address  is  in  use  by  another  device  or  control  point,  another  address  shall  be  chosen  and
tested,  up to  an  implementation dependent  number of retries.  The  address  selection  shall  be
randomized  to  avoid  collision  when  multiple  devices  or  control  points  are  attempting  to
allocate  addresses.  The  device  or  control  point  chooses  an  address  using  a  pseudo-random
algorithm  (distributed  over  the  entire  address  range  from  169.254.1.0  to  169.254.254.255)  to
minimize  the  likelihood  that  devices  or  control  points  that  join  the  network  at  the  same  time
will  choose  the  same  address  and  subsequently  choose  alternative  addresses  in  the  same
sequence  when  collisions  are  detected.  This  pseudo-random  algorithm  should  be  seeded
using the device’s or control point’s Ethernet hardware MAC address.

0.3

Testing the address

To  test  the  chosen  address,  the  device  or  control  point  shall  use  an  Address  Resolution
Protocol  (ARP)  probe.  An  ARP  probe  is  an  ARP  request  with  the  device  or  control  point
hardware address used as the sender's hardware address and the sender's IP address set to
0s. The device or control point shall then listen for responses to the ARP probe, or other ARP
probes for the same IP address. If either of these  ARP packets is seen, the device or control
point shall consider the address in use and try a different address. The ARP probe is allowed
to be repeated for greater certainty that the address is not already in use; it is recommended
that the probe be sent four times at two-second intervals.

After  successfully  configuring  a  link-local  address,  the  device  or  control  point shall  send  two
gratuitous  ARPs,  spaced  two  seconds  apart,  this  time  filling  in  the  sender  IP  address.  The
purpose  of  these  gratuitous  ARPs  is  to  make  sure  that  other  hosts  on  the  net  do  not  have
stale  ARP  cache  entries  left  over  from  some  other  host  that  may  previously  have  been  using
the same address.

Devices and control points that are equipped with persistent storage are allowed to record the
IP  address  they  have  selected  and  on  the  next  boot  use  that  address  as  their  first  candidate
when  probing,  in  order  to  increase  the  stability  of  addresses  and  reduce  the  need  to  resolve
address conflicts.

Address  collision  detection  is  not  limited  to  the  address  testing  phase,  when  the  device  or
control point is sending ARP probes and listening for replies. Address collision detection is an
ongoing process that is in effect for as long as the device or control point is using a  link-local
address.  At  any  time,  if  a  device  or  control  point  receives  an  ARP  packet  with  its  own  IP
address given as the sender IP address, but a sender hardware address that does not match
its  own  hardware  address,  then  the  device  or  control  point  shall  treat  this  as  an  address
collision and shall respond as described in either a) or b) below:

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 17 —

a)  Immediately configure a new link-local IP address as described above; or,

b)  If  the  device  or  control  point  currently  has  active  TCP  connections  or  other  reasons  to
prefer  to  keep  the  same  IP  address,  and  has  not  seen  any  other  conflicting  ARP  packets
recently  (e.g.,  within  the  last  ten  seconds)  then  it  is  allowed  to  elect  to  attempt  to  defend
its address once, by recording the time that the conflicting ARP packet was received, and
then  broadcasting  one  single  gratuitous  ARP,  giving  its  own  IP  and  hardware  addresses
as  the  source  addresses  of  the  ARP.  However,  if  another  conflicting  ARP  packet  is
received within a short time after that (e.g., within ten seconds) then the  device or control
point shall immediately configure a new Auto-IP address as described above.

The device or control point shall respond to conflicting ARP packets as described in either a)
or  b)  above;  it  shall  NOT  ignore  conflicting  ARP  packets.  If  a  new  address  is  selected,  the
device  or  control  point  shall  cancel  previous  advertisements  and  re-advertise  with  the  new
address.

After  successfully  configuring  an  Auto-IP  address,  all  subsequent  ARP  packets  (replies  as
well  as  requests)  containing  an  Auto-IP  source  address  shall  be  sent  using  link-level
broadcast  instead  of  link-level  unicast,  in  order  to  facilitate  timely  detection  of  duplicate
addresses.

0.4

Forwarding rules

IP packets whose source or destination addresses are  in  the  169.254/16 range shall NOT  be
sent  to  any  router  for  forwarding.  Instead,  the  senders shall  ARP  for  the  destination  address
and  then  send  the  packets  directly  to  the  destination  on  the  same  link.  IP  datagrams  with  a
multicast  destination  address  and  an  Auto-IP  source  address shall  NOT  be  forwarded  off  the
local  link.  Devices  and  control  points  are  allowed  to  assume  that  all  169.254/16  destination
addresses  are  on-link  and  directly  reachable.  The  169.254/16  address  range  shall  not  be
subnetted.

0.5

Periodic checking for dynamic address availability

A  device  or  control  point  that  has  auto-configured  an  IP  address  shall  periodically  check  for
the  existence  of  a  DHCP  server.  This  is  accomplished  by  sending  DHCPDISCOVER
messages.  How  often  this  check  is  made  is  implementation  dependent,  but  checking  every  5
minutes  would  maintain  a  balance  between  network  bandwidth  required  and  connectivity
maintenance.  If  a  DHCPOFFER  is  received,  the  device  or  control  point  shall  proceed  with
dynamic address allocation. Once a DHCP assigned address is in place, the device or control
point  is  allowed  to  release  the  auto-configured  address,  but  is  also  allowed  to  choose  to
maintain this address for a period of time (or indefinitely) to maintain connectivity.

To  switch  over  from  one  IP  address  to  a  new  one,  the  device  should,  if  possible,  cancel  any
outstanding  advertisements  made  on
issue  new
advertisements  on  the  new  address.  The  clause  on  Discovery  explains  advertisements  and
their cancellations. In addition, any event subscriptions are deleted by the device (see clause
on Eventing).

the  previous  address  and  shall

For  a  multi-homed  device  with  multiple  IP  addresses,  to  switch  one  of  the  IP  addresses  to  a
new  one,  the  device should  cancel  any  outstanding  advertisements  made  on  the  previous  IP
address,  and  shall  issue  new  advertisements  on  the  new  IP  addresses.  Furthermore,  it  shall
also  issue  appropriate  update  advertisements  on  all  unaffected  IP  addresses.  The  clause  on
Discovery  explains  advertisements,  their  cancellations  and  updates.  The  clause  on  Eventing
explains the effect on event subscriptions.

0.6  Device naming and DNS interaction

Once a device has a valid IP address for the network, it can be located and referenced on that
network  through  that  address.  There  may  be  situations  where  the  end  user  needs  to  locate
and  identify  a  device.  In these  situations,  a  friendly  name  for  the  device  is  much  easier  for  a
human  to  use  than  an  IP  address.  If  a  device  chooses  to  provide  a  host  name  to  a  DHCP

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 18 —

server  and  register  with  a  DNS  server,  the  device  should  either  ensure  the  requested  host
name  is  unique  or  provide  a  means  for  the  user  to  change  the  requested  host  name.  Most
often,  devices  do  not  provide  a  host  name,  but  provide  URLs  using  literal  (numeric)  IP
addresses.

Moreover, names are much more static than IP addresses. Clients referring a device by name
don't  require  any  modification  when  the  IP  address  of  a  device  changes.  Mapping  of  the
device's  DNS  name  to  its  IP  address  could  be  entered  into  the  DNS  database  manually  or
dynamically  according  to  RFC  2136.  While  devices  supporting  dynamic  DNS  updates  can
register their DNS records directly in the DNS, it is also possible to configure a DHCP server
to register DNS records on behalf of these DHCP clients.

0.7  Name to IP address resolution

A device that needs to contact another device identified by a DNS name needs to discover its
IP  address.  The  device  submits  a  DNS  query  according  to  RFC1034  and  1035  to  the  pre-
configured  DNS  server(s)  and  receives  a  response  from  a  DNS  server  containing  the  IP
address  of  the  target  device.  A  device  can  be  statically  pre-configured  with  the  list  of  DNS
servers. Alternatively a device could be configured with the list of DNS server through DHCP,
or after the address assignment through a DHCPINFORM message.

1  Discovery

Discovery  is  Step 1  in UPnP™ networking. Discovery comes after  addressing (Step  0)  where
devices  get  a  network  address.  Through  discovery,  control  points  find  interesting  device(s).
Discovery  enables  description  (Step  2)  where  control  points  learn  about  device  capabilities,
control (Step 3) where a control point sends commands to device(s), eventing (Step 4) where
control  points  listen  to  state  changes  in  device(s),  and  presentation  (Step  5)  where  control
points display a user interface for device(s).

Discovery  is  the  first  step  in  UPnP  networking.  When  a  device  is  added  to  the  network,  the
UPnP  discovery  protocol  allows  that  device  to  advertise  its  services  to  control  points  on  the
network. Similarly, when a control point is added to the network, the UPnP discovery protocol
allows  that  control  point  to  search  for  devices  of  interest  on  the  network.  The  fundamental
exchange  in  both  cases  is  a  discovery  message  containing  a  few,  essential  specifics  about
the device or one of its services, e.g., its type, universally unique identifier, a pointer to more
detailed information and optionally parameters that identify the current state of the device.

When  a  device  knows  it  is  newly  added  to  the  network,  it  shall  multicast  a  number  of
discovery  messages  advertising  itself,  its  embedded  devices,  and  its  services  (initial
announce).  Any  interested  control  point  can  listen  to  the  standard  multicast  address  for
notifications  that  new  capabilities  are  available.  A  multi-homed  device  shall  multicast  the
discovery messages on all UPnP-enabled interfaces. A multi-homed control point is allowed to
listen to the standard multicast address on one, some or all of its UPnP-enabled interfaces.

When  a  new  control  point  is  added  to  the  network,  it  is  allowed  to  multicast  a  discovery
message  searching  for  interesting  devices,  services,  or  both.  All  devices  shall  listen  to  the
standard multicast address for these messages and shall respond if any of their root devices,
embedded  devices  or  services  matches  the  search  criteria  in  the  discovery  message.  In
addition, a control point is allowed to unicast a discovery message to  a specific IP address on
port  1900  or  on  the  port  specified  by  the  optional  SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG  header  field
(which  supersedes  port  1900  for  this  use),  searching  for  a  UPnP  device  or  service  at  that
specific IP address. This action presumes the control point already knows the device at this IP
address  is  a  UPnP    device  (which  listens  on  the  appropriate  port).  The  control  point  can  use
unicast  search  for  a  number  of  applications.  A  unicast  search  can  quickly  confirm  a  specific
device  and  provide  the  corresponding  discovery  information  (e.g.  UUID,  URL)  of  this  device.

All devices shall listen to incoming unicast search messages on port 1900 or, if provided, the
port number specified in the SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG header field and shall respond if any
of  their  root  devices,  embedded  devices  or  services  matches  the  search  criteria  in  the
discovery message.

A multi-homed control point is allowed to multicast discovery messages on one, some or all of
its  UPnP-enabled  interfaces.  Multi-homed  devices  shall  listen  to  the  standard  multicast
address  on  all  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  for  multicast  discovery  messages.  Multi-homed
devices  shall  also  listen  to  incoming  unicast  search  messages  on  port  1900  or,  if  provided,
the  port  number  specified  in  the  SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG  header  field.  The  devices  shall
respond  if  any  of  their  root  devices,  embedded  devices  or  services  matches  the  search
criteria in the discovery message.

To reiterate, a control point is allowed to learn of a device of interest because that device sent
discovery  messages  advertising  itself  or  because  the  device  responded  to  a  discovery
message searching  for  devices. In  either case,  if  a control point  is interested  in  a  device and
wants to learn more about it, the control point uses the information in the discovery message
to  send  a  description  query  message.  The  clause  on  Description  explains  description
messages in detail.

When  a  device  is  removed  from  the  network,  it  should,  if  possible,  multicast  a  number  of
discovery  messages  revoking  its  earlier  announcements,  effectively  declaring  that  its  root
devices, embedded  devices  and services will  no  longer  be  available.  When the IP  address  of
a  device  is  changed,  it should revoke  any  earlier  announcements  and  it shall advertise using
the new IP address.

When a  multi-homed device  becomes  unavailable to  the network on any  of  its  UPnP-enabled
interfaces, it should, if possible, multicast a number of discovery messages revoking its earlier
announcements  on  the  affected  UPnP-enabled  interfaces,  effectively  declaring  that  its  root
devices,  embedded  devices  and  services  will  no  longer  be  available  on  those  interfaces.  If  it
remains  available  to  the  network  on  any  of  its  other  UPnP-enabled  interfaces,  it  shall  NOT
multicast such discovery messages on the unaffected UPnP-enabled interfaces.

Finally,  if  a  multi-homed  device  loses connectivity on one  of  its UPnP-enabled  interfaces  and
then  regains  connectivity,  it  shall  increase  its  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value  (see  1.2,
“Advertisement”),  and  multicast  a  number  of  update  messages  on  the  unaffected  UPnP-
enabled interfaces to announce the new BOOTID.UPNP.ORG field value. After all the update
messages have been sent, it shall multicast a number of discovery messages on all (affected
and unaffected) UPnP-enabled interfaces with the new BOOTID.UPNP.ORG field value.

To  limit  network  congestion,  the  time-to-live  (TTL)  of  each  IP  packet  for  each  multicast
message should  default to 2 and should  be configurable. When the TTL is greater than 1, it is
possible  for  multicast  messages  to  traverse  multiple  routers;  therefore  control  points  and
devices  using  non-AutoIP  addresses  shall  send  an  IGMP  Join  message  so  that  routers  will

— 21 —

forward  multicast  messages  to  them  (this  is  not  necessary  when  using  an  Auto-IP  address,
since packets with Auto-IP addresses will not be forwarded by routers).

Versioning:  Discovery  plays  an  important  role  in  the  interoperability  of  devices  and  control
points  using  different  versions  of  UPnP  networking.  The  UPnP  Device  Architecture  (defined
herein)  is  versioned  with  both  a  major  and  a  minor  version,  usually  written  as  major.minor,
where  both  major  and  minor  are  integers  (for  example,  version  2.10  [two  dot  ten]  is  newer
than version 2.2 [two dot two]). Advances in minor versions shall be a compatible superset of
earlier minor versions of the same major version. Advances in major version are not required
to  be  supersets  of  earlier  versions  and  are  not  guaranteed  to  be  backward  compatible.
However  UDA  version  2.0  is  specified  as  a  superset  of  UDA  1.1  and  is  thus  backwards
compatible  with  UDA  1.x  versions.  Therefore  UDA  2.0  control  points  shall  maintain
interoperability with UDA 1.x devices. UDA 1.x control points can work with UDA 2.0 devices,
but  can’t  access  the  additional  functionality  specified  in  UDA  2.0.  Version  information  is
communicated  in  discovery  and  description  messages.  Discovery  messages  include  the
version  of  UPnP  networking  that  the  devices  and  control  points  support  (in  the  SERVER  and
USER-AGENT  header  fields);  the  version  of  device  and  service  types  supported  is  also
included in relevant discovery messages. Additionally, description documents also include the
same  information.  SERVER  and  USER-AGENT  header  fields  are  also  used  in  control  and
eventing  to  communicate  which  version  of  UPnP  networking  the  devices  and  control  points
support.  This  clause  explains  the  format  of  version  information  in  discovery  messages  and
specific requirements on discovery messages to maintain compatibility with advances in minor
versions.

The  remainder  of  this clause   explains  the  UPnP  discovery  protocol  known  as  SSDP  (Simple
Service  Discovery  Protocol)  in  detail,  enumerating  how  devices  advertise  and  revoke  their
advertisements as well as how control points search and devices respond.

1.1

SSDP message format

SSDP uses part of the header field format of HTTP 1.1 as defined in RFC 2616. However, it is
NOT  based  on  full  HTTP  1.1  as  it  uses  UDP  instead  of  TCP,  and  it  has  its  own  processing
rules. This subclause defines the generic format of a SSDP message.

All SSDP messages shall be formatted according to RFC 2616  clause 4.1 “generic message”.
SSDP messages shall have a start-line and a list of message header fields. SSDP messages
should  not  have  a  message  body.  If  a  SSDP  message  is  received  with  a  message  body,  the
message body is allowed to be ignored.

1.1.1

SSDP Start-line

Each  SSDP  message  shall  have  exactly  one  start-line.  See  clause  1.2,  “Advertisement”  and
clause  1.3,  “Search”  below  for  the  definition  of  all  possible  SSDP  messages.  The  start-line
shall  be  formatted  either  as  defined  in  RFC  2616 clause  5.1  or  clause  6.1.  Furthermore,  the
start-line shall be one of the following three:

NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1\r\n
M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1\r\n
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n

As a clarification, while the start-line shall include “HTTP/1.1”, this does not signal that SSDP
is  fully  based  on  HTTP  1.1;  this  start-line  element  is  included  for  backward  compatibility
reasons only.

1.1.2

SSDP message header fields

The  message  header  fields  in  a  SSDP  message  shall  be  formatted  according  to  RFC  2616
clause  4.2.  This  specifies  that  each message  header  field  consist  of  a  case-insensitive  field
name  followed  by  a  colon  (":"),  followed  by  the  case-sensitive  field  value.  SSDP  restricts
allowed field values.

Example SSDP header:

1.1.3

SSDP header field extensions

UPnP  working  committees  and  UPnP  vendors  are  allowed  to  extend  SSDP  messages  with
additional  SSDP  header  fields.  Additional message  header  fields  can  also  be  defined  by  the

  myheader.philips.com: “some value”
  myheader.sony.com: “other value”

1.1.4

UUID format and recommended generation algorithms

UPnP  2.0  devices  shall  format  UUIDs  according  to  the  format  specified  below.  However,
UPnP  2.0  control  points  shall  also  be  able  to  accept  UUIDs  that  have  not  been  formatted
according to the rules specified below, as formatting rules are not specified in UPnP 1.0 other
than the requirement that a UUID is a string.

UUIDs  are  128  bit  numbers  that  shall  be  formatted  as  specified  by  the  following  grammar
(taken from [1]):

UUID = 4 * <hexOctet> “-” 2 * <hexOctet> “-” 2 * <hexOctet> “-” 2 * <hexOctet> “-” 6 * <hexOctet
hexOctet = <hexDigit> <hexDigit>
hexDigit = “0”|“1”|“2”|“3”|“4”|“5”|“6”|“7”|“8”|“9”|“a”|“b”|“c”|“d”|“e”|“f”|“A”|“B”|“C”|“D”|“E”|“F”

The following is an example of the string representation of a UUID:

“2fac1234-31f8-11b4-a222-08002b34c003”

UUIDs are allowed to be generated using any suitable generation algorithm 2 that satisfies the
following requirements:

a)  It is very unlikely to duplicate a UUID generated from some other resource.

b)  It maps down to a 128-bit number.

c)  UUIDs shall remain fixed over time.

The following UUID generation algorithm is recommended:

Time  &  MAC-based  algorithm  as  specified  in  [1],  where  the  UUID  is  generated  once  and
stored in non-volatile memory if available.

1.1.5

SSDP processing rules

When  an  SSDP  message  is  received  that  is  not  formatted  according  to  clause  1.1,  “SSDP
message  format”  (the  clauses  above),  receivers  should  silently  discard  the  message.
Receivers are allowed to try to parse such SSDP messages to try to interoperate.

2 The  UUID  generation  algorithm  specified  in  [1]  is  RECOMMENDED,  but  is  not  MANDATORY,
other  UUID  generation  algorithms  may  be  used  instead,  as  long  as  they  satisfy  the  three
requirements.

When  parsing  SSDP  header  fields,  receivers  shall  parse  all  required  SSDP-defined  header
fields  (see  clause  1.2,  “Advertisement”  and  clause  1.3,  “Search”  below)  and  are  allowed  to
skip  all  other  header  fields.  Receivers  shall  be  able  to  skip  header  fields  they  do  not
understand.

this  by  multicasting  discovery  messages

When a device is added to the network, the device advertises its services to control points. It
to  a  standard  address  and  port
does
(239.255.255.250:1900).  Control  points  listen  to  this  port  to  detect  when  new  capabilities  are
available  on  the  network.  To  advertise  the  full  extent  of  its  capabilities,  a  device  shall
multicast  a  number  of  discovery  messages  corresponding  to  each  of  its  root  devices,
embedded  devices  and  services.  Each  message  contains  information  specific  to  the
embedded  device  (or  service)  as  well  as  information  about  its  enclosing  device.  Messages
shall  include  duration  until  the  advertisements  expire;  if  the  device  remains  available,  the
advertisements  shall  be  re-sent  (with  new  duration).  If  the  device  becomes  unavailable,  the
device  should  explicitly  cancel  its  advertisements,  but  if  the  device  is  unable  to  do  this,  the
advertisements  will  expire  on  their  own.  If  a  multi-homed  device  becomes  unavailable  on
some,  but  not  all,  of  its  UPnP-enabled  interfaces,  the  device  should  explicitly  cancel  its
advertisements  on  the  affected  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  (but  NOT  on  the  unaffected  UPnP-
enabled  interfaces),  but  if  the  device  is  unable  to  do  this,  the  advertisements  on  those
interfaces  or  IP  addresses  will  expire  on  their  own.  In  addition,  messages  include  the
following
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG,
NEXTBOOTID.UPNP.ORG,  CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG,  SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG.  The  field
value of the BOOTID.UPNP.ORG header field shall be increased each time a device (re)joins
the  network  and  sends  an  initial  announce  (a  “reboot”  in  UPnP  terms),  or  adds  a  UPnP-
the
enabled
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value  using  an  SSDP  message,  as  long  as  the  device  remains
continuously available in the network, the same BOOTID.UPNP.ORG field value shall be used
in  all  repeat  announcements,  search  responses,  update  messages  and  eventually  bye-bye
messages.  Control  points  can  parse  this  header  field  to  detect  whether  the  device  has
potentially lost its state (event subscriptions will have been lost, DCP specific state may have
been  changed)  due  to  a  “reboot”.  Since  a  device  cannot  change  IP  addresses  wit hout
changing  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value,  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value  can  also
be  used  to  distinguish  multi-homed  devices  (in  this  case,  a  control  point  will  see  SSDP
messages  from  different  IP  addresses  with  the  same  UUID,  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value)
from devices that changed IP addresses (in this case, the BOOTID.UPNP.ORG field value will
be different).  The  field value  of the NEXTBOOTID.UPNP.ORG  header  field  indicates  the  field
value  of  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  header  field  that  a  multi-homed  device  intends  to  use  in
future  announcements  after  adding  a  new  UPnP-enabled  interface.  The  field  value  of  the
CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG  header
the  current  set  of  device  and  service
descriptions;  control  points  can  parse  this  header  field  to  detect  whether  they  need  to  send
new  description  query  messages.  The  field  value  of  the  SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG  header
field  identifies  the  port  at  which  the  device  listens  to  unicast  M-SEARCH  messages;  control
points  can  parse  this  header  field  to  know  to  which  port  unicast  M-SEARCH  messages  shall
be sent. These header fields are explained in detail below.

Advertisement protocols and standards

To  send  (and  receive)  advertisements,  devices  (and  control  points)  use  the  following  subset
of the overall UPnP protocol stack. (The overall UPnP protocol stack is listed at the beginning
of this document.)

SSDP [blue]

At  the  highest  layer,  discovery  messages  contain  vendor-specific  information,  e.g.,  URL  for
the  device  description  and  device  identifier.  Moving  down  the  stack,  vendor  content  is
supplemented  by  information  from  a  UPnP  Forum  working  committee,  e.g.,  device  type.
Messages  from  the  layers  above  are  hosted  in  UPnP-specific  protocols,  defined  in  this
document.  In  turn,  the  SSDP  messages  are  delivered  via  UDP  over  IP.  For  reference,  colors
in  [square  brackets]  above  indicate  which  protocol  defines  specific  header  fields  and  field
values in discovery messages listed below.

1.2.2

Device available - NOTIFY with ssdp:alive

When a device is added to the network, it shall multicast discovery messages to advertise its
root device, any embedded devices, and any services. Each discovery message shall contain
four major components:

a)  A notification type (e.g., device type), sent in an NT (Notification Type) header field.

b)  A composite identifier for the advertisement, sent in a USN (Unique Service Name) header

field.

c)  A URL for more information about the device (or enclosing device in the case of a service),

sent in a LOCATION header field.

d)  A duration for which the advertisement is valid, sent in a CACHE-CONTROL header field.

To advertise its capabilities, a device multicasts a number of discovery messages. Specifically,
a root device shall multicast:

•  Three discovery messages for the root device.

description.

If a root device has d embedded devices and s embedded services but only k distinct service
types,  this  works  out  to  3+2d+k  requests.  If  a  particular  device  or  embedded  device  contains
multiple  instances  of  a  particular  service  type,  it  is  only  necessary  to  advertise  the  service
type  once  (rather  than  once  for  each  instance).  Note  that  if  two  embedded  devices  contain  a
service  of  the  same  service  type,  these  services  shall  still  be  separately  announced.  This
advertises  the  full  extent  of  the  device's  capabilities  to  interested  control  points.  These
messages  shall  be  sent  out  as  a  series  with  roughly  comparable  expiration  times;  order  is
unimportant, but refreshing or canceling individual messages is PROHIBITED.

Updated  UPnP  device  and  service  types  are  required  to  be  fully  backward  compatible  with
previous  versions  of  the  same  type.  Devices  shall  advertise  the  highest  supported version  of
each  supported  type.  For  example,  if  a  device  supports  version  2  of  the  “Audio”  service,  it
would advertise only version 2, even though it also supports version 1. It  shall NOT advertise
additional  supported  versions.  Control  points  that  support  a  given  version  of  a  device  or
service  are  able  to  also  interact  with  higher  versions  because  of  this  backward  compatibility
requirement,  but  only  using  the  functionality  that  was  defined  in  the  lower  version.  For
example,  if  a  control  point  supports  only  version  “1”  of  the  “Audio”  service,  and  a  device
advertises that it supports version “2” of the “Audio” service, the control point shall recognize
the device and be able to use it.

Choosing  an  appropriate  duration  for  advertisements  is  a  balance  between  minimizing
network  traffic  and  maximizing  freshness  of  device  status.  Relatively  short  durations  close  to
the minimum of 1800 seconds will ensure that control points have current device status at the
expense of additional network traffic; longer durations, say on the order of a day, compromise
freshness  of  device  status  but  can  significantly  reduce  network  traffic.  Generally,  device
vendors  should  choose  a  value  that  corresponds  to  expected  device  usage:  short  durations
for  devices  that  are  expected  to  be  part  of  the  network  for  short  periods  of  time,  and
significantly  longer  durations  for  devices  expected  to  be  long-term  members  of  the  network.
Devices  that  frequently  connect  to  and  leave  the  network  (such  as  mobile  wireless  devices)
should  use  a  shorter  duration  so  that  control  points  have  a  more  accurate  view  of  their
availability.  Advertisements  in  a  set  (both  initial  and  subsequent)  should  have  comparable
durations. Advertisements in the initial set should  be sent as quickly as possible. Subsequent
refreshments of the advertisements are allowed to be spread over time rather than being sent
as a group.

Spreading  refreshments  of  advertisements  over  time  rather  than  being  sent  as  a  group
improves  reliability  in  case  there  are  network  glitches:  without  increasing  the  total  network
load it increases the frequency of sending announcements from devices to control points. The
two figures below show the announcement behavior without spreading and with spreading the

messages over the entire interval. The figures show a timeline from the moment a device joins
the network, sends its initial announcements (represented by vertical lines), and subsequently
periodically sends repeat announcements. In the second figure, these repeat announcements
are spread over the entire period rather than sent as a bunch.

Figure 1-4: — Initial and repeat announcements, message spreading of repeat
announcements

Devices  should  wait  a  random  interval  (e.g.  between  0  and  100milliseconds)  before  sending
an  initial  set  of  advertisements  in  order  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  network  storms;  this
random  interval  should  also  be  applied  on  occasions  where  the  device  obtains  a  new  IP
address or a new UPnP-enabled interface is installed.

Due  to  the  unreliable  nature  of  UDP,  devices  should  send  the  entire  set  of  discovery
messages more than once with some delay between sets e.g. a few hundred milliseconds. To
avoid  network  congestion  discovery  messages  should  not  be  sent  more  than  three  times.  In
addition,  the  device  shall  re-send  its  advertisements  periodically  prior  to  expiration  of  the
duration  specified  in  the  CACHE-CONTROL  header  field;  it  is  Recommended  that  such
refreshing  of  advertisements  be  done  at  a  randomly-distributed  interval  of  less  than  one-half
of  the  advertisement  expiration  time,  so  as  to  provide  the  opportunity  for  recovery  from  lost
advertisements  before
the
advertisement  refreshment  of  multiple  devices  on  the  network  in  order  to  avoid  spikes  in
network  traffic.  Note  that  UDP  packets  are  also  bounded  in  length  (perhaps  as  small  as  512
Bytes  in  some  implementations);  each  discovery  message  shall  fit  entirely  in  a  single  UDP
packet.  There  is  no  guarantee  that  the  above  3+2d+k  messages  will  arrive  in  a  particular
order.

to  distribute  over

time

A  multi-homed  device  shall  perform  the  above  announcement  procedures  on  each  of  its
UPnP-enabled  interfaces.  Advertisements  sent  on  multiple  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  shall
contain  the  same  field  values  except  for  the  HOST,  CACHE-CONTROL  and  LOCATION
header  fields.  The  HOST  field  value  of  an  advertisement  shall  be  the  standard  multicast
address specified for the protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) used on the interface. The URL specified by
the LOCATION header field shall be reachable on the interface on which the advertisement is
sent.  Finally,  advertisements  sent  on  different  interfaces  are  allowed  to  have  different
CACHE-CONTROL field values and are allowed to be sent with different frequencies.

When  a  device  is  added  to  the  network,  it  shall  send  a  multicast  message  with  method
NOTIFY  and  ssdp:alive  in  the NTS  header  field  in  the  following  format.  Values  in italics  are
placeholders for actual values.

NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1
HOST: 239.255.255.250:1900
CACHE-CONTROL: max-age = seconds until advertisement expires
LOCATION: URL for UPnP description for root device
NT: notification type
NTS: ssdp:alive
SERVER: OS/version UPnP/2.0 product/version
USN: composite identifier for the advertisement
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG: number increased each time device sends an initial announce or an update
message
CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG: number used for caching description information
SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG: number identifies port on which device responds to unicast M-SEARCH

Note:  No  body  is  sent  for  messages  with  method  NOTIFY,  but  note  that  the  message  shall
have a blank line following the last header field.

The TTL for the IP packet should default to 2 and should be configurable.

Listed  below  are  details  for  the  request  line  and  header  fields  appearing  in  the  listing  above.
Field names are not case sensitive. All field values are case sensitive except where noted.

service)  is  no  longer  available;  as  long  as  a  control  point  has  received  at  least  one  advertisement  that  is  still
valid from a root device, any of its embedded devices or any of its services, then the control point can assume
that  all  are  available.  The  number  of  seconds should  be  greater  than  or  equal  to  1800  seconds  (30  minutes),
although  exceptions  are  defined  in  the  text  above.  Specified  by  UPnP  vendor.  Other  directives  shall  NOT  be

BOOTID.UPNP.ORG

Required.  The  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  header  field  represents  the  boot  instance  of  the  device  expressed
according  to  a  monotonically  increasing  value.  Its  field  value  shall  be  a  non-negative  31-bit  integer;  ASCII
encoded, decimal, without leading zeros (leading zeroes, if present, shall be ignored by the recipient) that shall
be  increased  on  each  initial  announce  of  the  UPnP  device  or  shall  be  the  same  as  the  field  value  of  the
NEXTBOOTID.UPNP.ORG header field in the last sent SSDP update message. Its field value shall  remain the
same on all periodically repeated announcements. A convenient mechanism is to set this field value to the time
that the device sends its initial announcement, expressed as seconds elapsed since midnight January 1, 1970;
for  devices  that  have  a  notion  of  time,  this  will  not  require  any  additional  state  to  remember  or  be  “flashed”.
However,  it  is  perfectly  acceptable  to  use  a  simple  boot  counter  that  is  incremented  on  every  initial

announcement as a field value of this header field. As such, control points shall  NOT view this header field as
a timestamp. The BOOTID.UPNP.ORG header field shall  be included in all  announcements of a root device, its
embedded devices and its services. Unless the device explicitly updates its value by sending an SSDP update
message,  as  long  as  the  device  remains  available  in  the  network,  the  same  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value
shall be used in all announcements, search responses, update messages and eventually bye-bye messages.

Control  points  can  use  this  header  field  to  detect  the  case  when  a  device  leaves  and  rejoins  the  network
(“reboots”  in  UPnP  terms).  It  can  be  used  by  control  points  for  a  number  of  purposes  such  as  re-establishing
desired  event  subscriptions,  checking  for  changes  to  the  device  state  that  were  not  evented  since  the  device
was off-line.

CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG

Required.  The  CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG  field  value  shall  be  a  non-negative,  31-bit  integer,  ASCII  encoded,
decimal,  without  leading  zeros  (leading  zeroes,  if  present,  shall  be  ignored  by  the  recipient)  that  shall
represent the configuration number of a root device. UPnP 2.0 devices are allowed to be freely assign configid
numbers  from  0  to  16777215  (2^24-1).  Higher  numbers  are  reserved  for  future  use,  and  can  be  assigned  by
the Technical Committee. The configuration  of a root device consists of the following information: the DDD of
the  root  device  and  all  its  embedded  devices,  and  the  SCPDs  of  all  the  contained  services.  If  any  part  of  the
configuration  changes,  the  CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG  field  value  shall  be  changed.  The  CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG
header  field  shall  be  included  in  all  announcements  of  a  root  device,  its  embedded  devices  and  its  services.
The configuration number that is present in a CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG field value shall satisfy the following rule:

•

if a device sends out two messages with a CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG header field with the same field value K,
the configuration shall be the same at the moments that these messages were sent.

Whenever a control point receives a CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG header field with a field value K, and subsequently
downloads  the  configuration  information,  this  configuration  information  is  associated  with  K.  As  an  additional
safeguard, the device shall  include a configId  attribute with value K in the returned description (see clause  2,
“Description”).  The  following  caching  rules  for  control  poi nts  supersede  the  caching  rules  that  are  defined  in
UPnP 1.0:

•  Control points are allowed to  ignore the CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG header field and use the caching rules that
are based on  advertisement expirations as defined in Clause 2, Description: as long as at least one of the
discovery  advertisements  from  a  root  device,  its  embedded  devices  and  its  services  have  not  expired,  a
control  point  is  allowed  to  assume  that  the  root  device  and  all  its  embedded  devices  and  all  its  services
are  available.  The  device  and  service  descriptions  are  allowed  to  be  retrieved  at  any  point  since  the
device and service descriptions are static as long as the device and its services are available.

•

•

If no configuration number is included in a received SSDP message, control points should  cache based on
advertisement expirations as defined in Clause  2 Description.

If a CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG header field with field value K is included in a received SSDP message, and a
control  point  has  already  cached  information  associated  with  field  value  K,  the  control  point is  allowed  to
use  this  cached  information  as  the  current  configuration  of  the  device.  Otherwise,  a  control  point  should
assume it has not cached the current configuration of the device and needs to send new description query
messages.

The  CONFIGID.UPNP.ORG  header  field  reduces  peak  loads  on  UPnP  devices  during  startup  and  during
network hiccups. Only if a control point receives an announcement of an unknown configuration is downloading
required.

SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG

Allowed.  If  a  device  does  not  send  the  SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG  header  field,  it shall  respond  to  unicast  M-
SEARCH  messages  on  port  1900.  Only  if  port  1900  is  unavailable   it  is  allowed  for a  device  select  a  different
port  to  respond  to  unicast  M-SEARCH  messages.  If  a  device  sends  the  SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG  header
field,  its  field  value  shall  be  an  ASCII  encoded  integer,  decimal,  without  leading  zeros  (leading  zeroes,  if
present, shall be ignored by the recipient), in the range 49152-65535 (RFC 4340). The device shall  respond to
unicast M-SEARCH messages that are sent to the advertised port.

SECURELOCATION.UPNP.ORG

Allowed. Required when Device Protection is implemented.

The SECURELOCATION.UPNP.ORG header shall  provide a base URL with “https:” for the scheme component
and  indicate  the  correct  “port”  subcomponent  in  the  “authority”  component  for  a  TLS  connection.  Because  the
scheme  and  authority  components  are  not  included  in  relative  URLs,  these  components  are  obtained  from  the
base  URL  provided  by  either  LOCATION  or  SECURELOCATION.UPNP.ORG.  See  for  more  information  Ref
DEVICEPROTECTION.

1.2.3

Device unavailable --  NOTIFY with ssdp:byebye

When a device and its services are going to be removed from the network, the device should
multicast  an  ssdp:byebye  message  corresponding  to  each  of  the  ssdp:alive  messages  it
multicasted that have not already expired. If the device is removed abruptly from the network,
it  might  not  be  possible  to  multicast  a  message.  As  a  fallback,  discovery  messages  shall
include an expiration value in a CACHE-CONTROL field value (as explained above); if not re-
advertised, the discovery message eventually expires on its own.

(Note:  when  a  control  point  is  about  to  be  removed  from  the  network,  no  discovery-related
action is required.)

When  a  device  is  about  to  be  removed  from  the  network,  it  should  explicitly  revoke  its
discovery messages by sending one multicast message for each  ssdp:alive  message it sent.
Each  multicast  message  shall  have  method  NOTIFY  and  ssdp:byebye  in  the  NTS  header
field in the following format. Values in italics are placeholders for actual values.

When  a  multi-homed  device  is  about  to  be  removed  from  the  network  on  one  or  more  of  its
UPnP-enabled  interfaces,  it  should  explicitly  revoke  its  discovery  messages  by  sending  one
multicast  message  for  each  ssdp:alive  message  it  has  previously  sent  on  those  interfaces
and  IP  addresses.  It  shall  NOT  send  such  multicast  messages  to  any  of  the  UPnP-enabled
interfaces that remain available.

When  ssdp:byebye  messages  are  sent  on  multiple  UPnP-enabled  interfaces,  the  messages
shall  contain  identical  field  values  except  for  the  HOST  field  value.  The  HOST  field  value  of
an  advertisement  shall  be  the  standard  multicast  address  specified  for  the  protocol  (IPv4  or
IPv6) used on the interface.

If  a  control  point  has  received  at  least  one  ssdp:byebye  message  of  a  root  device,  any  of  its
embedded  devices  or  any  of  its  services  then  the  control  point  can  assume  that  all  are  no
longer available. As a fallback, if a control point fails to receive notification that a root device,
its  embedded  devices  and  its  services  are  unavailable,  the  original  discovery  messages  will
eventually  expire  yielding  the  same  effect.  Only  when  all  original  advertisements  of  a  root
device,  its  embedded  devices  and  its  services  have  expired  can  a  control  point  assume  that
they are no longer available.

If a multi-homed control point has received at least one ssdp:byebye message of a root device,
any of its embedded devices or any of its services on one of its UPnP-enabled  interfaces then
the control point can assume that all are no longer available on that UPnP-enabled interface.
However, the control point shall NOT assume that the device is also no longer available on all
of  its  other  UPnP-enabled  interfaces.  As  a  fallback,  if  a  control  point  fails  to  receive
notification  that  a  root  device,  its  embedded  devices  and  its  services  are  unavailable  on  a
particular  UPnP-enabled  interface,  the  original  discovery  messages  will  eventually  expire
yielding the same effect. Only when all original advertisements of a root device, its embedded
devices  and  its  services  received  on  a  UPnP-enabled  interface  have  expired  can  a  control
point assume that they are no longer available on that interface or IP address.

1.2.4

Device Update – NOTIFY with ssdp:update

itself  on  all

When  a  new  UPnP-enabled  interface  is  added  to  a  multi-homed  device,  the  device  shall
increase  its  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value,  multicast  an  ssdp:update  message  for  each  of
the  root  devices,  embedded  devices  and  embedded  services  to  all  of  the  existing  UPnP-
enabled  interfaces  to  announce  a  change  in  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value,  and  re-
advertise
the  new
(existing  and  new)  UPnP-enabled
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value.  Similarly,  if  a  multi-homed  device  loses  connectivity  on  a
UPnP-enabled  interface  and  regains  connectivity,  or  if  the  IP  address  on  one  of  the  UPnP-
enabled  interfaces  changes,  the  device  shall  increase  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value,
multicast  an  ssdp:update  message  for  each  of  the  root  devices,  embedded  devices  and
embedded  services  to  all  the  unaffected  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  to  announce  a  change  in
the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value,  and  re-advertise  itself  on  all  (affected  and  unaffected)
UPnP-enabled  interfaces  with  the  new  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value.  In  all  cases,  the

ssdp:update  messages  should  be  spread  over  time.  However,  all  ssdp:update  messages

1.3

Search

When a control point is added to the network, the UPnP discovery protocol allows that control
point  to  search  for  devices  of  interest  on  the  network.  It  does  this  by  multicasting  on  the
reserved address and port (239.255.255.250:1900) a search messag e with a pattern, or target,
equal to a type or identifier for a device or service. Responses from devices contain discovery
messages  essentially  identical  to  those  advertised  by  newly  connected  devices;  the  former
are  unicast  while  the  latter  are  multicas t.  Control  points  can  also  send  a  unicast  search
indicated  by
IP  address  and  port  1900  or
message
SEARCHPORT.UPNP.ORG,  to    verify  the  existence  of  UPnP  device(s)  and  service(s)  at  the
IP  address.  For  example,  a  unicast  search  may  be  used  to  quickly  check  whether  a  known
UPnP  device  or  service  is  still  available  on  the  network.  Multi-homed  control  points  are
allowed  to  choose  to  send  discovery  messages  on  any,  some  or  all  of  its  UPnP-enabled
interfaces.

1.3.1

Search protocols and standards

To search for devices (and be discovered by control points), control points (and devices) use
the  following  subset  of  the  overall  UPnP  protocol  stack.  (The  overall  UPnP  protocol  stack  is
listed at the beginning of this document.)

Figure 1-5: — Search protocol stack

UPnP vendor [purple-italic]

UPnP Forum [red-italic]

UPnP Device Architecture [green- bold]

SSDP [blue]

UDP [black]

IP [black]

At  the  highest  layer,  search  messages  contain  vendor-specific  information,  e.g.,  the  control
point, device, and service identifiers. Moving down the stack, vendor content is supplemented
by  information  from  a  UPnP  Forum  working  committee,  e.g.,  device  or  service  types.
Messages  from  the  layers  above  are  hosted  in  UPnP-specific  protocols,  defined  in  this
document.  In  turn,  search  requests  are  delivered  via  multicast  and  unicast  SSDP  messages
defined  in  this  document.  Search  responses  are  delivered  via  a  unicast  SSDP  messages
defined  in  this  document.  Both  kinds  of  messages  are  delivered  via  UDP  over  IP.  For
reference,  colors  in  [square  brackets]  above  indicate  which  protocol  defines  specific  header
fields and field values in discovery messages listed below.

1.3.2

Search request with M-SEARCH

When  a  control  point  desires  to  search  the  network  for  devices,  it  shall  send  a  multicast
request with method M-SEARCH in the following format. Control points that know the address
of  a  specific  device  are  allowed  to  also  use  a  similar  format  to  send  unicast  requests  with
method M-SEARCH.

For  multicast  M-SEARCH,  the  message  format  is  defined  below.  Values  in  italics  are
placeholders for actual values.

M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1
HOST: 239.255.255.250:1900

Note:  No  body  is  present  in  requests  with  method  M-SEARCH,  but  note  that  the  message
shall have a blank line following the last header field.

Note: The TTL for the IP packet should default to 2 and should be configurable.

form  product name/product version.  For  example,

Due  to  the  unreliable  nature  of  UDP,  control  points  should  send  each  M-SEARCH  message
more than once. As a fallback, to guard against the possibility that a device might not receive
the  M-SEARCH  message  from  a  control  point,  a  device  should  re-send  its  advertisements
periodically (see CACHE-CONTROL header field in NOTIFY with ssdp:alive above).

For  a  multicast  request,  the  control  point  should  wait  at  least  the  amount  of  time  specified  in
the  MX  header  field  for  responses  to  arrive  from  devices.  The  random  distribution  of
responses over the MX interval means that a responder  is allowed to  send a response at MX
seconds after receiving the M-SEARCH request. The MX field value is allowed to be adjusted
by  heuristics  at  the  requester  based  on,  for  example,  observed  number  of  responders.
Network characteristics affecting the propagation of traffic cannot be addressed by increasing
the  MX  field  value  because  of  the  reason  cited  above.  A  requester  is  allowed  to  adapt  to
network  characteristics  with  heuristics  based  on  observed  network  behavior  (the  exact
heuristics  are  out  of  scope).  The  net  effect  is  that  the  M-SEARCH  request  persists  at  the
requester  for  a  period  of  time  exceeding  MX  such  that  the  characteristics  of  the  network  are
properly accommodated to minimize lost responses.

When  a  device  receives  a  unicast  M-SEARCH,  it  should  respond  within  1  second  and  it  is
allowed  to  respond  sooner.  The  sender  of  the  unicast  request should  wait  at  least  1  second
for the response.

Updated  versions  of  device  and  service  types  are  required  to  be  fully  backward  compatible
with  previous  versions.  Devices  shall  respond  to  M-SEARCH  requests  for  any  supported
version.  For  example,  if  a  device  implements  “urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:xyz:2”,  it  shall
respond to search requests for both that type and “urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:xyz:1”. The
response  shall  specify  the  same  version  as  was  contained  in  the  search  request.  If  a  control

point  searches  for  a  device  or  service  of  a  particular  version  and  receives  no  responses
(presumably because no device present on the network supports the specified version), but is
willing  to  operate  using  a  lower  version,  it is  allowed  to  repeat  the  search  request  specifying
the lower version.

1.3.3

Search response

To be found  by a  network search,  a  device shall  send a  unicast  UDP response to  the source
IP address and port that sent the request to the multicast address. Devices respond if the ST
header  field  of  the  M-SEARCH  request  is  “ssdp:all”,  “upnp:rootdevice”,  “uuid:”  followed  by  a
UUID  that  exactly  matches  the  one  advertised  by  the  device,  or  if  the  M-SEARCH  request
matches  a  device  type  or  service  type  supported  by  the  device.  Multi-homed  devices  shall
send  the  search  response  using  the  same  UPnP-enabled  interface  on  which  the  search
request  was  received.  The  URL  specified  in  the  LOCATION  field  value  shall  specify  an
address that is reachable on that interface.

Devices responding to a multicast M-SEARCH should wait a random period of time between 0
seconds  and  the  number  of  seconds  specified  in  the  MX  field  value  of  the  search  request
before  responding,  in  order  to  avoid  flooding  the  requesting  control  point  with  search
responses  from  multiple  devices.  If  the  search  request  results  in  the  need  for  a  multiple  part
response from the device, those multiple part responses should be spread at random intervals
through  the  time  period  from  0  to  the  number  of  seconds  specified  in  the  MX  header  field.
Devices  are  allowed  to  assume  an  MX  field  value  less  than  that  specified  in  the  MX  header
field.  If  the  MX  header  field  specifies  a  field  value  greater  than  5,  the  device should  assume
that it contained the value 5 or less. Devices shall not stop responding to other requests while
waiting the random delay before sending a response.

For multicast M-SEARCH requests, if the search request does not contain an MX header field,
the device shall silently discard and ignore the search request. If the MX header field specifies
a field value greater than 5, the device should assume that it contained the value 5 or less.

since the transport over TCP is reliable, hence ignoring the MX value. The reply to the control
point  can  be  formatted  as  1  message  replying  to  all  applicable  USN  as  required  by  the  M-
SEARCH  syntax.  The  list  of  USNs  can  be  conveyed  by  a  comma  separated  list,  see  RFC

valid from a root device, any of its embedded devices or any of its services, then the control point can assume
that  all  are  available.  The  number  of  seconds should  be  greater than  or  equal  to  1800  seconds  (30  minutes),

2  Description

Description is Step 2 in UPnP networking. Description comes after addressing (Step 0) where
devices  get  a  network  address,  and  after  discovery  (Step  1)  where  control  points  find
interesting  device(s).  Description  enables  control  (Step  3)  where  control  points  send
commands  to  device(s),  eventing  (Step  4)  where  control  points  listen  to  state  changes  in
device(s),  and  presentation  (Step  5)  where  control  points  may  display  an  html  user  interface
for device(s).

After a control point has discovered a device, the control point still knows very little about the
device  --  only  the  information  that  was  in  the  discovery  message,  i.e.,  the  device's  (or
service's)  UPnP  type,  the  device's  universally-unique  identifier,  and  a  URL  to  the  device's
UPnP description. For the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities, or
to  interact  with  the  device,  the  control  point shall  retrieve  a  description  of  the  device  and  its
capabilities from the URL provided by the device in the discovery message.

The  UPnP  description  for  a  device  is  partitioned  into  two  logical  parts:  a  device  description
describing  the  physical  and  logical  containers,  and  service  descriptions  describing  the
capabilities  exposed  by  the  device.  A  UPnP  device  description  includes  vendor-specific
manufacturer  information  like  the  model  name  and  number,  serial  number,  manufacturer
name,  URLs  to  vendor-specific  Web  sites,  etc.  (details  below).  For  each  service  included  in
the  device,  the  device  description  lists  the  service  type,  service  name,  a  URL  for  a  service
description,  a  URL  for  control,  and  a  URL  for  eventing.  A  device  description  also  includes  a
description of all embedded devices and a URL for presentation of the aggregate. This clause
explains  UPnP  device  descriptions,  and  the  clauses  on  Control,  Eventing,  and  Presentation
explain how URLs for control, eventing, and presentation are used respectively.

Note  that  a  single  physical  device  is  allowed  to  include  multiple  logical  devices.  Multiple
logical devices can be modeled as a single root device with embedded devices (and services)
or  as  multiple root  devices (perhaps with  no  embedded  devices).  In  the former case, there  is
one  UPnP  device  description  for  the  root  device,  and  that  device  description  contains  a
description  for  all  embedded  devices.  In  the  latter  case,  there  are  multiple  UPnP  device
descriptions, one for each root device.

A UPnP device description is written by a UPnP vendor. The description is in XML syntax and
is usually based on a standard UPnP Device Template. A UPnP Device Template is produced
by  a  UPnP  Forum  working  committee;  they  derive  the  template  from  the  UPnP  Device
Schema,  which  was  derived  from  standard  constructions  in  XML.  This  clause  explains  the
format  for  a  UPnP  device  description,  UPnP  Device  Templates,  and  the  part  of  the  UPnP
Device Schema that covers devices.

A  UPnP  service  description  includes  a  list  of  commands,  or  actions,  to  which  the  service
responds, and parameters, or arguments for each action. A service description also includes a
list of variables. These variables model the state of the service at run time, and are described
in  terms  of  their  data  type,  range,  and  event  characteristics.  This  clause  explains  the
description  of  actions,  arguments,  state  variables,  and  the  properties  of  those  variables.  The
clause on Eventing explains event characteristics.

Like a UPnP device description, a UPnP service description is written by a UPnP vendor. The
description  is  in  XML  syntax  and  is  usually  based  on  a  standard  UPnP  Service  Template.  A
UPnP  Service  Template  is  produced  by  a  UPnP  Forum  working  committee;  they  derived  the
template  from  the  UPnP  Service  Schema,  augmenting  it  with  human  language  where
necessary. The UPnP Service Schema is derived using the conventions of XML Schema. This
clause  explains  the  format  for  a  UPnP  service  description,  UPnP  Service  Templates,  typical
augmentations  in  human  language,  and  the  part  of  the  UPnP  Service  Schema  that  covers
services.

UPnP  vendors  can  differentiate  their  devices  by  extending  services  (see  clause  2.7,  “Non-
standard  vendor  extensions  and
including  additional  UPnP  services,  or
embedding additional devices. When a control point retrieves a particular device's description,
these  added  features  are  exposed  to  the  control  point  for  control  and  eventing.  The  device
and service descriptions authoritatively document the implementation of the device.

limitations”),

Retrieving  a  UPnP  device  description  is  simple:  the  control  point  issues  an  HTTP  GET
request on  the  URL  in  the  discovery  message,  and the  device returns  the  device  description.
Retrieving  a  UPnP  service  description  is  a  similar  process  that  uses  a  URL  within  the  device
description. The protocol stack, method, header fields, and body for the response and request
are explained in detail below. Description documents shall be sent using the same IP address
on which the HTTP GET request was received.

As  long  as  at  least  one  of  the  discovery  advertisements  from  a  root  device,  any  of  its
embedded  devices  or  any  of  its  services  have  not  expired  and  none  of  the  advertisements
have  been  cancelled,  a  control  point  is  allowed  to  assume  that  the  root  device  and  all  its
embedded devices and all  its services  are  available. The device and service descriptions  are
allowed  to  be  retrieved  at  any  point  since  the  device  and  service  descriptions  are  static  as
long  as  the  device  and  its  services  are  available.  If  a  device  cancels  at  least  one  of  its
advertisements  or  if  all  the  advertisements  expire,  a  control  point  should  assume  the  device
and its services are no longer available. If a device needs to change one of these descriptions,
it  shall  cancel  its  outstanding  advertisements  and  re-advertise.  Consequently,  control  points
should not assume that device and service descriptions are unchanged if a device re-appears

if  a  changed

the  network,  but

Like  discovery,  description  plays  an  important  role  in  the  interoperability  of  devices  and
control  points  using  different  versions  of  UPnP  networking.  As  explained  in  clause  1,
“Discovery”, the UPnP Device Architecture is versioned with  both a major and a  minor version.
The  major  version  and  minor  version  are  separate  integer  numbers;  they  are  not  to  be
interpreted  or compared  as though they were a single  decimal number, even  though  they  are
allowed to appear as such in print. Advances in minor versions shall be a compatible superset
of  earlier  minor  versions  of  the  same  major  version;  therefore  device  vendors  are  free  to
implement  standardized  devices  and  services  on  versions  of  the  architecture  with  a  higher
minor  version  number.  Advances  in  major  version  are  not  required  to  be  supersets  of  earlier
versions  and  are  not  guaranteed  to  be  backward  compatible.  However  UDA  version  2.0  is
specified as a superset of UDA 1.1 and is thus backwards compatible with UDA 1.x versions.
Therefore  UDA  2.0  control  points  shall  maintain  interoperability  with  UDA  1.x  devices.  UDA
1.x control points can work with UDA 2.0 devices, but can’t access the additional functionality
specified in UDA 2.0. The architecture version of a root device, all its embedded devices and
all  its  services  shall  be  the  same.  Version  information  is  communicated  in  description
messages  as  a  backup  to  the  information  communicated  in  discovery  messages.  This  clause
explains the format of version information in description messages.

Device  and  service  types  standardized  by  UPnP  Forum  working  committees  or  created  by
vendors  have  an  integer  version.  Every  later  version  of  a  device  or  service  shall  be  a  fully
backwardly  compatible  superset  of  the  previous  version,  i.e.,  compared  to  earlier  versions  of
the device, it shall include all mandatory embedded devices and services of the same or later
version.  The  UPnP  device  or  service  type  remains  the  same  across  all  versions  of  a  device
whereas  the  device  or  service  version  shall  be  larger  for  later  versions.  Versions  of  device
and  service  templates  are  allowed  to  have  non-integer  versions  (such  as  “0.9”)  during
development in the working committee, but this shall become an integer upon standardization.
Devices  and  services  are  allowed  to  have  a  version  number  greater  than  the  major  version
number of the architecture they are designed for (e.g., “Power:2” is allowed to be designed to
work  on  UDA  version  1.0);  there  is  no  direct  correlation  between  the  version  of  a  device  or
service  template  and  the  architecture  version  with  which  it  is  designed  to  work.  If  a  non-
backward-compatible version of a device or service is defined, it shall have a different device
or  service  name  to  indicate  that  it  is  not  backwardly  compatible  (and  version  numbers  of  the
new type shall restart at 1).

UPnP  device  and  service  types  are  “building  blocks”  that  is  allowed  to  be  assembled  in
various  combinations.  Both  standard  and  vendor-defined  device  types  are  allowed  to  be
embedded  in  standard  device  types.  Both  standard  and  vendor-defined  device  types  are
allowed to be embedded in vendor-defined device types. Likewise, both standard and vendor-
defined  service  types  are  allowed  be  embedded  in  both  standard  and  vendor-defined  device
types. A control point that is capable of operating with a particular device or service type shall
at least recognize that device or service type even when it is embedded within another device
type  (standard  or  vendor-defined)  that  it  does  not  recognize.  For  example,  if  a  standard
service  type  “Print:1”  is  defined,  and  a  standard  device  type  “Printer:1”  is  defined  that
contains the “Print:1” service, a control point that wishes to use the “Print:1” service shall find
and use it whether the service is embedded within a “urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:Printer:1”
device  or  embedded  within  a  vendor-defined  “urn:acme-com:device:Printer:1”    or  “urn:acme-
com:device:AcmeMultifunctionPrinter:1” device.

information,  embedded  devices,  and  URLs

The  remainder  of  this  clause  first  explains  how  devices  are  described,  explaining  details  of
vendor-specific
for  control,  eventing,  and
presentation. Second, it explains UPnP Device Templates. Third, it explains how services are
described,  explaining  details  of  actions,  arguments,  state  variables,  and  properties  of  those
variables. Then  it  explains  UPnP Service  Templates,  and the  UPnP  Service  Schema. Finally,
this  clause  explains  in  detail  how  a  control  point  retrieves  device  and  service  descriptions
from a device.

2.1  Generic requirements on HTTP usage

This  subclause  defines  generic  requirements  on  HTTP  usage  in  UPnP  Version  2 .0.  HTTP  is
the underlying transport for:

•  Description (see clause 2, “Description”)

•  Control (see clause 3, “Control”)

•  Eventing (see clause 4, “Eventing”)

•  Presentation (clause 5, “Presentation”)

The  baseline  transport  for  all  devices  and  control  points  is  recommended  to  be  HTTP/1.1
compliant  (as  defined  in  RFC  2616)  but  at  least  shall  be  HTTP/1.0  compliant  (as  defined  in
RFC  1945).  Vendors  are  free  to  implement  and  Working  Committees  are  free  to  require  for
new  device  classes  implementations  of  more  recent  versions  of  HTTP  that  are  backwards
compatible  with  HTTP  version  1.0,  such  as  HTTP  version  1.1  as  defined  in  RFC  2616.
However  whatever  version  is  implemented,  all required  components  defined  by  the  specified
HTTP version shall be implemented.

If a control point uses an HTTP/1.0 binding on a SOAP request without setting the KeepAlive
token, the device shall close the socket after responding. If a control point uses an HTTP/1.1
binding  on  a  SOAP  request,  and  sets  the  “Connection:CLOSE”  token,  the  device shall  close
the socket after responding.

USER-AGENT header field

Control  points  can  add  the  USER-AGENT  header field  to  any UPnP-related  HTTP  request  to
signal  that  they  support  UPnP  1.1.  Working  Committees  are  allowed  to  require  presence  of
this  header  on  description  retrieval,  action  invocations  and  event  subscriptions  for  newly
defined services.

USER-AGENT: OS/version UPnP/2.0 product/version

USER-AGENT

Allowed.Specified  by UPnP vendor. String. Field value shall  begin  with the following “product tokens”  (defined
by  HTTP/1.1).  The  first  product  token  identifes  the  operating  system  in  the  form  OS  name/OS version,  the

second  token  represents  the  UPnP  version  and  shall  be  UPnP/2.0,  and  the  third  token  identifes  the  product

form  product name/product version.  For  example,

the

Accept-Encoding header field

Control  points  can add  the  Accept-Encoding  header  field  to  any  UPnP-related  HTTP  request
to signal that they support the type of encoding.

Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip

Accept-Encoding

Allowed.Specified  by  RFC2616  section  14.3.  Allowed  encoding  are  identitiy,  compress  and  gzip.  The  identity
encoding  shall  be  present  and  without  value  q=0.  When  the  request  is  satisfied  by  the  Server,  then  the
content-encoding  header  shall  be  present.  The  value  of  the  content_encoding  header  specifies  the  used
encoding type of the response. Used values are vendor specific.

UPnP friendly Name header field

Control  points  shall  add  the  CPFN.UPNP.ORG  header  field  to  any  UPnP-related  HTTP
request to signal the friendly name of the control point.

CPFN.UPNP.ORG: friendly name

CPFN.UPNP.ORG

Required.Specifies  the  friendly  name  of  the  control  point.  The  friendly  name  is  vendor  specific.  When  Device
Protection is implemented the CPFN.UPNP.ORG shall be the same as the <Name> of Device Protection unless
the Device Protection <Alias> is defined, in which case it shall use the  <Alias>.

UPnP identifier header field

Control  points  can  add  the  CPUUID.UPNP.ORG  header  field  to  any  UPnP-related  HTTP
request to signal the unique identifier of the control point.

CPUUID.UPNP.ORG: uuid of control point

CPUUID.UPNP.ORG

Allowed.uuid of the control point.  When the control point is implemented in  a UPnP device  it is recommended
to  use  the  UDN  of  the  co-located  UPnP  device.  When  implemented,  all  specified  requirements  for  uuid  usage
in  devices  also  apply  for  control  points.See  section    1.1.4.  Note  that  when  Device  Protection  is  implemented
the CPUUID.UPNP.ORG shall be the same as the uuid used in Device Protection.

.

Vendor-defined or working committee-defined HTTP Header fields

HTTP field names defined by vendors or working committees shall have the following format:

field-name = token “.” domain-name

where  the  domain-name  shall  be  a  Vendor  Domain  Name  or  shall  be  “UPNP.ORG”  (for
working  committee  defined  field  names),  and  in  addition  shall  satisfy  the  token  format  as
defined in RFC 2616 clause 2.2. Field names are case-insensitive.

HTTP/1.0 Persistent connections

Some  implementations  of  HTTP/1.0  defined  what  is  known  as  persistent  connections.  There
are many practical uses for this functionality, as it may reduce overhead for a given device by
allowing resources to be used more efficiently. However, this functionality for HTTP/1.0 is not
officially  defined  in  the  specification  and  classified  as  experimental.  Further,  the  way  it  has
been  experimentally  defined  is  flawed  in  such  a  way  that  it  may  cause  sessions  to  hang  in
certain scenarios. This functionality shall not be implemented by any UPnP devices or control
points that implement HTTP version 1.0.

— 47 —

HTTP/1.0 HEAD request

Some implementations utilize the HEAD request to try to predetermine the amount of memory
required  to  process  a  GET  request.  Some  servers  may  not  know  that  size  of  the  content
because  it  may  be  dynamic.  In  such  cases,  the  responses  will  not  contain  a  CONTENT-
LENGTH  header  field.  As  such,  control  points  shall  not  rely  on  the  CONTENT-LENGTH
header field being specified for a HEAD response.

HTTP/1.1 General

When  a  device  or  control  point  implements  HTTP/1.1,  all  requirements  of  HTTP/1.0 shall  be
maintained,  with  the  exception  of  the  CONTENT-LENGTH  header  field,  which  shall  not  be
specified when doing chunked transfers.

HTTP status codes

Servers  shall  return  appropriate  HTTP  status  codes  for  invalid  requests.  A  device  or  control
point shall use a 4xx HTTP status code for responses that indicate a problem with the format
of  a  request  or  response.  For  example,  if  an  HTTP  client  makes  a  PUT  request  to  a  server
that  does  not  implement  the  PUT  method,  the  server  should  return  a  "405  Method  not
Allowed" HTTP status code and shall return a 4xx series HTTP status code. Another example
is  if  an  HTTP  client  makes  a  request  to  a  server  that  is  malformed  HTTP  or  not  well  formed
XML,  the server should return  a "400  Bad  Request" HTTP status code and shall return  a  4xx
series  HTTP  status code.  While  clients  are  not  required  to  understand  specific  status  codes,
they  shall  understand  classes  of  status  codes.  For  example,  a  4xx  series  HTTP  status  code
signifies an  improper request,  whereas  a  5xx series  HTTP status code signifies  a processing
error for a valid request.

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 compatibility

Devices  and  control  points  that  implement  HTTP/1.1  shall  be  able  to  interoperate  with
HTTP/1.0  control  points  and  devices.  Care  shall  be  taken  when  devices  and  control  points
process  requests,  such  that  the  response  generated  is  compatible  with  the  HTTP  version
specified  in  the  request.  For  example,  if  an  HTTP/1.0  request  is  made,  the  device  or  control
point shall not return an HTTP/1.1 chunked response.

HTTP/1.1 HOST header field and use of the HOST header field with HTTP/1.0

The  ‘HOST’  header  field  shall  be  specified  in  all  requests,  because  HTTP/1.1  allows  support
for virtual domains, which rely on this header field to determine the target destination.

The  HOST  header  field  shall  also  be  included  in  HTTP/1.0  requests,  for  backwards
compatibility  with  UPnP  1.0,  which  REQUIRES  the  HOST  header  field  to  be  present  without
explicitly mentioning a HTTP version.

HTTP/1.1 EXPECT: 100-Continue

Servers are allowed to send a “100-Continue” HTTP status code to let the client know that the
header fields received have been processed. If a client will rely on this status response before
sending  the  body,  it  shall  send  the  “EXPECT:  100-Continue”  header  field  in  the  request.  If  a
server  received  this  header  field  in  the  request,  it  shall  not  wait  for  the  request  body  before
sending the continue response. However, a client shall be prepared to handle cases when the
“EXPECT:  100-Continue”  header  field  is  not  sent,  but  a  “100-Continue”  HTTP  status  code  is
still received from the server.

HTTP/1.1 Chunked Encoding

Devices  and  control  points  that  advertise  support  for  HTTP/1.1  shall  have  support  for
decoding  chunked  encoded  messages.  Chunked  encoded  messages  are  allowed  to  contain
Chunk-Extensions, which are delineated with a ‘;’. Extensions that are not recognized shall be
ignored, which includes the absence of an extension, but the presence of the delineator.

Chunked  encoding  also  allows  responses  and  requests  to  include  trailer  fields,  which  are
header  fields  that  follow  the  body.  Devices  and  control  points shall  only  send  trailer  fields  if

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 48 —

the request contained the ‘TE’ header field (indicates trailer processing is supported), or if the
trailer fields in the response only contain allowed metadata that can be safely ignored.

Before a control point uses chunked encoding to make a request to a device, it shall check to
ensure  that  the  device  is  an  HTTP/1.1  device.  Devices  are  allowed  to  use  different  HTTP
engines  (that  support  different  versions)  for  description,  control,  eventing  and  presentation.
Therefore, to correctly identify which HTTP version is used for processing control requests, a
HEAD request is allowed to be issued to the corresponding control URL.

HTTP/1.1 Persistent Connections

Persistent  connections
is  strongly
recommended that this behavior be maintained, as it may be beneficial in many scenarios, as
it allows for resources to be utilized more efficiently. Support for Pipelined request handling is
also recommended if persistent connections are supported.

the  default  behavior  defined  by  HTTP/1.1.

is

It

If a server responds with a “CONNECTION: close” header line, it shall close the session after
responding.  Similarly  if  a  client  specifies  “CONNECTION:  close”  in  the  request,  the  server
shall also close the session after responding.

When  Requests  are  pipelined  to  a  server,  the  server shall  answer  the  requests  in  the  order
that  they  are  received.  Clients  shall  also  be  prepared  to  retry  connections  if  pipelining  fails,
for example, if the server does not support them.

HTTP/1.1 Redirect restrictions

HTTP/1.1  defines  allowed  support  for  redirecting  an  HTTP  request.  UPnP  2.0  devices  are
allowed  to  redirect  a  request,  although  this  is  not    recommended.  If  a  UPnP  2.0  device
redirects  a  request,  it  shall  respond  with  a  “307  Temporary  Redirect”  HTTP  status  code  (see
also  RFC  2616).  UPnP  2.0  devices  shall  not  return  any  other  HTTP/1.1  redirect  options.
Control  points  shall  implement  HTTP/1.1  redirect  and  should  redirect  the  request  upon
receiving a “307 Temporary Redirect” HTTP status code (see also RFC 2616).

2.2  Generic requirements on XML usage

XML namespace prefixes do not have to be the specific strings that are used in the examples
in  this  specification.  They  can  be  any  value  that  obeys  the  rules  of  the  general  XML
namespace  mechanism  as  outlined  in  the  Namespaces  in  XML  specification.  Devices  shall
accept requests that use other legal XML namespace prefixes.

If  an  XML  element  has  no  value  (i.e.  it  contains  the  empty  string) ,  it  is  valid  to  combine  the
of
XML
opening
“<actionname></actionname>”).

2.3  Device description

The  UPnP  description  for  a  device  contains  several  pieces  of  vendor-specific  information,
definitions  of  all  embedded  devices,  URL  for  presentation  of  the  device,  and  listings  for  all
services,  including  URLs  for  control  and  eventing.  In  addition  to  defining  non-standard
devices (which is allowed to contain both vendor-defined and standard embedded devices and
services),  UPnP  vendors  are  allowed  to  add  embedded  devices  and  services  to  standard
devices. To illustrate these, below is a listing with placeholders (in italics) for actual elements
and  values.  Some  of  these  placeholders  would  be  specified  by  a  UPnP  Forum  working
committee  (colored  red)  or  by  a  UPnP  vendor  (colored  purple).  For  a  non-standard  device,  all
of  these  placeholders  would  be  specified  by  a  UPnP  vendor.  Elements  defined  by  the  UPnP
Device  Architecture  are  colored  green.  Immediately  following  the  listing  is  a  detailed
explanation of the elements, attributes, and values.

devices,  repeat  once  for  each  embedded  device.  Contains  sub  elements  as  defined
above for root sub element device.

<presentationURL>

Recommended.  URL  to  presentation  for  device  (see  clause   5,  “Presentation”).  shall  be
relative  to  the  URL  at  which  the  device  description  is  located  in  accordance  with  the  rules
specified in clause 5 of RFC 3986. Specified by UPnP vendor. Single URL.

Control  points  should  recognize  and  interoperate  with  services  using  serviceId  values  other
than  the  value  defined  by  the  device  type.  If  multiple  instances  of  a  service  exist,  control
points  should  by  default  (unless  directed  otherwise  by  user  action)  use  the  service  instance
associated with the serviceId value defined by the device type. If none of the instances of the
service  have  the  serviceId  value  defined  by  the  device  type,  the  control  point  may  use  any
service instance. When only one instance of the service exists, control points should  use that
instance even if the serviceId value does not match that defined by the device type.

For future extensibility and according to the requirements in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor
extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  when  processing  XML  like  the  listing
above,  devices  and  control  points  shall  ignore:  (a)  any  unknown  elements  and  their  sub
elements or content, and (b) any unknown attributes and their values.

Subject to the constraints defined in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor extensions” and clause
2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or
XML  processing  instructions  embedded  in UPnP  device  and service descriptions  that they do
not understand. UPnP device descriptions shall be encoded using UTF-8.

When  the value of  any text  element or attribute contains  one or more characters reserved  as
markup (such as ampersand (“&”) or less than (“<”)), the text shall be escaped in accordance
with  the  provisions  of clause  2.4  of  the  XML  specification  and  each  such  character  replaced
with  the  equivalent  numeric  representation  or  string  (such  as  “&amp;”  or  “&lt;”).  Such
characters appearing in URLs are allowed to also be percent-encoded in accordance with the
URL percent-encoding rules specified in clauses 2.1 and 2.4 of RFC 3986.

XML does not support directly embedding binary data, e.g., icons in UPnP device descriptions.
Binary  data  are  allowed to  be converted into  text  (and  thereby embedded  into  XML) using an
XML  data  type  of  either  bin.base64  (a  MIME-style  base  64  encoding  for  binary  data)  or
bin.hex (hexadecimal digits represent octets). Alternatively, the data can be passed indirectly,
as  it  were,  by  embedding  a  URL  in  the  XML  and  transferring  the  data  in  response  to  a
separate  HTTP  request;  the  icon(s)  in  UPnP  device  descriptions  are  transferred  in  this  latter
manner.

If  any  icons  are  included,  at  least  one  should  be  in  the  Portable  Network  Graphics  (PNG)
format  defined  in  RFC  2083,  indicated  by  the  MIME  type  “image/png”,  and  not  use
progressive  encoding.  No  specific  icon  sizes  are  recommended  due  to  the  wide  variety
preferred  by  various  control  points;  control  point  vendors  are  encouraged  to  publish
implementation guidelines.

The  use of URLBase element  is  deprecated  by this specification. UPnP  2.0 devices shall  not
include  URLBase  in  their  description  documents.  To  ensure  interoperability  with  UPnP  1.0
devices,  control  points  shall  be  able  to  process  URLBase  if  it  is  specified  and  use  it  for
resolving relative URLs that appear elsewhere in the description. If relative URLs are included
in  the  device  description, control  points shall resolve  them  into  absolute  URLs  in  accordance
with clause 5 of RFC 3986, using either URLBase (if specified) or the location from which the
device  description  was  retrieved  as  the  base  URL,  before  using  these  URLs  for  their
respective purposes.

Note  that  in  version  1.0  of  the  UPnP  Device  Architecture,  the  serviceList  element  was
required,  and  it  was  required  to  contain  at  least  one  service  element.  These  requirements

— 54 —

were  subsequently  rescinded  to  accommodate  the  InternetGatewayDevice:1  and  Basic:1
device  types.  If the  device  has  no services, the  serviceList  element  is  allowed to be  omitted
entirely, or it is allowed to be present but contain no service elements.

2.4  UPnP Device Template

The  listing  above  also  illustrates  the  relationship  between  a  UPnP  device  description  and  a
UPnP  Device  Template.  As  explained  above,  the  UPnP  device  description  is  written  by  a
UPnP  vendor,  in  XML,  following  a  UPnP  Device  Template.  A  UPnP  Device  Template  is
produced by a UPnP Forum working committee as a means to standardize devices.

By  appropriate  specification  of  placeholders,  the  listing  above  can  be  either  a  UPnP  Device
Template or a UPnP device description. Recall that some placeholders would be defined by a
UPnP  Forum  working  committee  (colored  red),  i.e.,  the  UPnP  device  type  identifier,  required
UPnP  services,  and  required  UPnP  embedded  devices  (if  any).  If  these  were  defined,  the
listing would be a UPnP Device Template, codifying the standard for this type of device. UPnP
Device Templates are one of the key deliverables from UPnP Forum working committees.

Taking  this  another  step  further,  the  remaining  placeholders  in  the  listing  above  would  be
specified  by  a  UPnP  vendor  (colored  purple),  i.e.,  vendor-specific  information.  If  these
placeholders  were  specified  (as  well  as  the  others),  the  listing  would  be  a  UPnP  device
description,  suitable  to  be  delivered  to  a  control  point  to  enable  control,  eventing,  and
presentation.

Put  another  way,  the  UPnP  Device  Template  defines  the  overall  type  of  device,  and  each
UPnP  device  description  instantiates  that  template  with  vendor-specific  information.  The  first
is created by a UPnP Forum working committee; the latter, by a UPnP vendor.

2.5

Service description

The  UPnP  description  for  a  service  defines  actions  and  their  arguments,  and  state  variables
and their data type, range, and event characteristics.

Each service shall have zero or more actions. Each action shall have zero or more arguments.
Each argument is designated as either an input or an output argument. Input arguments shall
be  listed  first.  If  an  action  has  one  or  more  output  arguments,  the  first  output  argument  is
allowed  to  be  marked  as  a  return  value.  Each  argument  shall  correspond  to  one  of  the
<stateVariable> elements in the <serviceStateTable> in the SCPD.

Each service shall have one or more state variables.

In  addition  to  defining  non-standard  services,  UPnP  vendors are  allowed  to add  actions  and
services  to  standard  devices,  and  are  allowed  to  embed  standard  services  and  devices  in
non-standard devices.

To  illustrate  these  points,  below  is  a  listing  with  placeholders  (in  italics)  for  actual  elements
and values. For a standard UPnP service, some of these placeholders would be defined by a
UPnP  Forum  working  committee  (colored  red)  or  specified  by  a  UPnP  vendor  (purple).  For  a
non-standard  service,  all  of  these  placeholders  would  be  specified  by  a  UPnP  vendor.
Elements  defined  by  the  UPnP  Device  Architecture  are  colored  green.  Immediately  following
the listing is a detailed explanation of the elements, attributes, and values.

type

Allowed.  If  the  type  attribute  is  present,  the  value  of  the  <dataType>
element  shall  be  “string”.  The  value  of  the  type  attribute  overrides  the
“string” value; it defines the data type using a fully qualified data type name
according to the conventions of XML schema and can refer to XML Schema
simple types, service-local complex types and service-local extended simple
types.  Service-local  data  types  are  defined  in  a  corresponding  UPnP
Service Template or they are allowed to  be vendor-specific. See also clause
2.5.1,  “Defining  and  processing  extended  data  types”  and  claus e  2.5.2,
“String equivalents of extended data types”.

For example: <dataType type="xsd:byte">string</dataType>

For  a state variable  using  an  extended data  type via the  type  attribute and
containing  complex  data,  the  <defaultValue>,  <allowedValueList>
and  <allowedValueRange>  elements  shall  not  be  present.  In  such  case

shall not be present. Contains the following sub elements which shall have the same
type as the state variable:

<minimum>

Required.  Inclusive  lower  bound.  Defined  by  a  UPnP  Forum  working
committee or delegated to UPnP vendor. Single numeric value. The value of
the  <minimum>  element  shall  be  less  than  the  value  of  the  <maximum>
element.  If  a  working  committee  has  assigned  an  explicit  value  for  this
element, then vendors shall use that value. Otherwise, vendors shall choose
their own value, but always within the allowed range for the data type of this
state  variable.  If  the  working  committee  defines  an  allowed  range  for  this
state  variable,  then  the  value  shall  be  within  that  allowed  range  as  defined
by the <step> value (See below).

Required.  Inclusive  upper  bound.  Defined  by  a  UPnP  Forum  working
committee or delegated to UPnP vendor. Single numeric value. The value of
the  <maximum>  element  shall  be  greater  than  the  value  of  the <minimum>
element.  If  a  working  committee  has  assigned  an  explicit  value  for  this
element, then vendors shall use that value. Otherwise, vendors shall choose

state  variable,  then  the  value  shall  be  within  that  allowed  range  as  defined
by the <step> value (See below).

<step>

Recommended.  Defines  the  set  of  allowed  values  permitted  for  the  state
variable  between the <minimum> and <maximum>. The value of the <step>
element  divides  the  inclusive  range  from  <minimum>  value  to  <maximum>
value into an integral number of equal parts. Additionally,  <maximum>  value
=  <minimum>  value  +  n  *  <step>  value,  where  n  is  a  positive  integer.
Defined by a UPnP Forum working committee or del egated to UPnP vendor.
If a working committee has assigned an  explicit value for this element, then
vendors  shall  use  that  value.  Otherwise,  vendors  are  allowed  to  choose
their  own  value. When  the <step>  element  is  omitted  and  the  data  type  of
the  state  variable  is  an  integer,  the  default  value  of  step  is  1;    otherwise,

The  <allowedValueList>  and  <allowedValueRange>  elements  are  allowed  to  be  used
to  indicate  optional  device  capabilities.  Working  committees  are  allowed  to  REQUIRE  all
values  in  the  list  or  range  to  be  supported  by  all  vendors  (no  options),  REQUIRE  a  minimum
subset with additional values being allowed, or allow vendors to entirely decide which portions
of  the  list  or  range  to  support.  Vendors  are  allowed  to  add  additional,  vendor-specific  values
to  the  allowed  value  list  by  using  the  “X_”  prefix  on  the  vendor-defined  allowed  values,  if
permitted  by  working  committees.  However,  it  is  be  noted  that  greater  flexibility  in  allowed
capabilities  reduces  the  number  of  values  that  control  points  can  depend  on  to  be  present,
with  corresponding  impacts  on  interoperability.  If  device  capabilities  are  expected  to  change
during  device  operation,  working  committees  should  define  evented  state  variables  or
separate  actions  to  detect  device  capabilities  rather  than  embedding  capabilities  information
in  the  service  description,  because  the  latter  requires  cancellation  of  advertisements  and
readvertisement  each  time  the  service  description  document  is  changed.  If  the  service
description  is  used  to  convey  capabilities  information,  the  device shall  omit  from  the  service
description any allowed elements (actions, allowed values, etc.) that are not implemented.

For  a  state  variable  using  an  extended  data  type  via  the  type  attribute  and  containing
complex  data,  the  <defaultValue>,  <allowedValueList>  and  <allowedValueRange>
elements  shall  not  be  present.  In  such  case  the  restrictions  for  the  data  type  shall  be
described in the data type schema typically provided in the service template document.

Defining and processing extended data types

2.5.1
The  optional  type  attribute  of  the  <dataType>  element  as  defined  in  clause  2.5,  “Service
description”  above  allows  a  service  description  document  (SCPD)  to  include  extended  data
types  (defined  by  the  UPnP  technical  committee,  a  UPnP  working  committee  or  vendor-
specific data types) that have more structure and expression than the existing XSD data types.
As  mentioned  above,  this  type  attribute  can  only  be  applied  when  the  base  data  type  is  of
type  string.  The  value  attached  to  the  type  attribute  refers  to  a  data  type  from  a  separate
schema defined outside this document.

As a first RECOMMENDATION on the use of extended data types, if UPnP actions only have
simple  arguments,  these should  be  declared  using  UPnP  defined  data  types,  instead  of  XML
schema simple types. This enables use of such UPnP actions by UPnP 1.0 stacks that are not
XML-schema enabled.

As  a  further  RECOMMENDATION  on  extended  data  types  that  are  allowed  to  be  defined,
arrays should  be  declared  by using  a sequence  with an element  type of which the  number of
occurrences  is  restricted.  For  example,  if  an  array-type  “myArrayType”  of  50  long  integers
needs to be declared, this could be the corresponding schema fragment:

<xsd:complexType name="myArrayType">

<xsd:sequence>

<xsd:element name="x" type="xsd:long" minOccurs="50" maxOccurs="50"/>

</xsd:sequence>
</xsd:complexType>

References  to  this type (as  with any  XML  namespace) can  be  made  in  one  of  two ways.  The
first  option  is  a  fully  qualified  namespace  reference  in  the  type  attribute  alone.  In  this  case
the namespace reference in the type attribute shall not only refer to the schema, but also to
the type within that schema.

<scpd xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service-1-0"
 configId="configuration number">

...
<dataType type="urn:domain-name:schema-name:datatype-name">

string

</dataType>
...
</scpd>

The  second  option  is  to  define  the  namespace  at  the  beginning  of  the  SCPD  document  and
then make a reference in the type definition. In this case, the type attribute contains a prefix
that identifies the namespace, followed by the data type-named.

<scpd xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:service-1-0"
 xmlns:dt="urn:domain-name:schema-name"
 configId="configuration number">

...
<dataType type="dt:datatype-name">

string
</dataType>
...
</scpd>

Implementations  shall  support  both  formats.  The  first  format  is  potentially  easier  to  parse,
while the second format may result in shorter description files (i.e. when the same namespace
is used multiple times in the same document).

These  data  types  written  in  XSD  Schema  need  not  be  processed  at  run-time.  Instead,  an
implementer  is  allowed  to  use  the  referred  schema  as  a  standard  description  of  the  type  to
parse for that particular type attribute. To allow run-time schema processing of extended data
types,  an  optional  location  of  the  extended  data  type  schema  is  allowed  to  be  expressed  in
the SCPD using the standard XSD xsi:schemaLocation and xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation
attributes  as  defined  in  clause  4.3.2  of  XML  Schema  Part  1.  These  attributes  can  be  used  in
the  root  SCPD  element  (essentially  an  instance  document)  where  the  extended  data  type  is
defined, as illustrated below:

2.5.2

String equivalents of extended data types

A  number  of  working  committees  have  created  services  based  on  UPnP  1.0  (which  does  not
support  extended  data  types)  that  define  their  own  encoding  of  information  inside  specific
string-type  state  variables.  To  provide  these  working  committees  with  an  upgrade  path  to
extended  datatypes  written  in  native  XML 3 ,  a  mechanism  is  defined  that  gives  working
committees  the  option  to  define  the  “string  equivalent”  of  an  extended  data  type  (working
committees  can  decide  not  to).  If  a  string  equivalent  of  an  extended  data  type  is  defined,
there  are  two  valid  ways  to  represent  the  value  of  the  data  type:  either  as  an  extended  data
type,  written  in  native  XML,  or  as  a  string,  that  encodes  the  datatype  as  specified  by  the
working committee.

The  mechanism  uses  the  USER-AGENT  header  field  in  action  invocations  and  event
subscriptions (see also clause 2.1, “Generic requirements on HTTP usage”). If a control point
invokes  an  action  without  a  USER-AGENT  header  field,  or  if  the  USER-AGENT  header  field
does  not specify  UPnP version  2.0 or  greater,  the values of  in-arguments  and  out-arguments
shall be encoded using the “string equivalent”.

If  a  control  point  invokes  an  action  with  a  USER-AGENT  header  field  that  specifies  UPnP
version 2.0 or greater, the values of in-arguments and out-arguments shall be encoded using
the extended data type written in native XML.

If  a  control  point  has  subscribed  to  events  without  a  USER-AGENT  header  field,  or  if  the
USER-AGENT header field specifies a UPnP version less than 2.0, all values of complex-type
evented  state  variables  that  are  sent  to  the  control  point  shall  be  encoded  using  the  “string
equivalent”.  If  no  “string  equivalent”  is  defined  for  an  evented  state  variable,  subscription
without the correct USER-AGENT header field shall be refused.

3 In this text “native XML” refers to datatypes formatted according to XML-schema using the
normal XML format, while “string-equivalent of an extended datatype” refers to encoding a
complex data type inside a UPnP string, examples of which (escaped XML, comma-separated
lists) can be found in the ContentDirectory:1 specification.

If  a  control  point  has  subscribed  to  events  with  a  USER-AGENT  header  field  that  specifies
UPnP version  2.0  or  greater, all values  of complex-type evented state variables that  are sent
to the control point shall be encoded using the extended data type written in native XML.

2.5.3

Generic requirements

For future extensibility and according to the requirements in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor
extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  when  processing  XML  like  the  listing
above,  devices  and  control  points  shall  ignore:  (a)  any  unknown  elements  and  their  sub
elements or content, and (b) any unknown attributes and their values.

Subject to the constraints defined in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor extensions” and clause
2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or
XML  processing  instructions  embedded  in UPnP  device  and service descriptions  that they do
not understand. UPnP service descriptions shall be encoded using UTF-8.

When  the value of  any text  element or attribute contains  one or more characters reserved  as
markup (such as ampersand (“&”) or less than (“<”)), the text shall be escaped in accordance
with  the  provisions  of clause  2.4  of  the  XML  specification  and  each  such  character  replaced
with  the  equivalent  numeric  representation  or  string  (such  as  “&amp;”  or  “&lt;”).  Such
characters appearing in URLs are allowed to also be percent-encoded in accordance with the
URL  percent-encoding  rules  specified  in  clauses  2.1  and  2.4  of  RFC  3986.  Note  that  it  is
logically  possible  for  a  service  to  have  no  actions  but  have  state  variables  and  eventing;
though  unlikely,  such  a  service  would  be  an  autonomous  information  source.  However,  a
service with no state variables is PROHIBITED.

Unlike  device  descriptions,  service  descriptions  and  associated  values  shall  not  use  locale-
specific  values;  this  includes  service  descriptions,  values  of  action  arguments,  and  values  of
state  variables.  Instead,  most  action  arguments  and  state  variables shall  use  values  that  are
expressed  in  a  locale-independent  manner;  control  points  are  allowed  to  convert  and/or
format  the  information  from  a  standard  form  into  the  correct  language  and/or  format  for  the
locale.  For  example,  dates  are  represented  in  a  locale-independent  format  (ISO  8601),  and
integers  are  represented  without  locale-specific  formatting  (e.g.,  no  currency  symbol,  no
grouping  of  digits).  String  values  shall  be  represented  in  a  locale-independent  manner.
Variables with an allowedValueList shall use token values in the language of UPnP standards
and not reflect strings intended to be displayed in a localized user interface.

2.5.4

Ordering of Elements

The  order  of  XML  elements  in  device  and  service  description  documents shall  adhere  to  the
order  as  defined  in  the  corresponding  specification  as  defined  by  the  working  committee  for
that  device  or  service  type.  Furthermore,  the  order  of  elements  (e.g.  arguments)  in  control
messages  and  in  their  responses  shall  adhere  to  the  order  defined  in  the  device’s  service
description document.

Note:  UPnP  1.0  does  NOT  REQUIRE  that  the  order  of  XML  elements  in  device  and  service
description  documents  adheres  to  the  order  as  defined  in  the  corresponding  schema  (as
defined  by  the  working  committee)  for  that  device  or  service  type.    However,  it  does
REQUIRE  that  control  messages  and  responses  are  ordered  according  to  the  corresponding
device’s  service  description,  a  REQUIREMENT  that  is  sometimes  overlooked.  Therefore,
when  receiving  messages  from  UPnP  1.0  services,  control  points should  be  able  to  process
out-of-order  elements;  and  when  transmitting  messages  to  UPnP  1.0  services,  control  points
shall send elements in the order defined by that particular device’s service description.

2.5.5

Versioning

Services  standardized  by  UPnP  Forum  working  committees  have  an  integer  version.  Every
later  version  of  a  service shall  be  a  superset  of  the  previous  version,  i.e.,  it shall  include  all
actions and state variables exactly as they are defined by earlier versions of the service. The
UPnP  service  type  remains  the  same  across  all  versions  of  a  service  whereas  the  service
version  shall  be  larger  for  later  versions.  Versions  of  device  and  service  templates  are

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 65 —

allowed  to  have  non-integer  versions  (such  as  “0.9”)  during  development  in  the  working
committee,  but  this shall  become  an  integer  upon  standardization. Devices  and  services  are
allowed  to have  a  version  number  greater  than  the  major  version  number  of  the  architecture
they are designed for (e.g., “Power:2” may be designed to work on UDA version 1.0).

2.6  UPnP Service Template

The  listing  above  also  illustrates  the  relationship  between  a UPnP  service  description  and  a
UPnP Service Template. As explained above, the UPnP description for a service is written by
a  UPnP  vendor,  in  XML,  following  a  UPnP  Service  Template.  A  UPnP  Service  Template  is
produced by a UPnP Forum working committee as a means to standardize devices.

By  appropriate  specification  of  placeholders,  the  listing  above  can  be  either  a  UPnP  Service
Template or a UPnP service description. Recall that some placeholders would be defined by a
UPnP  Forum  working  committee  (colored  red),  i.e.,  actions  and  their  parameters,  and  states
and their data type, range, and event characteristics. If these were specified, the listing above
would be a UPnP Service Template, codifying the standard for this type of service. Along with
UPnP  Device  Templates  (see  clause  2,  “Description”),  UPnP  Service  Templates  are  one  of
the key deliverables from UPnP Forum working committees.

Taking  this  another  step  further,  the  remaining  placeholders  in  the  listing  above  would  be
specified  by  a  UPnP  vendor  (colored  purple),  i.e.,  additional,  vendor-specified  actions  and
state variables. If these  placeholders  were specified (as  well  as the  others),  the  listing  would
be a UPnP service description, suitable for effective control of the service within a device.

Put  another  way,  the  UPnP  Service  Template  defines  the  overall  type  of  service,  and  each
UPnP service description instantiates that template with vendor-specific additions. The first is
created by a UPnP Forum working committee; the latter by a UPnP vendor.

2.7  Non-standard vendor extensions and limitations

As  explained  above,  UPnP  vendors  are  allowed  to  differentiate  their  devices  and  extend  a
standard  device  by  including  additional  services  and  embedded  devices.  Similarly,  UPnP
vendors  are  allowed  to  extend  a  standard  service  by  including  additional  actions,  state
variables or allowed values. Naming conventions and conditions for each of these are listed in
the table below and explained in detail above.

As  the  last  two rows  of  the table above  indicate,  UPnP vendors  are  allowed to also  add  non-
standard  XML  to  a device or service  description.  Each  addition  shall be scoped by  a vendor-
owned XML namespace. Arbitrary XML shall be enclosed in an element that begins with “X_,”
and  this element shall  be  a sub element of  a standard complex type. Non-standard  attributes
are  allowed  to  be  added  to  standard  elements  provided  these  attributes  are  scoped  by  a
vendor-owned XML namespace and begin with “X_”.

To  illustrate  this,  below  are  listings  with  placeholders  (in  italics)  for  actual  elements  and
values.  Some  of  these  placeholders  would  be  specified  by  a  UPnP  vendor  (purple)  and  some
are defined by the UPnP Device Architecture (green).

<RootStandardElement

<AnyStandardElement n:X_VendorAttribute="arbitrary string value">

<!-- other XML -->
</RootStandardElement>

<RootStandardElement>

A standard root element. xmlns  attribute defines namespaces, in this case, a standard UPnP namespace and
a non-standard namespace with the prefix n. (Note: n is just a placeholder. A vendor can specify any prefix to
identify the namespace that is valid according to the Namespaces in XML specification.)

•  For service descriptions, shall be <scpd>.

<AnyStandardElement>

Any standard element, root or otherwise, content of text or element only. Shall  already be included as

2.7.1

Placement of Additional Elements and Attributes

Instances  of  any  UPnP  schema,  including  device  and  service  descriptions,  control  actions,
errors  and  event  notifications,  are  allowed  to  include  additional  XML  elements  (other  than
those  defined  by  the  UPnP  Forum)  only  at  the  end  of  an  ordered  sequence  of  elements

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 67 —

corresponding  to  a  given  complex  type.  Additionally,  instances  of  any  UPnP  schema  are
allowed to include additional attributes with any element.

Exception for UPnP 1.0 devices:

UPnP  1.0  allows  the  inclusion  of  additional  elements  anywhere  within  device  and  service
descriptions,  control  actions,  errors  and  event  notifications,  provided  that  the  XML  is  well-
formed.  Therefore,  when  receiving  messages  from  UPnP  1.0  devices,  control  points  shall
handle unknown elements and attributes found anywhere within the message.

2.8  UPnP Device Schema

The  paragraphs  above  explain  UPnP  device  descriptions  and  illustrate  how  one  would  be
instantiated  from  a  UPnP  Device  Template.  As  explained,  UPnP  Device  Templates  are
produced  by  UPnP  Forum  working  committees,  and  these  templates  are  based  upon  the
UPnP  Device  Schema.  This  schema  defines  the  structures  and  data  types  used  to  create
UPnP  Device  Templates. clause  B.1,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”  contains  the  schema;  below  is
an explanation of this schema.

The UPnP Device Schema is written in XML and according to the conventions of XML Schema
(Part  1:  Structures,  Part  2:  Datatypes).  XML  Schema  provides  a  method  of  describing  the
structure  of  an  XML  document.  The  XML  Schema  description  language  itself  is  based  upon
XML.  The  language  is  very  robust;  it  specifies  which  elements  are  required  vs.  allowed,
element  nesting,  data  types  for  values  (as  well  as  other  properties  not  of  interest  here)  and
much  more.  The  UPnP  Device  Schema  uses  these  XML  Schema  constructions  to  define
elements  like  <specVersion> ,  <URLBase>,  <deviceType>,  etc.,  listed  in  detail  above.
Because  the  UPnP  Device  Schema  is  constructed  using  a  precise  description  language,  it  is
unambiguous.  As  the  UPnP  Device  Schema,  UPnP  Device  Templates,  and  UPnP  device
descriptions are all machine-readable, software tools are allowed to be devised to validate the
latter two, checking that they contain all the required elements, are correctly nested, and have
values of the correct data types.

2.9  UPnP Service Schema

The  paragraphs  above  explain  UPnP  service  descriptions  and  illustrate  how  one  would  be
instantiated  from  a  UPnP  Service  Template.  Like  UPnP  Device  Templates,  UPnP  Service
Templates are produced by UPnP Forum working committees, and these templates are based
upon  the  UPnP  Service  Schema.  This  schema  defines  the  structure  and  data  types  used  to
create UPnP Service Templates. As explained above, the UPnP Service Schema is written in
XML  according  to  the  conventions  of  XML  Schema  (Part  1:  Structures,  Part  2:  Datatypes).
clause B.2, “UPnP Service Schema” contains a listing of this schema

2.10  UPnP Datatype Schema

The UPnP basic data types for state variables are defined in clause 2.5, “Service description”.
For  any  extended  data  types  for  state  variables  used  by  a  service  template,  the  service
template  shall  include  either  a  reference  to  all  relevant  schemas  for  the  extended  data  types
or  include  a  new  service  specific  datatype  schema  with  a  corresponding  unique  target
namespace.  If  any  extended  data  types  are  used  for  state  variables  within  an  SCPD,  the
corresponding  namespace  for  each  extended  data  type shall  be  referenced  within  the  SCPD
according  to  the  “Namespaces  in  XML”  specification.  Clause  2.5,  “Service  description”
contains an example SCPD with namespace declarations.

2.11  Retrieving a description using HTTP

As  explained  above,  after  a  control  point  has  discovered  a  device,  it  still  knows  very  little
about  the  device.  To  learn  more  about  the  device  and  its  capabilities,  the  control  point shall
retrieve  the  UPnP  description  for  the  device  using  the  URL  provided  by  the  device  in  the
discovery  message.  Then,  the  control  point  shall  retrieve  one  or  more  service  descriptions
using  the  URL(s)  provided  in  the  device  description.  This  is  a  simple  HTTP-based  process
and uses the following subset of the overall UPnP protocol stack. (The overall UPnP protocol
stack is listed at the beginning of this document.)

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 68 —

A multi-homed device shall send description documents using the UPnP-enabled interface on
which  the  HTTP  GET  request  was  received.  To  retrieve  the  UPnP  description  using  a
particular  interface,  a  multi-homed  control  point  shall  use  the  URL  provided  in  the  discovery
message which arrived on that interface.

UPnP vendor [purple-italic]

UPnP Forum [red-italic]

UPnP Device Architecture [green-bold]

HTTP [black]

TCP [black]

IP [black]

At  the  highest  layer,  description  messages  contain  vendor-specific  information,  e.g.,  device
type,  service  type,  and  required  services.  Moving  down  the  stack,  vendor  content  is
supplemented  by  information  from  a  UPnP  Forum  working  committee,  e.g.,  model  name,
model  number,  and  specific  URLs.  Messages  from  the  layers  above  are  hosted  in  UPnP-
specific  protocols,  defined  in  this  document.  In  turn,  the  above  messages  are  delivered  via
HTTP  over  TCP  over  IP.  For  reference,  colors  in  [square  brackets]  above  indicate  which
protocol  defines  specific  header  fields  and  body  elements  in  the  description  messages  listed
below.

When a control point discovers a device on the network, it are allowed to wish to retrieve the
Device  Description  document  and  Service  Description  Documents.  Retrieving  the  UPnP
device description is simple: the control point issues an HTTP GET request to the URL in the
discovery  message,  and  the  device  returns  its  description  in  the  body  of  an  HTTP  response.
Similarly,  to  retrieve  a  UPnP  service  description,  the  control  point  issues  an  HTTP  GET
request  to  the  corresponding  URL  in  the  device  description,  and  the  device  returns  the
description  in  the  body  of  an  HTTP  response.  The  header  fields  and  body  for  the  response
and request are explained in detail below.

First,  a control  point  shall send  a request with method GET  in  the  following format.  Values  in
italics are placeholders for actual values.

GET /descriptionPath HTTP/1.1
HOST: hostname:portNumber
ACCEPT-LANGUAGE: language preferred by control point

(No  body  for  request  to  retrieve  a  description,  but  note  that  the  message  shall  have  a  blank
line following the last HTTP header field.)

Listed  below  are  details  for  the  request  line  and  header  fields  appearing  in  the  listing  above.
Field  names  are  not  case  sensitive.  All  field  values  are  case  sensitive  except  where  noted.
See RFC 2616 and RFC 1945 for further requirements on encoding of values of these fields.

Request line

GET

Method defined by HTTP. Can be GET or HEAD.

qualified  service  description  URL.  (If  the  SCPDURL  sub  element  of  the  service  element  in  the  device
description  is  an  absolute  URL,  the  fully  qualified  service  description  URL  is  the  SCPDURL  sub  element.
Otherwise (the SCPDURL sub element is a relative URL), the fully qualified service description URL is the URL
resolved from the SCPDURL sub element in accordance with clause  5 of RFC 3986, using either the URLBase

of  the  version  specified). are  allowed  to  be  any  HTTP  version  that  is  backwards  compatible  to  HTTP/1.0  (like
HTTP/1.1).

Header fields
HOST

Required. Field value contains domain name or IP address and optional port components of device description
URL  (LOCATION  header  field  in  discovery  message)  or  of  the  fully  qualified  service  description  URL.  (If  the
SCPDURL sub element of the  service element in the  device  description is  an  absolute  URL, the fully qualified
service  description  URL  is  the  SCPDURL  sub  element.  Otherwise  (the  SCPDURL  sub  element  is  a  relative
URL),  the  fully  qualified  service  description  URL  is  the  URL  resolved  from  the  SCPDURL  sub  element  in
accordance with clause  5 of RFC 3986, using either the URLBase element, if specified, or the URL from which
the device description was retrieved as the base URL.) If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed.

ACCEPT-LANGUAGE

Allowed.  Recommended  for  retrieving  device  descriptions.  Field  value  contains  preferred  language(s)  for
description. If no description is available in this language, device is allowed to  return a description in a default
language. See RFC 1766 language tag(s).

After  a  control  point  sends  a  request,  the  device  takes  the  second  step  and  responds  with  a
copy of its description. Including expected transmission  time, a device shall respond within 30
seconds.  If it  fails  to  respond within  this  time, the control point  should re-send  the request.  A
device  shall  send  a  response  in  the  following  format  and  in  accordance  with  clause  2.1,
“Generic  requirements  on  HTTP  usage”.  Two  example  responses  are  provided  below:  one
that  uses  the  CONTENT-LENGTH  header  field,  and  one  that  uses  chunked  encoding  (with  2
chunks).  Values in italics are placeholders for actual values.

Note:  XML  namespace  prefixes  do  not  have  to  be  the  specific  examples  shown  below  (e.g.,
“s”  or  “u”);  they  can  be  any  value  that  obeys  the  rules  of  the  general  XML  namespace
mechanism;  a  device  shall  accept  action  invocations  that  use  other  legal  XML  namespace
prefixes.

Required  if  Origin  Server  does  not  close  the  session  after  sending  the  response  AND  Origin  Server  does  not
send the response using chunked encoding.

PROHIBITED if Origin Server sends the response using chunked encoding. Allowed otherwise.

Field value specifies the length of the body in bytes. Integer.

TRANSFER-ENCODING

Allowed  for  HTTP/1.1  and  above.  Field  value  specifies  whether  the  response  is  chunked  encoded  by  having
field value “chunked”. Shall NOT be specified if CONTENT-LENGTH header field is present.

CONTENT-TYPE

Required. Field value shall be “text/xml; charset="utf-8" ” for description documents.

DATE

Recommended according to RFC 2616, clause  14.18. Field value contains date when response was generated.
“rfc1123-date” as defined in RFC 2616.

SERVER

(No SERVER header field is required for description messages.)

Note  that  because  HTTP  1.1  allows  use  of  chunked  encoding,  some  devices  are  allowed  to
send  the  description  using  chunked  encoding  if  the  GET  request  specifies  HTTP  1.1.
Therefore  all  implementations  that  include  HTTP  1.1  client  support  shall  support  receiving
chunked encoding.

3  Control

Control is Step 3 in UPnP networking. Control comes after addressing (Step 0) where devices
get a network address, after discovery (Step 1) where control points find interesting device(s),
and  after  description  (Step  2)  where  control  points  learn  about  device  capabilities.  Control  is
independent  of  eventing  (Step  4)  where  control  points  listen  to  state  changes  in  device(s).
Through  control,  control  points  invoke  actions  on  devices  and  poll  for  values.  Control  and
eventing  are  complementary  to  presentation  (Step  5)  where  control  points  display  a  user
interface provided by device(s).

Given knowledge of a device and its services, a control point can ask those services to invoke
actions and receive responses indicating the result of the action. Invoking actions is a kind of
remote  procedure call;  a control point sends  the  action to the  device's service, and  when  the
action has completed (or failed), the service returns any results or errors.

To  control  a  device,  a  control  point  invokes  an  action  on  the  device's  service.  To  do  this,  a
control  point  sends  a  suitable  control  message  to  the  fully  qualified  control  URL  for  the
service  obtained  from  the  controlURL  sub  element  of  the  service  element  of  the  device
description. If the controlURL sub element is an absolute URL, the fully qualified control URL
for  the  service  is  the  controlURL  sub  element.  Otherwise  (the  controlURL  sub  element  is  a

relative  URL),  the  fully  qualified  control  URL  for  the  service  is  the  URL  resolved  from  the
controlURL sub element in accordance with clause  5 of RFC 3986, using either the URLBase
element  of  the  device  description,  if  specified,  or  the  URL  from  which  the  device  description
was  retrieved  as  the  base  URL.  A  multi-homed  control  point  that  sends  the  control  message
on  a  particular  interface  shall  use  the  fully  qualified  control  URL  from  the  description
document  received  on  that  interface.  In  response,  the  service  returns  any  results  or  errors
from the action. The effects of the action, if any, is also allowed to be modeled by changes in
the  variables  that  describe  the  run-time  state  of  the  service.  When  these  state  variables
change, events are published to all interested control points. This clause explains the protocol
stack for, and format of, control messages. Clause 4, “Eventing” explains event publication.

Working  committees  and  vendors  are  allowed  to  define  actions  to  allow  control  points  to
determine  the  current  value  of  one  or  more  state  variables.  Similar  to  invoking  an  action,  a
control point sends the defined query message to the control URL for the service. In response,
the  service  provides  the  value  of  the  variable  or  variables;  each  service  is  responsible  for
keeping its state table consistent so control points can poll and receive meaningful values for
those  state  variables  for  which  query  actions  are  defined.  Clause  4,  “Eventing”explains
automatic notification of variable values.

As  long  as  one  of  the  discovery  advertisements  from  a  device  have  not  expired,  a  control
point  is  allowed  to assume  that  the  device  and  its  services  are  available.  If  a  device  cancels
at least one of its advertisements, a control point shall assume the device and its services are
no longer available.

Control points and devices shall use UTF-8 for all UPnP control messages and responses.

While  UDA  does  define  a means  to invoke  actions and poll for values,  UDA  does  not specify
or  constrain  the  design  of  an  API  for  applications  running  on  control  points;  OS  vendors  are
allowed to create APIs that suit their customers’ needs.

If  a  large  amount  of  data  needs  to  be  sent  in  association  with  an  action  (particularly  if  the
amount of data is not known in advance), it is not recommended to send the data as part of a
SOAP argument or as a MIME attachment to the SOAP message. Instead, it is recommended
that  out-of-band  transfer  be  used.  For  example,  a  URL  could  be  sent  as  an  argument  value,
and an HTTP GET, PUT, or POST be used to transfer the data. HTTP chunked encoding can
be used when the amount of data is not known in advance.

Responses to SOAP messages during the Control phase shall be sent to the same IP address
from  which  the  request  was  received.  Any  fully-qualified  URLs  contained  in  an  action  or
response that refer to a resource on the device itself shall have the HOST portion of the URL
set appropriately so that the resource will be reachable by the control point that requested the
action.  This  might  be  accomplished  by  using  the  field  value  specified  in  the  HTTP  HOST
header field of the control request.

Services  that  use  complex  datatype  arguments  shall  follow  the  requirements  in  clause  2.5,
“Service description”

The remainder  of this clause  explains  in  detail  how control  messages  are  formatted and sent
to devices.

3.1  Control protocols

To invoke actions and poll for values, control points (and devices) use the following subset of
the overall UPnP protocol stack. (The overall UPnP protocol stack is listed at the beginning of
this document.)

Figure 3-2: — Control protocol stack

UPnP vendor [purple-italic]

UPnP Forum [red-italic]

UPnP Device Architecture [green-bold]

SOAP [blue]

HTTP [black]

TCP [black]

IP [black]

At  the  highest  layer,  control  messages  contain  vendor-specific  information,  e.g.,  argument
values.  Moving  down  the  stack,  vendor  content  is  supplemented  by  information  from  a  UPnP
Forum  working  committee,  e.g.,  action  names,  argument  names,  variable  names.  Messages
from the layers above are hosted in UPnP-specific protocols, defined in this document. In turn,
the  above  messages  are  formatted  using  a  Simple  Object  Access  Protocol  (SOAP)  header
and  body  elements,  and  the  messages  are  delivered  via  HTTP  over  TCP  over  IP.  For
reference,  colors  in  [square  brackets]  above  indicate  which  protocol  defines  specific  header
field elements in the subscription messages listed below.

The  generic  requirements  on  HTTP  usage  in  UPnP  2.0  (as  defined  in  clause  2.1,  “Generic
requirements  on  HTTP  usage”  of  this  document)  shall  be  followed  by  devices  and  control
points that implement Control.

3.1.1

SOAP Profile

UPnP  profiles  SOAP  1.1,  NOT  REQUIRING  that  all  devices  support  all  allowed  features  of
SOAP  1.1,  but  devices  and  control  points shall  support  all mandatory  features  of  SOAP  1.1.
The following table summarizes the UPnP profiling of SOAP.

SOAP <Header> element

UPnP  working  committees  and  the  UPnP  technical  committee is  allowed  to  define  allowed  or
mandatory  SOAP  header  entries  that  are  included  in  the  SOAP  <Header>  element  of  UPnP
action and UPnP action response messages. In addition, vendors are allowed to include other
SOAP  header  entries  in  the  SOAP  <Header>  element  of  UPnP  action  and  UPnP  action
response  messages.  If  there  are  no  SOAP  header  entries  in  a  message,  the  SOAP  <Header>
element can be omitted.

SOAP mustUnderstand Attribute of <Header> element
The  mustUnderstand attribute shall not be  added to  SOAP <Header>  element targeted at (see
also  actor  attribute  below)  standardized  UPnP  services  or  targeted  at  control  points  that
interact  with  standardized  UPnP  services,  unless  its  use  has  been  explicitly  defined  by  the
UPnP technical committee or a working committee (e.g. UPnP security).

The mustUnderstand header attribute shall not be included on non-standard header entries that
are  targeted  at  (see  also  actor  attribute)  standardized  services,  as  this  breaks  the  basic
interoperability  of  UPnP.  mustUnderstand  header  entries  are  allowed  to  be  included  on  non-
standard  header  entries  that  are  neither  targeted  at  (see  also  actor  attribute)  standardized
services  (e.g.  vendor  defined  services),  nor  targeted  at  control  points  interacting  with
standardized services.

The mustUnderstand attribute is

The mustUnderstand attribute is

All unknown <Hea der> entries are

defined differently by a working
committee (UPnP Security).

All devices shall honor the actor (see
actor clause below) and
mustUnderstand attributes. If a
header entry with
mustUnderstand="1" is not
understood, the whole message fails
and a <Faultcode> element shall be
returned.

The  SOAP  mustUnderstand  attribute  has  a  restricted  type  of  "xsd:boolean"  that  takes  only  “0”
or “1” with “1” being true and “0” being false. A header entry with the mustUnderstand attribute
set  to  a  value  of  “1”  shall  be  processed  by  targeted  nodes  or  message  processing  shall  fail.
Such  elements  are  considered  “mandatory  header  entries”.  A  SOAP  node  is  considered  to
understand  a  SOAP  header  entry  if  that  SOAP  node  understands  the  semantics  specified  for
the  XML  expanded  name  of  the  outer-most  element  information  item  of  that  header  entry.
Mandatory SOAP header entries are presumed to modify the semantics of other SOAP header
entries  or  SOAP  <Body>  elements  and  therefore  shall  be  understood  for  correct  semantics.
UPnP  nodes  receiving  header  entries  flagged  with  the  mustUnderstand  attribute  shall  process
and  understand  mandatory  header  entries  that  are  targeted  at  that  node  or  the  node  shall
NOT process the SOAP message at all. If a node  fails to process or understand a mandatory
entry,  that  node  shall  generate  a  SOAP  Fault  with  the  <faultcode>  element  set  to
"MustUnderstand". Support for mandatory header entries assures that key message parts that
are targeted at a particular SOAP node will not be erroneously ignored.

If  a  <Header>  entry  is  a  mandatory  <Header>  entry  and  contains  entries  not  understood  by

that processes the message. The lack of an actor attribute indicates that the entry is targeted
at the destination. All UPnP defined <Header> elements shall be targeted at the destination,
unless explicitly defined  otherwise  by the  UPnP  technical committee  or a  working committee.

points  might  ignore  the  actor  attribute  and  parse  a  <Header>  entry  that  is  not  intended  for
them.

If  <Header>  entries  with  an  actor  attribute  are  targeted  at  an  intermediary  and  tagged
mustUnderstand="1",  the  device  or  control  point shall  not  return  a  SOAP  Fault  containing  the
<faultcode>  element  set  to  "MustUnderstand"  due  to  failure  to  process  the  relevant
<Header> element targeted at another entity.

UPnP 2.0 REQUIRES that the first child element of the <Body> element shall be the root of the

serialization root should not use the root attribute, but it is NOT PROHIBITED.

Responses. The actual entries are derived from the Service Description for the chosen Action.
A response is either successful, in which case it contains output arguments, or unsuccessful,
when it contains a  <Fault> element as the only entry.

recognize  the  element  or  return  the  appropriate  SOAP  <Fault>  element,  containing  the
<faultcode>  element  set  to  “MustUnderstand”.  Backwards-compatible  services  shall  not  use
mandatory  <Header>  elements  since  previous  UDAs  allowed  unknown  <Header>  elements
to be ignored.

Acceptable SOAP Character Encodings

All  messages  shall  use  UTF-8  serialization.  The  device  or  control  point  shall  indicate  the
content type for all control messages using the HTTP “charset” parameter.

3.2  Actions

Control  points  are  allowed  to  invoke  actions  on  a  device's  services  and  receive  results  or
errors  back.  The  action,  results,  and  errors  are  encapsulated  in  SOAP,  sent  via  HTTP
requests, and received via HTTP responses.

3.2.1

Action invocation

The  Simple  Object  Access  Protocol  (SOAP)  defines  the  use  of  XML  and  HTTP  for  remote
procedure  calls.  UPnP  2.0  uses  HTTP  to  deliver  SOAP  1.1  encoded  control  messages  to
devices  and  return  results  or  errors  back  to  control  points.  See  clause  2.1,  “Generic
requirements on HTTP usage” on use of HTTP in UPnP 2.0.

UPnP  2.0  deprecates  the  use  of  the  HTTP  Extension  Framework    (RFC  2774)  for  control.
Specifically,  control  points shall  send  a  request  with  method  POST  and  shall  not  use  the  M-
POST  method.  Devices  shall  not  reject  POST  methods  with  a  “405  Method  Not  Allowed”
HTTP status code since this causes UPnP 1.0 control points to issue a request using M-POST.

Below  is  a  listing  of  a  control  message  sent  using  the  POST  method  followed  by  an
explanation of the header fields and body. To invoke an action on a device's service, a control
point  shall  send  a  request  with  method  POST  in  the  following  format.    Two  examples  are
provided: one using the CONTENT-LENGTH header and one using chunked encoding (with 2
chunks).  Values in italics are placeholders for actual values.

Note:  XML  namespace  prefixes  do  not  have  to  be  the  specific  examples  shown  below  (e.g.,
“s”  or  “u”);  they  can  be  any  value  that  obeys  the  rules  of  the  general  XML  namespace
mechanism;  a  device  shall  accept  action  invocations  that  use  other  legal  XML  namespace
prefixes.

defined  in  version  K  of  a  service,  version  number  v shall  be  equal  or  higher  than  K.  For  example,  if  an  action
has been defined in version 2 of a service, it shall not be invoked using v=1. Furthermore; version v shall  be a

the  service  type  enclosed  in  double  quotes.  The  version  specified  shall  be  the  same  version
specified in the SOAPACTION header field. Case sensitive. shall  be the first child element of
<Body>. Contains the following, ordered sub element(s):

<argumentName>

Required if and only if action has in arguments. Value to be passed to action. Repeat
once  for  each  in  argument.  (An  element  name  is  not  qualified  by  a  namespace;
element nesting context is sufficient.) Case sensitive. Single data type as defined by
UPnP  service  description.  Every  “in”  argument  in  the  definition  of  the  action  in  the
service  description  shall  be  included,  in  the  same  order  as  specified  in  the  service
description (SCPD) that is available from the device.

If the CONTENT-TYPE header field specifies an unsupported field value (other then “text/xml”)
the device shall return a “415 Unsupported Media Type” HTTP status code.

For future extensibility and according to the requirements in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor
extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  when  processing  XML  like  the  listing
above,  devices  and  control  points  shall  ignore:  (a)  any  unknown  elements  and  their  sub
elements or content, and (b) any unknown attributes and their values.

Subject to the constraints defined in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor extensions” and clause
2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or
XML processing instructions embedded in action requests that they do not understand.

When  the  value  of  any  argument  contains  one  or  more  characters  reserved  as  markup  (such
as  ampersand (“&”) or  less than  (“<”)),  then  the text shall  be  escaped  in  accordance with the
provisions  of clause  2.4  of  the  XML  specification  and  each  such  character  replaced  with  the

equivalent  numeric  representation  or  string  (such  as  “&amp;”  or  “&lt;”).  Such  characters
appearing  in  URLs  are  also  allowed  to  be  percent-encoded  in  accordance  with  the  URL
percent-encoding rules specified in clauses  2.1 and 2.4 of RFC 3986.

Note that because HTTP 1.1 allows use of chunked encoding, some control points are allowed
to  send  the  action  request  using  chunked  encoding  if  the  POST  method  specifies  HTTP  1.1.
Device  implementations  that  only  support  HTTP/1.0  and  thus  do  not  support  receiving  action
requests  using  chunked  encoding  shall  return  a  “505  HTTP  Version  Not  Supported”  HTTP
status code.  Control  points shall not make HTTP  1.1 chunked  POST requests  to devices that
are known to support only HTTP 1.0.

On a multi-homed control point, all fully qualified URLs contained in the action arguments that
refer to resources on the control point shall be reachable on the interface on which the action
request is sent.

3.2.2

Action Response

The  service  shall  complete  invoking  the  action  and  respond  within  30  seconds,  including
expected  transmission  time  (measured  from  the  time  the  action  message  is  transmitted  until
the  time  the  associated  response  is  received).  Actions  that  take  longer  than  this  should  be
defined to return early and send an event when complete. If the service fails to respond within
this  time,  what  the  control  point  should  do  is  application-specific.  A  multi-homed  device  shall
send  the  response  on  the  same  UPnP-enabled  interface  on  which  the  request  was  received.
The  service  shall  send  a  successful  completion  response  using  the  following  format.    The
following  two  examples  illustrate  an  action  response  using  the  CONTENT-LENGTH  header
and  an  action   response  using  chunked  encoding.    The  values  in  italics  are  placeholders  for
actual values.

Note;  XML  namespace  prefixes  do  not  have  to  be  the  specific  examples  shown  below  (e.g.,
“s”  or  “u”);  they  can  be  any  value  that  obeys  the  rules  of  the  general  XML  namespace
mechanism; control points shall accept action responses that use other legal XML namespace
prefixes.

as  defined  by  UPnP  service  description.  Every  out  argument  in  the  definition  of  the
action  in  the  service  description shall  be  included,  in  the  same  order  as  specified  in
the service description (SCPD) available from the device.

For future extensibility and according to the requirements in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor
extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  when  processing  XML  like  the  listing
above,  devices  and  control  points  shall  ignore:  (a)  any  unknown  elements  and  their  sub
elements or content, and (b) any unknown attributes and their values.

Subject to the constraints defined in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor extensions” and clause
2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or
XML processing instructions embedded in action responses that they do not understand.

On a  multi-homed  device,  all  fully  qualified  URLs  contained  in  response arguments that refer
to  resources  on  the  device  shall  be  reachable  on  the  UPnP-enabled  interface  on  which  the
response message is sent.

3.2.3

UPnP Action Schema

The  UPnP  Action  Schema  defines  the  structures  and  data  types  used  in  the  body  of  UPnP
actions  and  action responses.  As explained with  the  UPnP  Device  and  Service Schemas, the
UPnP  Action  Schema  is  written  in  XML  syntax  according  to  the  conventions  of  XML  Schema
(Part  1:  Structures,  Part  2:  Datatypes).  The  UPnP  Action  Schema  is  defined  within  a  UPnP
service  template;  however,  the  schema  shall  conform  to  the  format  as  defined  in  clause  B.3,
“UPnP Control Schema”. The elements it defines are used in actions and action responses.

3.2.4

Recommendations and additional requirements

Control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or  XML  processing  instructions
they may receive that they do not understand.

XML  namespace  prefixes  do  not  have  to  be  the  specific  examples  given  above  (e.g.,  “s”  or
“u”);  they  can  be  any  value  that  obeys  the  rules  of  the  general  XML  namespace  mechanism;
control points shall accept responses that use other legal XML namespace prefixes.

If  an  action  has  no  “out”  arguments,  it  is  valid  to  combine  the  opening  and  closing  XML  tags
of
(e.g.,
“<actionNameResponse></actionNameResponse>”).

“<actionNameResponse/>”

instead

When  the  value  of  any  argument  contains  one  or  more  characters  reserved  as  markup  (such
as  ampersand  (“&”)  or  less  than  (“<”)),  the  text  shall  be  escaped  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of clause  2.4  of  the  XML  specification  and  each  such  character  replaced  with  the
equivalent  numeric  representation  or  string  (such  as  “&amp;”  or  “&lt;”).  Such  characters
appearing  in  URLs  are  also  allowed  to  be  percent-encoded  in  accordance  with  the  URL
percent-encoding rules specified in clauses 2.1 and 2.4 of RFC 3986.

3.2.5

Action error response

Where  the  normal  outcome  of  processing  a  SOAP  message  would  have  resulted  in  the
transmission  of  a  SOAP  response,  but  rather  a  SOAP  Fault  is  generated  instead,  a  receiver
shall  transmit  a  SOAP  Fault  message  in  place  of  the  response.  If  the  service  encounters  an
error  while  invoking  the  action  sent  by  a  control  point,  the  service  shall  send  a  response
within 30 seconds, including expected transmission time. Out arguments shall only be used to
return  data  and  shall  not  be  used  to  convey  error  information.  Error  responses shall  be  sent
using the following format.  The following two examples illustrate an error response using the
CONTENT-LENGTH  header  and  an  error  response  using  chuncked  encoding.    Values  in
italics are placeholders for actual values.

Note:  XML  namespace  prefixes  do  not  have  to  be  the  specific  examples  shown  below  (e.g.,

The argument value is invalid

An argument value is less than the minimum  or more than the
maximum value of the allowed value range, or is not in the allowed
value list.

The requested action is optional and is not implemented by the device.

The device does not have sufficient memory available to complete the
action. This is allowed to be a temporary condition; the control point
is allowed to choose to retry the unmodified request again later and it
is expected to succeed if memory is available.

Human Intervention
Required

The device has encountered an error condition which it cannot resolve
itself and required human intervention such as a reset or power cycle.

UPnP Error Schema

The UPnP Error Schema defines the structures and data types used in the body of UPnP error
messages. As with the UPnP Device and Service Schemas, the UPnP Error Schema is written
in  XML  syntax  and  according  to  the  conventions  of  XML  Schema  (Part  1:  Structures,  Part  2:
Datatypes). clause  B.4, “UPnP Error Schema” contains a listing of this schema. The elements
it defines are used in error messages.

For future extensibility and according to the requirements in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor
extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  when  processing  XML  like  the  listing
above,  devices  and  control  points  shall  ignore:  (a)  any  unknown  elements  and  their  sub
elements or content, and (b) any unknown attributes and their values.

Subject to the constraints defined in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor extensions” and clause
2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or
XML  processing  instructions  embedded  in UPnP  device  and service descriptions  that they do
not understand.

XML  namespace  prefixes  do  not  have  to  be  the  specific  examples  given  above  (e.g.,  “s”  or
“u”);  they  can  be  any  value  that  obeys  the  rules  of  the  general  XML  namespace  mechanism;
control points shall accept responses that use other legal XML namespace prefixes.

3.3  Query for variable

The  QueryStateVariable  action  has  been  deprecated  by  the  UPnP  Forum  and  shall  n ot  be
used  by  control  points  except  in  limited  testing  scenarios.  Working  committees  and  vendors
shall explicitly define actions for querying of state variables for which this capability is desired.
Such  explicit  query  actions  is  allowed  to  include  multiple  state  variables,  if  desired.  For  the
full definition of QueryStateVariable see the UPnP 1.0 specification.

4  Eventing

Eventing  is  Step  4  in  UPnP  networking.  Eventing  comes  after  addressing  (Step  0)  where
devices  get  a  network  address,  after  discovery  (Step  1)  where  control  points  find  interesting
device(s),  and  after  description  (Step  2)  where  control  points  learn  about  device  capabilities.
Eventing is intimately linked with control (Step 3) where control points send actions to devices.
Through eventing, control points listen to state changes in device(s). Control and eventing are
complementary to presentation (Step 5) where control points display a user interface provided
by device(s).

After a control  point  has  (1)  discovered  a  device  and (2) retrieved  a  description  of  the  device
and  its  services,  the  control  point  has  the  essentials  for  eventing.  As clause  2,  “Description”
explains,  a  UPnP  service  description  includes  a  list  of  actions  the  service  responds  to  and  a
list  of  variables  that  model  the  state  of  the  service  at  run  time.  If  one  or  more  of  these  state
variables  are  evented, then  the service  publishes  updates when  these variables change, and
a  control  point is  allowed  to  subscribe  to  receive  this  information.  Two  types  of  eventing  are
supported  by  this  specification:  unicast  eventing  as  found  in  version  1.0  of  the  UPnP
specification  where  a  control  point  is  allowed  to  subscribe  to  receive  variable  updates;  and
multicast  eventing  where  variables  is  allowed  to  be  defined  as  multicast  events  and  can  be
additionally  sent  over  UDP  to  any  listening  device on  the  multicast  event  address.  This  form
of eventing is useful when events which are not relevant to a specific UPnP interaction should
be  delivered  to  control  points  to  inform  users,  and  when  multiple  controlled  devices  want  to
inform  multiple  other  controlled  devices.  Throughout  this  clause,  publisher  refers  to  the
source  of  the  events  (typically  a  device's  service),  subscriber  refers  to  the  destination  of
events  (typically  a  control  point),  and  the  term  receiver  refers  to  the  listener  of  multicast
events (typically a control point, but is allowed to also be a controlled device).

To  subscribe  to  eventing,  a  subscriber  sends  a  subscription  message.  If  the  subscription  is
accepted,  the  publisher  responds  with  a  duration  for  the  subscription.  To  keep  the
subscription  active,  a  subscriber  shall  renew  its  subscription  before  the  subscription  expires.
When  a  subscriber  no  longer  needs  eventing  from  a  publisher,  the  subscriber should  cancel
its  subscription.  This  clause  explains  subscription,  renewal,  and  cancellation  messages  in
detail below.

The publisher notes changes to state variables by sending event messages. Event messages
contain  the  names  of  one  of  more  state  variables  and  the  current  value  of  those  variables,
expressed in XML. A special initial event message  is sent when a subscriber first subscribes;
this  event  message  contains  the  names  and  values  for  all  evented  variables  and  allows  the
subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service. To support scenarios with multiple
control  points,  eventing  can  be  used  to  keep  interested  control  points  informed  about  the
effects  of  actions  performed  by  other  control  points  or  using  other  mechanisms  for  device
control  (such  as  front  panel  controls).  All  subscribers  are  sent  all  event  messages,
subscribers  receive  event  messages  for  all  evented  variables  (not  just  some),  and  event
messages  are  sent  no  matter  why  the  state  variable  changed  (either  in  response  to  a
requested action or because the state the service is modeling changed). This clause explains
the format of event messages in detail below.

Some  state  variables  are  allowed  to change  value  too  rapidly  for  eventing   to  be  useful.  One
alternative  is  to  filter,  or  moderate,  the  number  of  event  messages  sent  due  to  changes  in  a
variable's value.  Some state variables  are  allowed to contain values  too  large  for  eventing to
be  useful;  for  this,  or  other  reasons,  a  service  is  allowed  to  designate  one  or  more  state
variables  as  non  evented  and  never  send  event  messages  to  subscribers.  To  determine  the
current  value  for  such  non-evented  variables,  control  points  shall  poll  the  service  explicitly,
presuming  that  an  action  is  provided  to  obtain  the  value  of  the  state  variable.  This  clause
explains how variable eventing is described within a service description.

To  send  and  receive  subscription  and  event  messages,  control  points  and  services  use  the
following subset of the overall UPnP protocol stack. (The overall UPnP protocol stack is listed
at the beginning of this document.)

At the highest layer, subscription and event messages contain vendor-specific information like

the  stack,  vendor  content  is  supplemented  by  information  from  a  UPnP  Forum  working
committee,  like  service  identifiers  or  variable  names.  Messages  from  the  layers  above  are
hosted in UPnP-specific protocols, defined in this document. In turn, the above messages are
delivered  via  HTTP  that  has  been  extended  using  additional  methods  and  header  fields.  The
HTTP  messages  are  delivered  via  TCP  over  IP.  For  reference,  colors  in  [square  brackets]
above  indicate  which  protocol  defines  specific  header  fields  in  the  subscription  messages

points that implement eventing.

Services  that  use  evented  complex  datatypes  shall  follow  the  requirements  in  clause  2.5,
“Service description”.

4.1.1

Subscription

A service has eventing if and only if one or more of the state variables are evented.

If  a  service  has  eventing,  it  publishes  event  messages  to  interested  subscribers.  The
publisher maintains a list of subscribers, keeping for each subscriber the following information.

unique subscription identifier

Required.  Shall  be  unique  over  the  lifetime  of  the  subscription,  however  long  or  short  that  may be.  Generated
by  publisher  in  response  to  subscription  message.  RECOMMEND  universally-unique  identifiers  to  ensure
uniqueness. Single URI.

delivery URL for event messages

Required. Provided by subscriber in subscription message. Single URL.

event key

Required.  Key  is  0  for  initial  event  message.  Key  shall  be  sequentially  numbered  for  each  subsequent  event
message;  subscribers  can  verify  that  no  event  messages  have  been  lost  if  the  subscriber  has  received
sequentially  numbered  event  keys.  Shall  wrap  from  4294967295  to  1  (32-bit  unsigned  decimal  integer).
Implementations are allowed to include leading “0” characters in the event key, which shall be ignored.

subscription duration

Required.  Amount  of  time,  or  duration  until  subscription  expires.  Single  integer,  preceded  in  subscription
messages by the keyword “Second- ” (no spaces). UPnP 1.0 defines the use of the keyword infinite instead of
an  integer.  This  keyword  is  deprecated  in  UPnP  2.0  (it  leads  to  problems  if  control  points  disappear  without
unsubscribing  and  is  hardly  used):  UPnP 2 .0  control  points shall  not  subscribe  using  keyword infinite,  UPnP
2.0  devices  shall  not  set  actual  subscription  durations  to  “infinite”.  The  presence  of infinite  in  a  request shall

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 90 —

be silently ignored by a  UPnP  2.0 device  (the presence  of infinite is handled  by the device  as if the TIMEOUT
header field in a request was not present) . The keyword infinite shall not be returned by a UPnP 2.0 device.

HTTP version supported by the subscriber

Required  if  the  publisher  supports  chunked  encoding  of  event  notification  messages,  so  that  chunked
messages are not sent to subscribers that do not support them.

A multi-homed publisher shall also maintain information on the UPnP-enabled interface on which each subscription message

was received. The same interface shall be used when publishing event messages to the corresponding subscriber.

The publisher should accept as many subscriptions as it can reasonably maintain, taking into
account  that  the  number  of  event  messages  that  need  to  be  delivered  per  event,  which
increases linearly with the number of subscriptions.

The  list  of  subscribers  is  updated  via  subscription,  renewal,  and  cancellation  messages
explained immediately below and event messages explained later in this clause.

To subscribe to eventing for a service, a subscriber sends a subscription message  containing
a  URL  for  the  publisher,  a  service  identifier  for  the  publisher,  and  a  delivery  URL  for  event
messages.  The  subscription  message  MAY  also  include  a  requested  duration  for  the
subscription.  The  URL  and  service  identifier  for  the  publisher  come  from  a  description
message.  As  clause  2,  “Description”  explains,  a  description  message  contains  a  device
description.  A device description contains (among other things), for each service, an eventing
URL  (obtained  from  the  eventSubURL  element)  and  a  service  identifier  (in  the  serviceId
element); these correspond to the URL and service identifier for the publisher, respectively. If
eventSubURL  is  an  absolute  URL,  the  fully  qualified  event  subscription  URL  is  the
eventSubURL. If eventSubURL is a relative URL, the fully qualified event subscription URL is
the  URL  resolved  from  eventSubURL  in  accordance  with clause  5  of  RFC  3986,  using  either
the  URLBase  element,  if  specified,  or  the  URL  from  which  the  device  description  was
retrieved  as  the  base  URL.  If  the  eventSubURL  is  empty,  no  subscriptions  are  possible.  The
fully qualified event subscription  URL for the  publisher shall  be  unique to  a  particular service
within  this  device.  A  multi-homed  control  point  that  sends  the  subscription  message  on  a
particular  UPnP-enabled  interface  shall  use  the  fully  qualified  eventing  URL  from  the
description  document  received  on  that  UPnP-enabled  interface.  The  delivery  URL  contained
in the subscription message shall be reachable on that interface.

The subscription request containing  a  delivery  URL not  on the same network segment  as  the
fully  qualified  event subscription URL  shall not  be accepted.  For private  networks this  means
that the delivery URL provided will adhere to the following IP ranges:

•  10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
•  172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
•  192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

The  subscription  message  is  a  request  to  receive  all  event  messages.  STATEVAR  is  a
recommended  mechanism  to  subscribe  to  event  messages  on  a  variable-by-variable  basis.
STATEVAR  allows  a  subscriber  to  avoid  being  sent  all  event  messages  from  the  service.
Using STATEVAR, or not, is to be considered when designing a service. Especially when you
are  using  a  large  number  of  variables,  STATEVAR  will  allow  you  to  eliminate  unnecessary
traffic.

If  the  subscription  is  accepted,  the  publisher  responds  with  a  unique  identifier  for  this
subscription  and  a  duration  for  this  subscription.  A  duration  should  be  chosen  that  matches
assumptions  about  how  frequently  control  points  are  removed  from  the  network;  if  control
points are removed every few minutes, then the duration should be similarly short, allowing a
publisher  to  rapidly  deprecate  any  expired  subscribers;  if  control  points  are  expected  to  be
semi-permanent, then the  duration should  be very long,  minimizing the  processing  and  traffic
associated with renewing subscriptions.

As  soon  as  possible  after  the  subscription  is  accepted,  the  publisher  also  sends  the  first,  or
initial  event message to the subscriber. This message includes the names and current values
for all evented variables. (The data type and range for each variable is described in a service

— 91 —

description. Clause  2, “Description” explains this in more detail.) This initial event message is
always  sent,  even  if  the  control  point  unsubscribes  before  it  is  delivered.  The  device  shall
insure  that  the  control  point  has  received  the  response  to  the  subscription  request  before
sending  the  initial  event  message,  to  insure  that  the  control  point  has  received  the  SID
(subscription ID) and can thereby correlate the event message to the subscription.

To  keep  the  subscription  active,  a  subscriber  shall  renew  its  subscription  before  the
subscription  expires  by  sending  a  renewal  message.  The  renewal  message  is  sent  to  the
same URL as the subscription message, but the renewal message does not include a delivery
URL  for  event  messages;  instead  the  renewal  message  includes  the  subscription  identifier.
The response for a renewal message is the same as one for a subscription message.

If  a  subscription  expires,  the  subscription  identifier  becomes  invalid,  and  the  publisher  stops
sending  event  messages  to  the  subscriber  and  can  clean  up  its  list  of  subscribers.  If  the
subscriber  tries  to  send  any  message  other  than  a  subscription  message,  the  publisher  shall
reject the message because the subscription identifier is invalid.

When  a  subscriber  no  longer  needs  eventing  from  a  particular  service,  the  subscriber  should
cancel its subscription. Canceling a subscription generally reduces service, control point, and
network  load.  If  a  subscriber  is  removed  abruptly  from  the  network,  it  might  be  impossible  to
send a cancellation message. As a fallback, the subscription will eventually expire on its own
unless renewed.

It  is  strongly recommended  that  subscribers monitor  discovery  messages  from  the  publisher.
If  the  publisher  cancels  its  advertisements  or  if  the  value  of  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  is
increased  without  a  prior  ssdp:update  message  with  a  matching  NEXTBOOTID.UPNP.ORG
field value, subscribers shall assume that their subscriptions have been cancelled.

Below  is  an  explanation  of  the  specific  format  of  requests,  responses,  and  errors  for
subscription, renewal, and cancellation messages.

4.1.2

SUBSCRIBE with NT and CALLBACK

For  each  service  in  a  device,  a  description  message  contains  an  event  subscription  URL
(obtained  from  the  eventSubURL  sub  element  of  service  element  in  the  device  description)
and  the  UPnP  service  identifier  (serviceId  sub  element  in  service  element  in  device
description). To subscribe to eventing for a particular service, a subscription message is sent
to  that  service's  fully  qualified  event  subscription  URL.  If  eventSubURL  is  an  absolute  URL,
the  fully  qualified  event  subscription  URL  is  the  eventSubURL.  Otherwise,  if  eventSubURL  is
a  relative  URL,  the  fully  qualified  event  subscription  URL  is  the  URL  resolved  from
eventSubURL in accordance with clause 5 of RFC 3986, using either the URLBase element, if
specified,  or  the  URL  from  which  the  device  description  was  retrieved  as  the  base  URL.  The
message  contains  that  service's  identifier  as  well  as  a  delivery  URL  for  event  messages.  A
multi-homed control  point that sends  the subscription  message on  a  particular UPnP-enabled
interface shall use the fully qualified eventing URL from the description document received on
that interface. The delivery URL contained in the subscription message shall be reachable on
that interface. A subscription message MAY also include a requested subscription duration.

To  subscribe  to  eventing  for  a  service,  a  subscriber  shall  send  a  request  with  method
SUBSCRIBE  and  NT  and  CALLBACK  header  fields  in  the  following  format.  Values  in  italics
are placeholders for actual values.

generated by the subscription will contain all implemented evented state variables in the service.

If  there  are enough resources to  maintain the subscription, the publisher  should accept it. To
accept a subscription request, a publisher shall send a response in the following format within
30 seconds, including expected transmission time. This shall be sent to the same endpoint as
that  over  which  the  subscription  request  was  sent.  After  accepting  the  subscription,  the
publisher  assigns  a  unique  identifier  for  the  subscription,  assigns  a  duration  for  the
subscription,  and  sends  an  initial  event  message  (explained  in  detail  later  in  this  clause).  A
multi-homed publisher shall send the response on the same UPnP-enabled interface on which
the subscription message was received. Values in italics are placeholders for actual values.

CONTENT-LENGTH

Required  if TCP FIN flag cannot be guaranteed to be sent before the initial event is sent. shall  have field value
“0”.

ACCEPTED-STATEVAR

Required  if  the  SUBSCRIPTION  contains  the  STATEVAR  header  containing  a  valid  CSV  of  implemented
evented  state  variables.  The  implementation  then  shall  only  send  events  for  the  state  variables  listed  in  the
STATEVAR  list.  When  one  of  the  listed  state  variables  in  the  STATEVAR  CSV  list  is  not  implemented,  the
ACCEPTED_STATEVAR header shall not be sent  back. This means that the subscription is valid  and  all state
variables designated to be evented shall be evented.

If  a  publisher  cannot  accept  the  subscription,  or  if  there  is  an  error  with  the  subscription
request,  the  publisher shall  send  a  response  with  one  of  the  following  errors.  The  response
shall be sent within 30 seconds, including expected transmission time.

Other  errors,  including  other  HTTP  status  codes,  MAY  be  returned  by  layers  in  the  protocol
stack below the UPnP protocols. Consult documentation on those protocols for details.

4.1.3

Renewing a subscription with SUBSCRIBE with SID

To renew a subscription to eventing for a particular service, a renewal message is sent to that
service's  fully  qualified  event subscription  URL  (See clause   4.1.2,  “SUBSCRIBE  with  NT  and
CALLBACK”).  However,  unlike  an  initial  subscription  message,  a  renewal  message  does  not
contain  either  the  service's  identifier  nor  a  delivery  URL  for  event  messages.  Instead,  the
message  contains  the  subscription  identifier  assigned  by  the  publisher,  providing  an
unambiguous  reference  to  the  subscription  to  be  renewed.  Like  a  subscription  message,  a
renewal  message  MAY also include  a requested  subscription duration.  A  multi-homed control
point  shall  send  the  renewal  message  using  the  same  pair  of  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  used
for the initial subscription.

The  renewal  message  uses  the  same  method  as  the  subscription  message,  but  the  two
messages use a disjoint set of header fields; renewal uses SID and subscription uses NT and

multi-homed control  point shall send  the cancellation  message using  the same  pair  of  UPnP-
enabled  interfaces  used  for  the  initial  subscription.  Canceling  a  subscription  generally
reduces  service,  control  point,  and  network  load.  If  a  control  point  is  removed  abruptly  from
the  network,  it  might  be  impossible  to  send  a  cancellation  message.  As  a  fallback,  the
subscription will eventually expire on its own unless renewed.

To explicitly cancel a subscription to eventing for a service, a subscriber shall send a request

The  publisher  MAY  note  changes  to  state  variables  by  sending  multicast  event  messages.
Multicast  event  messages  contain  the  names  of  one  or  more  state  variables  and  the  current
value  of  those  variables,  expressed  in  XML.  To  send  and  receive  multicast  event  messages,
control  points  and services use the  following subset  of the overall  UPnP  protocol stack.  (The
overall UPnP protocol stack is listed at the beginning of this document.)

At  the  highest  layer,  multicast  event  messages  contain  vendor-specific  information  like
vendor-specific  state  variable  or  specific  variable  values.  Moving  down  the  stack,  vendor
content  is  supplemented  by  information  from  a  UPnP  Forum  working  committee,  such  as
service  identifiers  or  variable  names.  Messages  from  the  layers  above  are  hosted  in  UPnP-
specific  protocols  to  transport  events  in  a  similar  format  to  unicast  UPnP  events,  but  over  a
multicast  address  where  subscriptionless  eventing  fits  the  desired  usage.  These  messages
are  based  on  the  HTTP  protocol  header  and  body  format,  but  are  not  HTTP  compliant

because they are defined over UDP sockets. Throughout this clause, the same formatting and
extension  rules  for  SSDP  as  set  forth  in  clause  1.1.2,  “SSDP  message  header  fields”  and
clause  1.1.3,  “SSDP  header  field  extensions”  are  used  to  give  HTTP-like  header  field
formatting.  In  addition,  services  that  use  evented  complex  datatypes  shall  follow  the
requirements  in  clause  2.5,  “Service  description”.  Lastly,  like  SSDP,  to  limit  network
congestion,  the  time-to-live  (TTL)  of  each  IP  packet  for  each  multicast  message  should
default to 2 and should  be configurable. This should be the same value as that used in SSDP.
When  the  TTL  is  greater  than  1,  it  is  possible  for  multicast  messages  to  traverse  multiple
routers; therefore control points and devices using non-AutoIP addresses shall send an IGMP
Join  message  so  that  routers  will  forward  multicast  messages  to  them  (this  is  not  necessary
when using an Auto-IP address since packets with Auto-IP addresses will not be forwarded by
routers).

Multicast eventing is inherently unreliable since it is based on UDP. In addition, there will be a
greater  possibility  of  message  loss  with  greater  packet  size.  To  increase  the  probability  of
successful  transmission,  each  message  MAY  be  retransmitted  one  or  more  times.  Therefore,
UPnP  working committees shall specify  the  event  size and  event retransmission  rules,  based
on their need for reliability.

4.3

Event messages

A  service  publishes  changes  to  certain  state  variables  by  sending  event  messages.  These
messages  contain  the  names  of  one  or  more  state  variables  and  the  current  value  of  those
variables. Event messages shall be sent in a timely manner so that subscribers are accurately
informed  about  the  state  of  the  service  and  can  provide  a  responsive  user  interface.    If  the
value  of  more  than  one  variable  is  changing  at  the  same  time,  the  publisher  should  bundle
these changes into a single event message to reduce processing and netw ork traffic.

As  explained  above,  an  initial  event  message  is  sent  when  a  subscriber  first  subscribes;  this
event  message  contains  the  names  and  values  for  all  evented  variables  or  individual
requested variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service.
This message should be sent as soon  as  possible after the publisher  accepts a subscription.
This  message  shall  be  sent,  even  if  the  control  point  unsubscribes  before  the  message  is
delivered. Subscription does not cause multicast event messages.

Multicast event messages are constrained to being transported in a single UDP payload. This
consideration is important when identifying variables that are to be multicast. If the cumulative
size  of  the  variables  that  are  eligible  for  being  sent  by  multicast  exceeds  the  UDP  packet’s
capacity, it may be necessary to send multiple, distinct multicast events.

Both unicast and multicast event messages are tagged with an event key. In unicast eventing,
a  separate  event  key  shall  be  maintained  by  the  publisher  for  each  subscription  to  facilitate
error  detection (as  explained below).  The  event key  for  a subscription  is  initialized  to  0  when
the  publisher  sends  the  initial  event  message.  For  each  subsequent  event  message,  the
publisher increments (by one) the event key for a subscription, and includes that updated key
in  the  event  message.  The  event  key  for  multicast  events  is  also  initialized  to  0  when  the
publisher sends the initial event message. For each subsequent multicast event message, the
publisher  increments  (by  one)  the  event  key  for  the  multicast  events,  and  includes  that
updated  key  in  the  event  message.  Any  implementation  of  event  keys  shall  handle  overflow
and wrap the event key from 4294967295 back to 1 (not 0). Unicast subscribers and multicast
receivers  shall  also  handle  this  special  case  when  the  next  event  key  is  not  an  increment  of
the previous key. The key shall be implemented as a 4 Byte (32 bit) unsigned integer.

All UPnP event messages shall be encoded using UTF-8.

4.3.1

Error Cases

For  unicast  eventing,  the  publisher shall  send  all  event  messages  to  the  subscriber  until  the
subscription  expires  even  when  the  subscriber  fails  to  respond.  When  a  subscriber  has
missed  one  or  more  event  messages,  the  subscriber  MAY  synchronize  with  the  device’s

evented state by unsubscribing and re-subscribing. By doing so, the subscriber will get a new
subscription identifier, a new initial event message, and a new event key.

For multicast eventing, since UDP is inherently unreliable, retransmission of a multicast event
message  (using  the  same  SEQ  field  value)  can  increase  the  reliability.  The  receiver  shall
interpret  the  same  SEQ  field  value  from  separate  multicast  event  messages  from  a  same
service  (identified  by  USN  field  value)  as  being  the  exactly  the  same  message  sent  multiple
times and shall therefore ignore such duplicates. Some state variables may change value too
rapidly  for  some  environments,  for  example  enterprises.  Working  committees  shall  specify
traffic  constraints  for  the  DCP  given  these  concerns  and  guidelines.  Working  committees
should  consider  both  the  interval  for  transmission  of  multicast  events  per  event  type  (LVL:)
and the retransmission rules for particular event instances.

4.3.2

Unicast eventing: Event messages: NOTIFY

To  send  an event  message,  a  publisher  shall  send  a  request  with  method  NOTIFY using  the
following  format.    The  following  two  examples  illustrate  an  event  message  using  the
CONTENT-LENGTH header and an event message using chunked encoding. Values in italics
are placeholders for actual values.

Event  messages  sent  to  different  subscribers  that  have  the  same  sequence  number  shall
contain the same content except for the HOST header field. A multi-homed device shall send
the  event  message  using  the  same  pair  of  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  used  for  the  initial
subscription.

Note:  XML  namespace  prefixes  do  not  have  to  be  the  specific  examples  shown  below  (e.g.,
“s”  or  “u”);  they  can  be  any  value  that  obeys  the  rules  of  the  general  XML  namespace
mechanism; control points shall accept event messages that use other legal XML namespace
prefixes.

in  service  description).  Shall  not  be  qualified  with  any
namespace. Value is the new value for this state variable. Case sensitive. Single data type as
specified by UPnP service description.

For future extensibility and according to the requirements in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor
extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  when  processing  XML  like  the  listing
above,  devices  and  control  points  shall  ignore:  (a)  any  unknown  elements  and  their  sub
elements  or  content,  and  (b)  any  unknown  attributes  and  their  values.  Note  that  when
subscribing to eventing with a service that is of a higher version than what is supported by the
control  point,  event  notifications  MAY  be  sent  by  the  service  to  the  control  point  containing
state  variable  names  that  are  not  recognized  by  the  control  point.  The  control  point  should
discard and ignore such unrecognized state variables within event notification messages.

When  the  new  value  of  any  variable  contains  one  or  more  characters  reserved  as  markup
(such as ampersand (“&”) or less than (“<”)), the text shall be escaped in accordance with the
provisions  of clause  2.4  of  the  XML  specification  and  each  such  character  replaced  with  the
equivalent  numeric  representation  or  string  (such  as  “&amp;”  or  “&lt;”).  Such  characters
appearing  in  URLs  that  appear  as  values  MAY  also  be  percent-encoded  in  accordance  with
the URL percent-encoding rules specified in clauses 2.1 and 2.4 of RFC 3986.

On  a  multi-homed  device,  all  fully-qualified  URLs  contained  in  event  body  that  refer  to
resources on the device shall be reachable on the UPnP-enabled interface on which the event
message is sent.

Subject to the constraints defined in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor extensions” and clause
2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or
XML processing instructions embedded in UPnP event messages that they do not understand.
Note  that  because  HTTP  1.1  allows  use  of  chunked  encoding,  some  devices  MAY  send  the
event notification using chunked encoding if the SUBSCRIBE request specified HTTP 1.1. It is

therefore  recommended  that  all  implementations  that  include  HTTP  1.1  in  the  SUBSCRIBE
request support receiving chunked encoding.

To acknowledge receipt of this event message, a subscriber shall respond within 30 seconds,
including  expected  transmission  time.  A  multi-homed  subscriber  shall  send  the  response
using  the  same  pair  of  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  used  for  the  event  message.  If  a  subscriber
does  not  respond  within  30  seconds,  or  if  the  publisher  is  unable  to  connect  to  the
subscription  URL,  the  publisher should  abandon  sending  this  message  to  the  subscriber  but
shall keep the subscription active and send future event messages to the subscriber until the
subscription  expires  or  is  cancelled.  The  subscriber  shall  send  a  response  in  the  following
format.

4.3.3  Multicast Eventing: Event messages: NOTIFY

To  send  a  multicast  event  message,  a  publisher shall  send  a  message  with  method  NOTIFY
using  the  following  format.    The  following  example  illustrates  an  event  message  using  the
CONTENT-LENGTH header.  Values in italics are placeholders for actual values.

A  multi-homed  publisher  shall  multicast  the  event  message  on  each  of  its  UPnP-enabled
interfaces.  Event  messages  sent  on  different  UPnP-enabled  interfaces  that  have  the  same
sequence  number shall  contain  the  same  content  except  for  possibly  the  HOST  header  field
and  any  fully-qualified  URLs  contained  in  the  event  body.  The  HOST  header  field  of  an
advertisement  shall  be  the  standard  multicast  eventing  address  specified  for  the  protocol
(IPv4  or IPv6)  used  on the  interface.  All  fully-qualified  URLs contained in  the  event  body  that

refer  to  resources  on  the  device shall  be  reachable  on  the  UPnP-enabled  interface  on  which
the event message is sent.

Note: XML namespace prefixes do not have to be the specific example shown below (e.g., “s”
or “u”); they can be any value that obeys the rules of the general XML namespace mechanism;
control points shall accept event messages that use other legal XML namespace prefixes.

Description

upnp:/emergency

upnp:/fault

upnp:/warning

upnp:/info

upnp:/debug

upnp:/general

<domain>:/<level>

The event carries critical information that the
device should act upon immediately.

The event carries information related to an
error case

The event carries information that is a non-
critical condition that the device MAY want to
process or pass to the user

The event carries information about the normal
operation of the device that  may be of interest
to end-users.  This information is sim ply
informative and does not indicate any abnormal
condition or status such as a warning or fault.
Other event levels are defined for th ose
purposes.

The event carries debug information typically
used by programmers and test engineers to
evaluate the internal operation of the device.
This information is typically not displayed to
end users.

For events that fit into no other defined
category

Example vendor extension. Domain is the ICANN
domain name for the vendor and level is an
arbitrary string defined by the ve ndor. E.g.
domain.org:/alerts/type/

Body

<propertyset>

Required. xmlns namespace shall be “urn:schemas-upnp-org:event- 1-0”. Contains the following sub element:

<property>

Required.  Repeat  once for  each variable name and value  in the event message. Shall  be  qualified by
the  namespace  prefix  defined  in  the  xmlns  attribute  of  the  <propertyset>  element.  Contains  the
following sub element:

<variableName>

Required.  Element  is  name  of  a  state  variable  that  changed  (name  sub  element  of
stateVariable  element  in  service  description).  Shall  not  be  qualified  with  any  namespace.
Value is the new value for this state variable. Case sensitive. Single data type as specified by
UPnP service description.

Note  that  for  simplicity  many  of  the  header  fields  for  multicast  eventing  are  the  same  as  for
unicast  eventing.  These  include:  HOST,  CONTENT-TYPE,  USN,  NT,  NTS,  and  SEQ.  In
addition, the body of the message (propertyset) has the same format as unicast events.

For future extensibility and according to the requirements in clause 2.7, “Non-standard vendor
extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP  Device  Schema”,  when  processing  XML  like  the  listing
above,  devices  and  control  points  shall  ignore:  (a)  any  unknown  elements  and  their  sub
elements  or  content,  and  (b)  any  unknown  attributes  and  their  values.  Subject  to  the
constraints  defined  in  clause  2.7,  “Non-standard  vendor  extensions”  and  clause  2.8,  “UPnP
Device  Schema”,  control  points  and  devices  shall  ignore  any  XML  comments  or  XML
processing  instructions  embedded  in  UPnP  device  and  service  descriptions  that  they  do  not
understand.  The  control  point  should  discard  and  ignore  unrecognized  state  variables  within
multicast event notification messages.

When  the  new  value  of  any  variable  contains  one  or  more  characters  reserved  as  markup
(such as ampersand (“&”) or less than (“<”)), the text shall be escaped in accordance with the
provisions  of clause  2.4  of  the  XML  specification  and  each  such  character  replaced  with  the
equivalent  numeric  representation  or  string  (such  as  “&amp;”  or  “&lt;”).  Such  characters
appearing  in  URLs  that  appear  as  values  MAY  also  be  percent-encoded  in  accordance  with
the URL percent-encoding rules specified in clauses 2.1 and 2.4 of RFC 3986.

4.4  UPnP Event Schema

The  UPnP  Event  Schema  defines  the  structures  and  data  types  used  in  the  body  of  UPnP
event  notifications.  As  explained  with  the  UPnP  Device  and  Service  Schemas,  the  UPnP
Event Schema is written in XML syntax according to the conventions of XML Schema (Part 1:
Structures,  Part  2:  Datatypes).  The  UPnP  Event  Schema  is  defined  within  a  UPnP  service
template;  however,  the  schema shall  conform  to  the  format  as  defined  in  clause  B.5,  “UPnP
Event Schema”. The elements it defines are used in event notifications.

As  explained  in  clause  2,  “Description”,  the  UPnP  Service  Schema  also  specifies  a
sendEvents  attribute  for  a  state  variable.  The  default  value  for  this  attribute  is  “yes”.  To
denote  that  a  state  variable  is  evented,  the  value  of  this  attribute  is  “yes”  (or  the  attribute  is
omitted)  in  a  service  description;  to  denote  that  a  state variable  is  non-evented,  the  value  is
“no”. Note  that if  all of  a  service's state variables  are non-evented,  the service has  nothing  to
publish,  and  control  points  cannot  subscribe  and  will  not  receive  event  messages  from  the
service.

4.5  Augmenting the UPnP Device and Service Schemas

Some  state  variables  may  change  value  too  rapidly  for  eventing  to  be  useful.  UPnP  Forum
Working  Committees  or  UPnP  vendors  may  document  moderation  in  the  number  of  event
messages sent due to changes in a variable’s value.  Event moderation may include limitation
on the frequency in reporting change of a state variable value or a minimum degree of change
that shall occur before a change is reported.

Parameter

maximumRate

minimumDelta

— 107 —

Description

Single numeric value (in seconds) of type integer or float. State variable v shall not be part
of an event message more often than every n seconds. If v is the only state variable
changing, then an event message containing the state variable shall not be generated
more often than every n seconds. If v has changed sooner than n seconds from the last
event message that contains v, then an event message containing the current value of v
shall be sent in a timely manner  after n seconds from the previous event message
containing v. If v has not changed within n seconds following the last event message that
contains v, then when v does change an event message with the current value of v shall be
sent in a timely manner. Specifying a maximumRate value is useful for variables that
model frequently changing state variables.

Single numeric value (minimum change required) whose type shall match the
corresponding state variable. State variable v shall not be part of an event message unless
its value has changed (plus or minus) by at least minimumDelta since the last time an
event message was sent that contains v.  Only valid for state variables with a numeric
(integer or float) data type. Specifying a minimumDelta value is useful for variables that
model continuously changing state variables.

The  publisher  MAY  send  out  any  changed  moderated  variable  when  an  event  goes  out.  The
publisher  shall  meet  moderation  rules  described  above,  but  the  publisher  MAY  flush  recent
changes when it sends out an event message.

Note  that  moderation  affects  events  only  and  not  state  table  updates.  Specifically,  control
actions  which  return  the  value  of  state  variables  MAY  return  a  more  current  value  than
published  via  eventing.  Put  another  way,  moderation  means  that  not  all  state  table  changes
result in events.

Decisions  about  which  variables  to  event  and  any  possible  moderation  is  up  to  the
appropriate  UPnP  Forum  working  committee  (for  standard  services)  or  a  UPnP  vendor  (for
non-standard services).

5  Presentation

Presentation  is  Step  5  in  UPnP  networking.  Presentation  comes  after  addressing  (Step  0)
where  devices  get  network  addresses,  after  discovery  (Step  1)  where  control  points  find
interesting  device(s),  and  after  description  (Step  2)  where  control  points  learn  about  device
capabilities.  Presentation  exposes  an  HTML-based  user  interface  for  controlling  and/or
viewing device  status. Presentation is complementary to control (Step 3) where control points
send actions to devices, and eventing (Step 4) where control points listen to state changes in
device(s).

After a control point has (1) discovered a device and (2) retrieved a description of the device,
the  control  point  is  ready  to  begin  presentation.  If  a  device  has  a  URL  for  presentation,  then
the  control  point  can  retrieve  a  page  from  this  URL,  load  the  page  into  a  browser  and,
depending  on  the  capabilities  of  the  page,  allow  a  user  to  control  the  device  and/or  view
device  status.  The  degree  to  which  each  of  these  can  be  accomplished  depends  on  the
specific capabilities of the presentation page and device.

The  URL  for  presentation  is  obtained  from  the  presentationURL  element  in  the  device
description. If presentationURL is an absolute URL, the fully qualified presentation URL is the
presentationURL.  Otherwise,  if  presentationURL  is  a  relative  URL,  the  fully  qualified
presentation  URL  is  the  URL  resolved  from presentationURL  in  accordance  with clause  5  of
RFC 3986, using either the URLBase element, if specified, or the URL from which the device
description  was  retrieved  as  the  base  URL.  A  multi-homed  control  point  that  attempts  to
retrieve  a  presentation  page  on  a  particular  UPnP-enabled  interface  shall  use  the  fully
qualified  presentation  URL  from  the  description  document  received  on  that  interface.  The
device description is delivered via a description message. Clause 2, “Description” explains the
device description and description messages in detail.

Retrieving  a  presentation  page  is  a  simple  HTTP-based  process  and  uses  the  following
subset  of  the  overall  UPnP  protocol  stack.  (The  overall  UPnP  protocol  stack  is  listed  at  the
beginning of this document.)

At  the  highest  layer,  the  presentation  page  is  specified  by  a  UPnP  vendor.  Moving  down  the
stack, the UPnP Device Architecture specifies that this page be written in HTML. The page is
delivered via HTTP over TCP over IP. For reference, colors in [square brackets] are included
for consistency with other clauses in this document.

To  retrieve  a  presentation  page,  the  control  point  issues  an  HTTP  GET  request  to  the
presentation  URL,  and  the  device  returns  a  presentation  page.  Responses  to  HTTP  GET
requests  for  presentation  pages shall  be  sent  using  the  same  address  on  the  same  interface
on which the HTTP GET was received. The generic requirements on HTTP usage in UPnP 2.0
(as  defined  in  clause  2.1,  “Generic  requirements  on  HTTP  usage”  of  this  document) shall   be
followed by devices and control points that implement presentation.

Unlike  the  UPnP  Device  and  Service  Templates,  and  standard  device  and  service  types,  the
capabilities of the presentation page are completely specified by the UPnP vendor. The page
shall  be  an  HTML  page;  it  is  recommended  that  the  page  be  based  upon  XHTML- Basic.
However,  other  design  aspects  are  left  to  the  vendor  to  specify.  This  includes,  but  is  not
limited to, all capabilities of the control point's browser, scripting language or browser plug-ins

used,  and  means  of  interacting  with  the  device.  To  implement  a  presentation  page,  a  UPnP
vendor  MAY  wish  to  use  UPnP  mechanisms  for  control  and/or  eventing,  leveraging  the
device's existing capabilities but is not constrained to do so.

Presentation  pages  should  use  mechanisms  provided  by  HTML  for  localization  (e.g.,  META
tag  with  charset  attribute).  Control  points  should  use
the  ACCEPT-LANGUAGE  and
CONTENT-LANGUAGE  feature  of  HTTP  to  try  to  retrieve  a  localized  presentation  page.
Specifically,  a  control  point  MAY  include  a  HTTP  ACCEPT-LANGUAGE  header  field  in  the
request  for  a  presentation  page;  if  an  ACCEPT-LANGUAGE  header  field  is  present  in  the
request,  the  response  shall  include  a  CONTENT-LANGUAGE  header  field  to  identify  the
page's language.

It  is recommended  that  fully  qualified  URLs  to  resources  on  the  device  are  not  embedded  in
HTML presentation pages, but that relative URLs are used instead, so that the host portion of
the  embedded  URLs  does  not  need  to  be  modified  when  sent  on  different  UPnP-enabled
interfaces.

Annex A
(normative)
IP Version 6 Support

A.0  Note (informative)

2014 IPv6 Support Update: This revision to the UPnP Device Architecture Annex A is motivated by a need to allow
UPnP services and implementations to determine address selection preferences, and not require they abide by the
default  RFC  6724  preference  scheme.  RFC  6724  (which  obsoleted  RFC  3484)  expressed  IPv6  preference  as  a
default  behavior,  but  explicitly  recognized  that  applications  may  have  good  reason  to  use  other  preference
schemes, and described several possible other preference schemes.

2012  IPv6  Support  Update:  This  revision  to  the  UPnP  Device  Architecture  Annex  A  is  motivated  by  operational
experience gained since the previous update. There are four high level goals addressed with these latest changes:

1. IPv6 support needs to be required in order for new and existing devices to interoperate with each other

2. GUA  and  ULA  should  be  treated  with  equal  weight,  with  address  selection  performed  according  to  IETF

guidance

3. IPv6 needs to be preferred over IPv4 whenever it is available, per IETF guidance

4. The IPv6 updates need to be applicable to UDA 1.0, UDA 1.1 and UDA 2.0 implementations

UPnP  devices  and  control  points  need  to  be  encouraged  to  support  IPv6.  The  IPv4  public  address  space  is
effectively  exhausted,  and  the  move  towards  IPv6  is  considered  inevitable.  Service  providers  and  on-line  content
providers  are  all  adding  support  of  IPv6.  Consumer  electronics  devices  that  are  capable  of  accessing  on-line
services and content will also need to move to IPv6. In fact, the IETF has signaled its opinion on the deployment of
IPv6  in  RFC  6540,  titled  “IPv6  Support  Required  for  all  IP-capable  Nodes.”  Also,  as  IPv6  standards  and  support
progress,  there  may  be  additional  benefit  to  having  UPnP  supported  over  IPv6.  There  are  potential  advantages  to
the  Remote  Access  architecture,  as  well  as  possible  future  benefits  for  traversal  of  multiple  routers  inside  a  home
network.  IPv6  support  is  being  encouraged  by  CEA  through  the  efforts  of  a  new  CEA  Working  Group  focused  on
IPv6  and  the  transition  from  IPv4.  UPnP  needs  to  stay  relevant  in  the  evolving  IP  world,  which  demands  that  IPv6
interoperability be enabled. Legacy UDA 1.0 certified devices are allowed to remain non-IPv6 compliant, however it
is highly recommended that all UPnP devices and control points support IPv6 and dual-stack operation.

While it may be preferable to use ULA for communication within the home network, preferring ULA over GUA under
all  conditions  would  result  in  breaking  external  connectivity.  This  revision  of  Annex  A  defines  ULA  and  GUA  as
having equal weight. It describes a “use both” approach to discovery and advertisement where devices and control
points  perform  initial  communication  on  all  enabled  IP  addresses  (IPv4  and  IPv6  alike).  For  other  communication,
there are standard mechanisms for making address selection that do not require a default overriding preference for
one  or the other addressing schemes. These methods are documented in IETF RFC 3484, which is currently being
updated.  UPnP  devices  that  follow  the  most  up-to-date  standard  for  address  selection  will  have  the  highest
guarantee of interoperability. Note that IETF RFC 3484 also requires devices to prefer IPv6 over IPv4. There are a
variety  of  reasons  why  the  IETF  has  taken  this  approach,  and  these  reasons  apply  to  UPnP  devices  and
applications just as well as other devices and applications. It is also desirable for UPnP devices and applications to
use address selection mechanisms that are consistent with those used by other applications and devices.

A.1

Introduction

Most  of  today's  Internet  uses  IPv4,  which  was  first  standardized  in  1981.  IPv4  has  been
remarkably resilient in spite of its age, but it is beginning to have problems. Most importantly,
there is a growing shortage  of IPv4 addresses, which are needed by all new machines added
to  the  Internet.  Deployment  of  large  numbers  of  UPnP  devices  will  only  exacerbate  the
shortage.

IPv6  overcomes  many  shortcomings  of  the  IPv4  protocol,  such  as  the  comparatively  limited
number of available addresses and provides other significant optimizations. It also adds many
improvements  to  IPv4  in  areas  such  as  routing  and  network  automatic  configuration.  IPv6  is
expected  to  gradually  replace  IPv4,  with  the  two  coexisting  for  a  number  of  years,  if  not
decades, during a transition period.

This  Annex  describes  mechanisms  that  will  allow  devices  and  control  points  based  on  the
UPnP Device Architecture to be used on IPv6 networks.

A.2  General Principles

A.2.1

UPnP Device Architecture V1.0

UDA  1.0  devices and  control  points  SHALL  implement  IPv4  and  support  IPv4-only  operation,
and  SHOULD  implement  IPv6  and  support  dual  stack  (IPv4  and  IPv6)  operation.     Vendors
MAY  choose  to  allow  IPv6-only  operation  as  a  policy  alternative,  but  a  device  and  a  control
point SHALL run IPv4 in order to be certified.

A.2.2

UPnP Device Architecture V2.0

UDA  2.0  devices  and  control  points  SHALL  implement  IPv4  and  IPv6,  SHALL  support  dual
stack  (IPv4  and  IPv6)  operation,  and  SHALL  be  capable  of  operating  on  IPv4-only  and  IPv6-
only  networks. Vendors  MAY  choose  to  allow  IPv4-only  and/or  IPv6-only  operation  as
configuration  alternatives,  but  a  device  and  a  control  point  SHALL  run  dual-stack  in  order  to
be certified.

A.2.3

IPv6 and Dual Stack

Devices  operating  in  dual-stack  mode  SHALL  perform  discovery  and  advertisement  on  all
available  non-temporary  (RFC  4941)  Globally  Unique  Addresses  (GUA),  Unique  Local
Addresses  (ULA),  Link-Local  Addresses,  and  IPv4  addresses.  This  list  excludes  temporary
addresses,  deprecated  address  space,  and  addresses  associated  with  various  IPv4  to  IPv6
transition  technologies  (e.g.,  6to4,  Teredo,  ISATAP).  While  not  expressly  forbidden,  these
addresses  SHOULD  NOT  be  used  for  discovery  and  advertisement.  IETF  RFC  6724
recommends  default source and destination  address-selection behavior but specifically  notes
that  its  selection  rules  are  not  to  be  construed  to  override  an  application  or  upper  layer's
explicit  choice  of  a  legal  destination  or  source  address.  UPnP  control  points  and  devices
SHOULD  use  RFC  6724  default  destination  address  selection  algorithms  in  the  absence  of
more specific guidance. However, it is allowed for more specific guidance to exist, and UPnP
implementers  are  encouraged  to  identify  if  such  guidance  is  needed  to  meet  their  particular
use cases. For any selected destination address, control points and devices SHALL use RFC
6724 source address selection algorithms.

All IPv6 devices and control points that implement both stacks are inherently multi-homed.  An
IPv6 device or control point MAY also have multiple IPv6 addresses from both ULA and GUA
address scopes. The  basic principle is  that  the unicast addresses  advertised  by  a  device  are
consistent  with  the  scope  used  for  that  multicast  advertisement  message.  The  rules  for
associating  an  IPv6  address  with  a  particular  multicast  scope  are  defined  based  on  the
degree  of  ”routeability”  provided  by  a  particular  IPv6  address.  The  two  multicast  scopes
currently defined for use in UPnP are:

•

Link-Local  Scope  (the  stations  reachable  without  routing)  which  uses  addresses  called  Link-Local
Addresses.

•  Site-Local  Scope  (a  private  network  consisting  of  one  or  more  links  bounded  by  a  site’s  administrative
edge)  which  uses  Unique  Local  Addresses  (ULA)  or  Globally  Unique  Addresses  (GUA).  This  scope  is
inclusive of the Link-Local Scope.

See RFC 4291 Section 2.7 for multicast scope definitions.

The  Internet  Assigned  Numbers  Authority  has  registered  a  multicast  address  and  port  for
SSDP: an address is of the form FF0X::C. This is a variable scope multicast address where X
is  changed  to  represent  the  appropriate  scope.  A  device  advertising  on  the  local  link  would
use  a  scope  of  2  and  address  [FF02::C]:1900.  A  site-scope  advertisement  on  the  home
network would use scope 5 [see 2.7 of RFC 4291] and specify address [FF05::C]:1900. Table
A-1 shows the multicast scope to use with a particular source address.

Since a UPnP device uses multicast for advertisements, and multicast eventing, and there is a
corresponding  scope  defined  for  multicast,  the  rules  set  forth  below  define  the  selection  of
unicast  addresses  in  the  context  of  the  multicast  scope  used  for  multicast  messages.  In
addition,  a  UPnP  device  SHALL  adhere  to  all  multi-homed  behaviors  described  in  this
document.

The  following  requirements  apply  to  devices  and  control  points  using  the  UPnP  Device
Architecture  over  IPv6.  This  is  an  overview  of  the  process.  Implementers  SHALL  refer  to  the
cited references for details and conform to requirements included within those citations.

a)  Devices  and  control  points  SHALL  use  only  the  Link-Local  unicast  address  as  the  source
address  and  when  specifying  a  literal  IP  address  in  LOCATION  URLs  in  all  multicast
messages that are multicast to the Link-Local scope FF02::C for SSDP and FF02::130 for
multicast  eventing.   Devices  and  control  points  SHALL
the  Link-Local
scope.  See RFC 4862 for details of Link-Local addressing.

listen  on

e)  Devices and control points SHALL implement SLAAC (RFC 4862) for address assignment
on  each  IPv6-enabled  interface.  They  MAY  implement  DHCPv6  with  the  IA-NA  option
(RFC  3315)  for  address  assignment.  Once  the  address  assignment  process  is  complete,
the  device  or  control  point  will  have  exactly  one  link  local  address  available  (unless
Duplicate  Address  Detection  failed)  and  zero,  one,  or  more  ULA  and/or  GUA  addresses
available for use, on an IPv6-enabled interface.

f)  Devices and control points SHALL use an acquired ULA or GUA in all multicast messages
as  the  source  address  and  when  specifying  a  literal  IP  address  in  LOCATION  URLs  that
are multicast to the Site-Local scope addresses of either FF05::C or FF05::130.

g)  Devices  and  control  points  SHALL  NOT  send  Global  scoped,  Organization-Local  scoped,

or Admin-Local scoped multicast messages.

h)  A  device  SHALL  listen  for  unicast  SSDP  traffic  on  all  multicast  scopes  on  which  it  has
advertised,  for  each  UPnP-enabled  interface.  Control  points  SHALL  listen  for  unicast
SSDP traffic in order to identify and control devices.

i)  The  hop  limit  of  each  IP  packet  for  a  Site-Local  scope  multicast  message  SHALL  be

configurable and SHOULD default to 10.

j)  When  a  LOCATION  URL  includes  a  literal  IP  address,  that  IP  address  SHALL  match  the
unicast  source  address  used  to  send  the  message.  When  a  LOCATION  URL  includes  a
fully  qualified  domain  name  (FQDN),  the  resolution  of  that  FQDN  SHALL  include  the  IP
address  used  as  the  unicast  source  address.  For  example,  this  means  that  if  mDNS  or
other mechanisms are used to create DNS entries, that DNS translations will need to exist
for all of a device’s IP addresses that are used for discovery and advertisement.

k)  Since devices will multicast NOTIFY and M-SEARCH messages on multiple IP addresses,
receiving  devices  SHALL  consider  all  messages  with
the  same  USN  and
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG or NLS value as being from a single device and select exactly one (1)
address  to  use  in  subsequent  unicast  communication.  When  multiple  multicast  messages
are  received  from  a  single  host  (each  with  different  source  IP  address),  the  receiving
device  SHALL  select  a  destination  address  (from  among  the  source  addresses  of  the
multiple  multicast  messages)  and  LOCATION  URL  to  use  for  subsequent  unicast
communication  with  a  particular  device  by  using  an  algorithm  that  results  in  consistent
address  selection  behavior.  The  default  destination  address  selection  rules  are  described
in RFC 6724, but alternate algorithms can be implemented.

l)  Devices  SHALL  select  a  source  address  to  use  when  responding  to  multicast  messages
according to the selection rules described in RFC 6724. Note that this will mean selecting
a  source  address  that  best  matches  the  destination  address  (the  source  address  of  the
multicast message that the receiving device selected in the above requirement).

m)  Devices  which  multicast  messages  on  multiple  interfaces  (i.e.  IPv4  and  IPv6)  SHALL
ensure  that  the  transmission  start  time  of  each  multicast  message  on  corresponding
interfaces  is  less  than  20ms.  Note:  Compliance  with  this  requirement  will  be  evaluated
under  average  network  conditions.  It  is  understood  that  certain  non-nominal  network
conditions MAY prevent timely transmission on particular interfaces.

Device operation

A device supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously SHALL be advertised using the same
Unique Service Name (USN) on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces and SHALL have identical device
description documents and service description documents when accessed from both protocols.
The URLBase element of the device description document SHALL NOT be used. Dual stacked
devices  should  consider  power  contraints  (such  as  radio  activity  in  battery  powered  devices)
when  sending  multiple  NOTIFY  and  M-SEARCH  messages  (e.g.  grouping  message
transmission by service or address family). These devices SHALL also conform to other multi-
homed descriptions in the respective sections of the document.

A.2.5

Control point operation

Control  points  SHALL  use  the  matching  USNs  of  multiple  IPv4  and  IPv6  announcements  to
treat  multi-address  devices  as  a  single  device.  Dual  stacked  control  points  should  consider
power  contraints  (such  as  radio  activity  in  battery  powered  devices)  when  sending  multiple
NOTIFY  and  M-SEARCH  messages  (e.g.  queuing  messages  and  grouping  message
transmission  by service  or  address family).  In  addition, control  points  SHALL also conform  to
other multi-homed descriptions in the respective sections of this document.

A.3  Addressing

RFC 4862, RFC 4193 and RFC 3315 describe how a physical device obtains an IPv6 address.

IPv6 multicast addresses include a component (scope) which determines the propagation of a
message. The multicast scope for UPnP SHALL be Link-Local or Site-Local scoped. The Site-
Local  scope  is  encompassing  of  Link-Local.  That  is,  Link-Local  scope  is  contained  in  Site-
Local scope.

In  IPv6  networks,  a  Link-Local  IP  address  is  assigned  per  interface  by  the  physical  device,
and  therefore  UPnP  devices  or  control  points  on  IPv6-enabled  devices  will  always  have  a
Link-Local  address.  In  addition,  a  device  or  control  point  MAY  or  MAY  NOT  have  a  Unique
Local  Address  (ULA) or  a  Global  Unicast  Address  (GUA)  available  to  it.   IPv6  devices  or
control  points  are  “multi-homed”  when  they  run  UPnP  on  one  or  more  IPv6  addresses  for  an
interface: a Link-Local address for local link traffic is always available, and a globally routable
address and/or a site-routable address, using a ULA, is available when the router advertises a
prefix  for  use  in  either  stateless  address  autoconfiguration  (SLAAC)  or  DHCPv6  supplied  by
the  home  router.   In  some  scenarios,  devices  or  control  points  MAY  only  have  a  Link-Local
address available to them; reasons for this include underlying device capability, administrative
policy, and availability of ULA and global prefixes. Link-Local addresses are generated by the
physical  device  itself,  without  referring  to  an  outside  router  or  server  such  as  a  DHCPv6
server.

Thus,  there  are  two  considerations  for  UPnP  IPv6  addressing.   The  first  is  availability:   If  the
gateway/router does not advertise a GUA or ULA prefix, then UPnP IPv6 addressing is strictly
Link-Local  addressing.   The  second  is  policy:   This  Annex  recommends  that  multicast
messages  be  sent  using  all  non-temporary  GUA,  ULA,  Link-Local,  and  IPv4  addresses  as  a
source  address,  that  destination  address  selection  (from  among  the  source  addresses  of  the
multicast  messages)use  an  algorithm  that  results  in  consistent  selection  behavior  (default
algorithm  is  defined  in  RFC  6724),  and  subsequent  source  address  selection  follow  the
source address selection procedure described in RFC 6724.

— 114 —

In  addition  to  the  address(es)  assigned  by  this  address  selection  process,  each  device  or
control point, acting as a normal IPv6  node, listens for traffic on several multicast addresses:
link-local  scope  all-nodes  multicast  address  FF02::1;  the  site  scope  all-nodes  multicast
address FF05::1 and multicast addresses of joined groups on each interface.

A.3.1

UPnP Messaging on IPv6 Interfaces

At a minimum, a UPnP Device and a Control Point SHALL both listen and send on IPv6 Link-
Local  scope  multicast  and  unicast  addresses.   A  UPnP  device  SHALL  send  announcements
and multicast  eventing  messages  to, and  listen  for search requests  on  the  assigned-to-UPnP
Link-Local  scope  multicast  addresses  and  receive  connections  on  a  Link-Local  unicast
address  that  it  has  advertised.   A  UPnP  Control  Point  SHALL  listen  for  announcements  and
multicast  eventing  messages  on  the  assigned-to-UPnP  Link-Local  scope  multicast  addresses
and be capable of requesting service definitions using a Link-Local unicast address.

Additionally,  a  UPnP  Device  and  a  Control  Point  SHALL  be  capable  of  both  listening  and
sending on Site-Local scope multicast and site-routable (ULA or GUA) addresses.  Whether or
not  a  particular  Device  or  Control  Point  uses  Site-Local  scope  is  a  policy  decision,  based  on
the  availability  of  site-routable  addresses  and  on  address  selection  policy.   In  order  to
accommodate  routing  across  prefixes  within  a  home  network,  this  specification  REQUIRES
Site-Local scope capability in UPnP Devices and Control Points.

A.3.2

Summary of boot/startup process

•  For IPv4, Auto-IP addressing is performed as specified in section 0 “Addressing” of this document.

•  For  IPv6,  address  assignment  is  performed  as  specified  in  RFC  4862,  RFC  4193,  and  RFC  3315.  This
address  assignment  is  handled  by  the  underlying  IPv6  stack.  That  stack  is  expected  to  make  all  IPv6
addresses available to UPnP applications.

A.3.3

Address Selection and RFC 6724

As described in the normative sections above, UPnP dual-stack Devices operate both at IPv6
multicast  Link-Local  scope  and  Site-Local  scope,  as  well  as  IPv4  multicast,  by  default,  and
advertise their services in SSDP messages sent in Site-Local scope IPv6 multicast packets in
addition  to  Link-Local  scope  multicast.   As  explained  above,  the  default  is  for  UPnP  dual-
stack  devices  to  perform  destination  address  selection  as  explained  in  RFC  6724  (though
other algorithms can  be  used).  Source  address selection  for unicast  messages  is  based  on a
selected destination address and done according to RFC 6724.

A.4  Discovery

The UPnP discovery phase does not substantially change when used over IPv6. All definitions
of  section  1  “Discovery”  of  this  document  SHALL  be  followed,  except  when  a  change  is
mentioned in this section.

IGMP  is the  protocol  used  by IPv4 to ensure  that  incoming  multicast  traffic  is  forwarded by  a
router to the network segment to which the router is attached. IGMP requires that the devices
and  control  points  attached  to  the  network  segment  contact  the  router  to  notify  it  of  their
interest  in  certain  multicast  addresses.  The  protocol  that  provides  this  service  in  IPv6  is
Multicast  Listener  Discovery  protocol  (MLD).  UPnP  Control  points  and  devices  SHALL
participate in the MLD protocol (either directly, or indirectly via APIs to an IPv6 stack) for any
Link-Local  and  Site-Local  scope  UPnP  IPv6  multicast  message.  MLDv1  as  specified  in  RFC
2710  is  sufficient  for  UPnP,  although  more  recent  and  backward-compatible  versions  of  MLD
may be implemented.

IP  addresses  embedded  in  UPnP  messages  and  descriptions  sent  in  response  to  requests
received  on  IPv6  addresses  will  generally  be  literal  addresses  formatted  according  to  RFC
3986  and  RFC  5952  (including  those  in  discovery  messages,  the  URLBase  element  of  the
device description (if specified), and HTTP HOST header fields). In UDA 2.0, together with the
USN,  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  header  field  allows  control  points  to  recognize  when  a
message  received  on  a  different  protocol  or  address  is  effectively  the  same  message  (in  this
case,  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value  will  be  the  same  in  all  announcements  sent  with

different addresses at roughly the same time), as opposed to being a new advertisement from
a  device  which  has  changed  from  one  protocol  or  address  to  another  (in  which  case,  the
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG field value will differ between the old and the new announcement).

A.4.1

OPT and NLS

For  backward  compatibility  with  devices  and  control  points  implementing  UPnP  over  IPv6
according to the original provisions of Annex A to UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0; IPv6
enabled  devices  SHALL  include an  OPT  header field  and NLS  header field and  IPv6 enabled
control points SHALL recognize OPT and NLS header fields. The OPT header field is defined
by  the  HTTP  Extension  Framework  (RFC  2774);  the  OPT  header  field  is  used  (rather  than
MAN) because it is possible for a control point to function without recognizing the NLS header
field,  although  the  user  experience  will  be  suboptimal  (and  IPv4-only  control  points  may  not
recognize  NLS). The NLS field value, contains  a  string value which  SHALL change  whenever
the network configuration of  the  device changes  (e.g.,  if  any  of  the assigned  or calculated IP
addresses  change).  It  is  recommended  that  a  GUID  (in  the  standard  UUID  text  format,  for
example,  “0000002F-0000-0000-C000-000000000046”)  be  used  for  this  purpose,  since  all
UPnP  devices  SHALL already  have the  ability to  generate GUIDs; however,  other techniques
are  possible.  Since  under  UPnP  Device  Architecture  version  1.1  and  UDA  2.0
the
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  field  value  is  required  to  be  unique  on  each  device  reboot  or
configuration change, the field  value of the NLS header field can be set the same as the field
value  of  the  BOOTID.UPNP.ORG  header  field  to  simplify  implementation.  The  NLS  value
SHALL be at least 1 and no more than 64 characters in length.

A.4.2

Advertisement

For IPv6, a device advertises over IPv6 according to the following guidelines:

•  SSDP announcements SHALL be sent to [FF0X::C]:1900 (with “X” being either 2 or 5 and set appropriately
depending  on  the  multicast  scope  upon  which  the  announcement  is  being  sent).  Control  points  SHALL
listen to these addresses and ports to detect when new devices are available on the network.

•  SSDP announcements SHALL be  sent using all non-temporary GUA, ULA, Link-Local, and IPv4 addresses.
For  example,  a  UPnP  device  with  an  IPv4  address,  a  Link-Local  IPv6  address,  a  ULA  and  a  GUA  would
send 4 announcements.

•  As  described

this  document,
in  section  1.2.2  “Device  available  –  NOTIFY  with  ssdp:alive”  of
announcements  sent  over  IPv6  and  IPv4  SHALL  use  the  same  CACHE-CONTROL  field  value  and  SHALL
be  sent  within  a  20  ms  window.  When  all  advertisements,  both  over  IPv4  and  IPv6,  have  expired,  the
control point SHALL assume that the device (or service) is no longer available.

•  The SSDP HOST field value SHALL contain an IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 address.

•  The  SSDP  LOCATION  field  value  contains  the  URL  of  the  root  device  description  document.  Typically,  a
literal  IPv6  address  formatted  according  to  RFC  3986  will  be  used.  An  IPv6  address  SHALL  be  contained
within brackets if a port is specified. The host address in the URL SHALL be valid within the current scope
(the  address  or  scope  on  which  the  announcement  is  being  sent).  Specifically,  a  device  advertising  over
IPv6 SHALL NOT use an IPv4 address in the SSDP LOCATION header field.

•  The OPT and NLS header fields SHALL be included [A.4.1].

The UDA 2.0 example below incorporates this syntax.

   NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1

Advertisement: Device unavailable

— 116 —

When  a  device  and  its  services  are  going  to  be  removed  from  the  network,  the  device
SHOULD  multicast  an  ssdp:byebye  message  corresponding  to  each  of  the  ssdp:alive
messages  it  multicasted  that  have  not  already  expired.  Similarly,  if  an  interface  change
notification
the  device  should  cancel  existing
advertisements. Furthermore, devices need to remember their prior IP addresses in the event
that  some  or  all  of  them  have  changed.  If  that  is  the  case,  new  advertisements  have  to  be
sent, using the same sequence described above.

All  ssdp:byebye  messages  SHALL  be  sent  to  the  IPv6  multicast  address  as  described  in
section A.4.2 “Advertisement”, and SHALL contain the OPT and NLS header fields. Otherwise,

All  ssdp:update  messages  SHALL  be  sent  to  the  IPv6  multicast  address  as  described  in
section A.4.2 “Advertisement”, and SHALL contain the OPT and NLS header fields. Otherwise,
the  behavior  is  the  same  as  IPv4.  A  UDA  2.0  example  of  an  ssdp:update  message  has  the
following syntax.

When  a  control  point  is  added  to  the  network,  it  SHALL  send  multicast  M-SEARCH  requests
on  all  non-temporary  GUA,  ULA,  Link-Local,  and  IPv4  addresses.  Aside  from  using  an  IPv6
multicast  address  and  including  an  IPv6  address  in  the  header  fields,  M-SEARCH  messages
are unchanged. An example of an M-SEARCH message has the following syntax. In addition,
M-SEARCH  messages  MAY  be  unicast  to  IPv6  addresses  of  known  devices,  similar  to  IPv4
unicast M-SEARCH messages.

A.4.6

Search response

To be found, a device SHALL send a response to the source IP address and port that sent the
request  to  the  multicast  address,  and  SHALL  include  the  OPT  and  NLS  header  fields  in  the
message. It SHALL select a source address for this response according to RFC 6724. A UDA
2.0 example of a search response message has the following syntax.

Description documents SHALL be  sent using the same address on which the HTTP GET was
received. Otherwise, behavior is the same as IPv4.

A.6  Control

Responses to SOAP messages during the Control phase SHALL be sent on the same address
on which the request was received. Otherwise, behavior is the same as IPv4.

A.7  Eventing

When  subscribing  to  events  over  IPv6,  the  <deliveryURL>  (or  URLs)  specified  in  the
CALLBACK  header  field  of  the  SUBSCRIBE  message  SHALL  be  reachable  by  the  device.
This means, for example, when sending a SUBSCRIBE request to a device using a Link-Local
IPv6 address, the <deliveryURL> SHALL the same IPv6 address used as the source address,
which is a node’s Link-Local address.

IPv4  addresses  SHALL  NOT  be  included  in  the  CALLBACK  header  field  of  a  SUBSCRIBE
message  sent  over  IPv6.  IPv6  addresses  SHALL  NOT  be  included  in  the  CALLBACK  header
field of a SUBSCRIBE message sent over IPv4.

IPv6  multicast  event  messages  SHALL  be  sent  to  [FF0X::130]:7900  (with  “X”  being  equal  to
the address scope used in advertisement). To receive IPv6 multicast event messages, control
points SHALL listen to these addresses and ports.

To send a multicast event message, a publisher SHALL send a message with method NOTIFY
in  the  following  format.  Values  in  italics  below  are  placeholders  for  actual  values.  Refer  to
section  4.3.3  “Multicast  Eventing:  Event  messages:  NOTIFY”  of  this  document  for  an
explanation  of  the  elements.  All  IP  addresses  contained  in  the  event  SHALL  be  IPv6  format
and scoped as above. A UDA 2.0 example multicast event message has the following syntax.

A.8  Presentation

Responses  to  HTTP  GET  requests  for  presentation  pages  SHALL  be  sent  using  the  same
address on the same interface on which the HTTP GET was received.

Presentation  pages  retrieved  over  IPv6  SHALL  NOT  contain  IPv4  addresses.  Presentation
pages retrieved over IPv4 SHALL NOT contain IPv6 addresses.

It  is  RECOMMENDED that  fully qualified  URLs  to resources  on  the  device are  not  embedded
in HTML presentation pages, but that relative URLs are used instead, so that the host portion
of the embedded URLs does not need to be modified to match the address on which the GET
was received.

Annex B Schemas

[Informative]

B.1  UPnP Device Schema

Below  is  the  UPnP  Device  Schema  for  devices  (see  also  section  2.10,  “UPnP  Datatype
Schema”).  The  elements  it  defines  are  used  in  UPnP  Device  Templates;  they  are  colored
green throughout this specification. Immediately following this is a brief explanation of the XML
Schema  elements,  attributes,  and  values  used.  The  reference  to  XML  Schema  at  the  end  of
the section has further details.

UPnP  1.0  specifies  that  the  namespace  of  the  device  schema  is  “urn:schemas-upnp-
org:device-1-0”.  UPnP  2.0  does  not change that  namespace,  but redefines it  in  a  backwards-
compatible  way  by  restricting  the  order  in  which  elements  can  be  sent  and  REQUIRING  the
presence  of  the  configId  attribute.  Therefore,  the  schema  below  specifies  the  syntax  to
which  a UPnP  2.0 Device  Description Document  has  to  adhere. UPnP  2.0 control points  also
should expect Device Description Documents from UPnP 1.0 devices that  can send elements
in any order, and will not have the configId attribute.

<element>

Defines  a  new  element.  name   attribute  defines  element  name.  type  attribute  defines  the  data  type  for  the
content  of element. minOccurs  attribute defines minimum number of times the  element shall  occur; default is
minOccurs="1";  allowed  elements have minOccurs="0".  maxOccurs  attribute defines maximum number of
times  the  element shall  occur;  default  is maxOccurs="1";  elements  that  can  appear  one  or  more  times  h ave
maxOccurs="unbounded". For a more detailed description, see the XML Schema specification.

<complexType>

Defines  a  new  data  type,  often  containing  sub-elements.  For  a  more  detail  description,  see  the  XML  Schema
specification.

<attribute>

Defines  a  new  attribute  for  the  purpose  of  declaring  in  which  elements  it  MAY  appear.  Like  any  XML  element,
the <attribute> element MAY have attributes of its own. The use  attribute within this element indicates whether
the  attribute  shall  be  present;  allowed  attributes  have  use="optional".  For  a  more  detail  description,  see
the XML Schema specification.

org:service-1-0”. UPnP 2.0 does not change that namespace, but redefines it in a backwards-
compatible  way  by  restricting  the  order  in  which  elements  can  be  sent  and  requiring  the
presence  of  the  configId  attribute.  Therefore,  the  schema  below  specifies  the  syntax  to
which  a  UPnP  2.0  SCPD  has  to  adhere.  UPnP  2.0  control  points  also  should  expect  SCPDs
from UPnP 1.0 devices that can send elements in any order, and will not have the configId
attribute.

Annex C Cloud

[Normative]

C.1

Introduction

C.1.1  What is UPnP™ Cloud Technology (UCA)?

UPnP™  Cloud  technology  is  an  extension  to  the  basic  UPnP  architecture  described  in  0
through  5  enabling  Device  to  Device  connectivity  across  the  internet  (aka  “Cloud”).  It  is
designed  to  re-use,  in  a  managed  way,  as  much  of  the  existing,  easy-to-use,  flexible,
standards-based  connectivity  currently  associated  with  UPnP  when  connecting  across  the
Internet.  Using  the  open  standards  based  Extensible  Messaging  and  Presence  Protocol
(XMPP  –  see  section  C.4)  the  UCA  binds  the  familiar  UPnP  protocols  for  Addressing,
Discovery,  Description,  Eventing,  and  Control 5  to  XMPP  in  a  reliable,  secure  “Cloud”
compatible  way.  This  specific  combination  as  described  in  this  annex  embodies  the  UPnP
Cloud Annex or UCA.

UCA support is allowed. If UCA is implemented for a device or control point then the device or
control  point  shall  support  all  the  required  clauses  of  this  annex  for  a  UCCD  and  UCC-CP
respectively.  A  UCS  may  also  be  implemented.  If  implemented,  the  UCS  shall  support  all
required clauses of a UCS in this annex.

C.1.2

Audience

The  audience  for  this  Annex  includes  UPnP  device  and  control  point  vendors,  UPnP  Cloud
infrastructure  providers,  and  members  of  UPnP  Forum  working  committees,  and  anyone  else
who has a need to understand the technical details of UPnP Cloud protocols.

This  annex  assumes  the  reader  is  familiar  with  the  UDA  Protocols  (HTTP,  SOAP,  SSDP,
GENA, TCP, UDP, IP, XML) as well as RESTful APIs; this annex makes no attempt to explain
them.  This  annex   also  assumes  most  readers  will  be  new  to  XMPP,  and  while  it  is  not  an
XMPP  tutorial,  XMPP-related  issues  are  addressed  in  detail  given  the  centrality  of  XMPP  to
the  UCA.  This  annex  makes  no  assumptions  about  the  readers'  understanding  of  various
programming or scripting languages.

C.1.3

In this Annex

The UPnP Cloud Annex defines both the required binding of the UDA protocols to XMPP and
the  required control point, device, and  infrastructure components  needed  to  implement UPnP
Cloud,  including  Client(UCCD  and  UCC-CP),  Server(UCS), and  add  on  Services (see section
C.7).

Components of the UPnP Device Architecture for addressing, discovery, description, eventing
and  control,  contained  herein  define  only  extensions  or  equivalent  replacements  for  those
protocol  components  required  for  communication  over  XMPP  using  the  UCA.  All  interaction
and  protocol  descriptions  associated  with  the  traditional  UPnP  Device  Architecture  remain
unchanged,  when  using  UCA,  unless  specifically  modified  in  this  specification.  UDA  when
used in a local network remains unchanged.

The  text  in  this  specification  uses  the  following  fonts  to  indicate  the  protocol  components  as
follows:

5 An  equivalent  for  UDA  Presentation  is  not  provided  in  UCA  as  this  is  considered  a  potential  security  issue.  If  a

device or service presentation URL is presented it should be ignore by UCCDs and UCC-CPs.

C.1.4

UDA compared to UCA

Figure C-1 provides a high level comparison of the existing UDA protocol stack with the UCA
protocol  stack 7 .  In  contrast  to  UDA,  all  UCA  communications  are  unicast,  secure,  and
essentially  reliable  since  it  is  over  TCP/IP.  Thus,  the  original  UDP  components  are  not
included  in  the  UCA.  Also,  the  delivery  method  for  the  equivalent  SOAP  and  GENA
components are via XMPP instead of HTTP. It is possible for a device to expose one or more
interfaces  on  both  its  link-local  and  cloud  networks.  Control  points  interacting  with  multiple
interfaces,  including  both  UDA  and  UCA  compatible  devices,  can  determine  if  the  device(s)
are  the  same  by  comparing  their  UDNs  just  as  described  in  the  multi-homed  description  in
UDA.

Device  (aka  UCCD 9)  or  UPnP  Cloud  Capable  Control  Point  (aka  UCC-CP)  connects  through
an  infrastructure  XMPP  Server  (aka  UCS)  to  another  UCCD,  UCC-CP,  or  UCOD.  This  is  a
typical D2D communication scenario.

When UCCDs and UCC-CPs have different users (illustrated) the connection is typically of the
type  Client  A  (UCCD  or  UCC-CP)  connects  to  server  A  which  connects  to  server  B  which
connects  to  Client  B  (UCCD  or  UCC-CP).  When  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  have  the  same  user
(not  illustrated)  the  connection  will  be  of  type  Client  A1  (UCCD  or  UCC-CP)  connects  to
server  A  which connects to Client  A2 (UCCD  or  UCC-CP),  i.e. there is only  one server  in the
path.

Another scenario (bottom) has the UCCDs and UCC-CPs connecting to devices (UCODs) and
services (UCOSs) that exist only in the cloud.

      UCC-CP                          (UCS)                   (UCCD in Cloud)

XMPP  defines  a  technique  for  connecting  over  HTTP  known  as  BiDirection-streams  Over
Synchronous HTTP  (BOSH  [XEP-0138])  which  is targeted for  browser  based  applications  but
not specifically limited to that use case. UCA support for BOSH is described in C.13.

In  some  cases,  communications  is  only  needed  between  the  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  and  a  UCS.
Typical  examples  include:  management  of  status  and  settings  where  a  UCCD  or  UCC-CP
communicates directly with its UCS; creating and publishing PubSub  events where a UCCD or
UCC-CP  communicates  with  an  add-on  service  discovered  on  its  UCS;  or  subscribing  and
retrieving  PubSub events with  the  UCS  of a connected  UCCD or UCC-CP  from  another user.
These communication types are further defined in the next section.

C.1.5

UCA General Communications Paths

As  mentioned  previously,  UCA  offers  two  paradigms  for  communication  1)  UCCDs  and  UCC-
CPs  belonging  to  the  same  user  (see  term  user)  registered  to  the  same  account  (see  term
account)  communicating  with  each  other  and  2)  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  belonging  to  different
users registered to different accounts and possibly on different servers. This is illustrated at a
high  level  in  Figure  C-3  as  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  connected  to  the  mycloud.org  and
theircloud.org  UCSs  respectively.  This  results  in  several  communication  paths  between
devices,  control  points,  servers,  services,  and  users.  These  specific  message  flows  are
enumerated  in  the  next  section  to  facilitate  easier  discussion  in  the  remainder  of  this
specification.

C.1.6

UCA Specific Communication Paths

The  UCA  defines 8 specific  types of communications  7  of  which are  illustrated  in  Figure  C-4.
They are:

1)  communications  between  a  user  (with  a  user  credential)  and  the  UCA  host  server  (UCS)
using  the  defined  UCA  API  for  account  management 10 (see  section  C.5.1),  for  example,
with a browser over HTTP,

2) communications between a UCC-CP or UCCD (with user A credentials) with their UCA host

server A using the UCA protocols,

3) communications between a UCC-CP or UCCD (with user A credentials) with another users
connected  UCC-CP  or UCCD (with user  B credentials) either through the  same UCA host
server A or through two different UCA host servers A and B using the UCA protocols,

4)  communications  between  UCC-CPs  and  UCCDs  (  with  user  A  credentials)  through  their

UCA host server A using the UCA protocols,

5) direct communications between two UCA host servers (A and B) using the XMPP protocols,

this kind of communication between servers is often referred to as "federation",

6)  communications  between  a  user's  UCA  host  server  and  required  UCA  add  on  services,

such as, a PubSub  service or a Multi-User Chat (MUC) conference server,

7) direct communications between a UCC-CP or UCCD (with user A credentials) and a  server
hosting a required UCA add on service, such as publishing or retrieving PubSub events.
8)  direct communications between  a UCC-CP  or  UCCD (with user  A credentials)  and  a UCC-
CP  or  UCCD  (with  user  B  credentials) for  data  direct  data  transfer  as  negotiated  through
the UCA protocols (not shown).

10 Note this also includes creation of the user credential.

C.1.7

UCA Steps as Analogies to UDA

The  following  section  provides  a  high  level  overview  of  the  major  steps  involved  in
establishing a UCA experience.

Step 1: Registration

A  user  registers  their  UCC-CPs  and  UCCDs  with  a  UCA  host  service.  This  is  analogous  to
UDA Addressing. It involves several sub-steps that are described next.

1a)  A  potential  UCA  user  finds  a  UCA  service  provider  or  installs  a  UCA  server  to  connect

their UCCDs and UCC-CPs.

1b)  The  user  creates  a  UPnP  cloud  account  (see  section  C.5.1),  for  example  with  a

companion browser.

1c)  After creating  an  account, the  user starts  a  UCA cloud session between their  UCC-CP or

UCCD and the UCS (from step 1a) using the user credentials from (step 1b).

1d)  The  UCC-CP  or  UCCD  autonomously  creates  a  persistent  and  unique  XMPP  resource  of
general
for
UCCDs  or  user@upnpcloudserver/upnp:controlpoint:resource+unique_identifier  for
UCC-CPs.

type  user@upnpcloudserver/upnp:device:resource+unique_identifier

Step 2: Discovery

A  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  issues  XMPP  <presence>  stanzas.  This  is  analogous  to  UPnP  SSDP
messages. It involves several sub-steps that are described next.

11 Note that in this figure users “jeffrey” and “mary” are the same as general users A and B in related descriptions.

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 141 —

2a)  A  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  sets  its  <presence>  stanza  with  no  @type  attribute  which  is

interpreted as "available" (this is equivalent to an ssdp:alive).

2b)  A  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  sets  its  <presence>  stanza  @type  attribute  to  "unavailable"
(this  is  equivalent  to  an  ssdp:byebye)  or  the  UCS  sends  a  <presence>  stanza  with
@type attribute set to "unavailable" on behalf of a disconnected UCCD or UCC-CP.
2c)  A UCCD whose <presence> stanza status  has  no  @type attribute, which  is  interpreted
as  "available",  sends  a  new  <presence>  stanza  with  a  modified  configIdCloud  element
(this is equivalent to an ssdp:update).

Step 3 Description

A  UCCD  provides  device  type  information  in  its  name  and  version  information  sent  in  its
presence  communication,  along  with  description  information  that  can  be  exchanged  in  an
<iq> stanza  with a UCC-CP. This  is analogous  to UPnP Description. It  involves several  sub-
steps that are described next.

3a)  A  UCCD  sends  a  conforming  version  and  hash  (configIdCloud)  of  its  description  in  its

<presence>stanza.

3b)  A UCC-CP caches  the version  and  hash and  if  it  does not have  a valid description  of the

requests it from the UCCD using an <iq> stanza.

3b)  The  UCCD  and  UCC-CP  complete  a  follow-up  exchange  in  which  the  DDD  and  SCPDs

are exchanged using <iq> stanzas.

Step 4 Eventing

 A UCCD creates and manages a UCA PubSub collection, if it has events, and a UCC-CP
subscribes  to  nodes  in  that  collection  .This  is  analogous  to  UDA  Eventing.  It  involves
several sub-steps that are described next.

4a)  A  UCCD  creates  a  conforming  PubSub  collection  for  UCCD  events  at  the  PubSub

service associated with its UCA server.

4b)  A  UCC-CP  issues  conforming  PubSub  “subscribe”  and  “unsubscribe”  queries  to  a

specific UCCD PubSub node (event).

4c)  A  UCCD  or  UCA  server  issues  conforming  responses  to  the  UCC-CP  acknowledging  the

subscription request usually a “subscribed” or “unsubscribed” message.

4d) A UCCD sends any event to the PubSub service when an event occurs using the required

XMPP message.

Step 5 Control

A  UCC-CP  invokes  an  action  on  a  UCCD  by  exchanging  SOAP  messages  using  the  XMPP
binding  for  SOAP.  This  is  analogous  to  UDA  Control.  It  involves  several  sub-steps  that  are
described next.

5a) A UUC-CP invokes a SOAP based action on a UCCD using an <iq> stanza,
5b) The UCCD sends a proper SOAP response or error message to the UCCD using an <iq>

response stanza.

5c)  The  response  can  include  elements  filtered  to  reflect  additional  negotiated  and  secured
transport  for  direct  UCCD  to  UCCD  or  direct  UCC-CP  to  UCCD  media  or  data  exchanges
where required or efficient.

General Cloud Terms and Definitions

Cloud,  in  the  context  of  UPnP,  is  the  logical  domain,  not  in  the  user’s  home(s),  where  their
UCODs, UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs connect,  their UCBSs  execute,  and their cloud  based content
resides.

Domain is a scoped access to a subset of all available cloud devices, services and users.

Account is a domain in the cloud consisting of a username and a credential. Also, the account
can  contain  ancillary  information  such  as  address,  telephone  number,  email  information  and
possibly transactional information such as credit card information. An extended concept of an
account  is  the  combination  of  devices,  services  and  users  registered  or  interacting  with  the
account.

User, in the context of UPnP cloud, is a uniquely identifiable participant that interacts with the
UPnP cloud ecosystem. A user can be an account owner or participant and can be associated
with multiple cloud accounts.

Login  is an identification  process that allows  a specific  user to  access  their cloud  account by
confirming their username and credential. Login can also refer to the act of starting an active
session with the cloud account. The login can be automated once initial login succeeds. Some
minimal behavior equivalent to UPnP Public Role [DP] could be identified.

Owner  is  a  user  that  has  management  rights  over  an  account  (or  group)  and  the  devices,
services, and users allowed access within that account.

Home, in the context of UPnP cloud, is the logical network(s) or LAN(s) where a user’s UHOD
and CPDevs are connected.

UPnP  Cloud  Capable  (UCC)  means  that  the  device  or  control  point  (CP)  is  capable  of
interaction with UPnP Cloud Based Services.

Invitation  is  the  initiation  part  of  registering  a  device,  service,  or  user  to  a  cloud  account  or
cloud group.

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 143 —

Invited  User  is  a  user  from  a  cloud  account  that  has  been  invited  to  have  access  to  devices
and  services  in  a  different  cloud  account.  The  devices  and  services  access  can  be  granted
with a per-device, per-group, or per-service granularity.

C.2.3

Device and Control Point Terms and Definitions

UPnP  Cloud  Capable  Control  Point  (UCC-CP)  is  a  control  point  (CP)  that  can  interact  with
UCCDs, UCODs, and UCOSs directly. Note that a UCC- CP is not a UCCD.

UPnP  Cloud  Capable  Device  [Mobile]  (UCCD-[M])  is  a  non-virtual  UPnP  device  that  can
interact directly with other UCCDs and UCODs via the cloud, when in the home it can interact
with  legacy  devices  over  a  home  network.  The  term  UCCD-M  can  be  used  to  indicated  that
the  UCCD  has  mobility  (cell  phone,  tablet)  that  is,  it  will  frequently  get  IP  connectivity  from
outside  of  the  home  network  as  opposed  to  a  UCCD  that  is  a  100  inch  Smart  TV  which  can
connect  directly  to  the  internet  but  is  likely  to  stay  in  the  same  LAN.  Note  that  a  UCCD-M  is
also a UCCD.

UCOD  (UPnP  Cloud  Only  Device)  is  a  UPnP  device  that  resides  only  in  the  cloud,  more  or
less a virtual device. Note that a UCOD is not a UCCD.UHOD (UPnP Home Only Device) is a
device that only works in a home (LAN) network, that is a “legacy” device [UDA1.0], [UDA1.1],
an example is MediaServer:1. It can be added to a cloud account via a CPDev
.
Invited  Device  is  a  device  from  a  cloud  account  that  has  received  an  invitation  to  be
registered to a different cloud account.

C.2.4

Service Terms and Definitions

UPnP  Cloud  Based  Service  (UCBS)  are  UPnP  services  designed  to  support  the  UPnP  cloud
ecosystem.  This  is  a  broader  category  than  a  UCOD  and  UCOS  and  encompasses  all  cloud
related components.

UPnP  Cloud  Only  Service  (UCOS)  is  a  service  that  can  reside  only  in  the  cloud  and  might
only be compatible with UHODs via a CPDev.

Cloud  Service  is  a  service  originating  from  a  cloud  account  that  is  not  part  of  a  physical
Device.

Service  Provider  (SP)  is  a  cloud  based  entity  that  provides  cloud  accounts  or  UCOS(s)
possibly including content.

Service  Provider  Cloud  Service  (SPCS)  is  a  UCOS  originating  from  a  Service  Provider
available to a cloud account.

Invited  Cloud  Service  is  a  cloud  service  from  a  cloud  account  or  service  provider  (SP)  that
has received an invitation to be registered to a different cloud account.

Published Service  is a service originating from a device from a home network advertised to a
cloud account.

C.2.5

Groups

Cloud  Group  is  a  default  set  of  UPnP  devices  connected  to  a  cloud  account,  often  initially
from the same LAN. This group can contain UHODs, UCODs, UCOSs, UCCDs and UCC-CPs.
A device can belong to more than 1 cloud group.

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 144 —

Cloud Only Group is a default set of UPnP devices connected to a cloud account. This group
can  contain  UCODs,  UCOSs,  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs.  A  device  can  belong  to  more  than  1
cloud only group.

Custom Cloud Group is a configured and managed set of UCCDs, UCODs, UHODs, UCC-CPs
and  users  for  the  purpose  of  managing  interaction  with  and  registration  to  other  cloud
accounts and providing limited subsets of device, service, and user interactions.

Home Only Group is a default set of UPnP devices connected to a cloud account. This group
can contain only UHODs.

Invited Group is a cloud, custom, or home group  that has received  an invitation  to  register  to
a different cloud group.

C.4  General XMPP Features

This  section  provides  an  overview  of  basic  XMPP.  The  full  XMPP  specifications  and
descriptions can be found at http://xmpp.org.

C.4.1

XMPP Jabber IDs or JIDs

An XMPP Jabber (historical) ID or JID is composed of three parts the localpart (analog to
user  name), the domainpart (analog to server  name) and  the resourcepart (in the  UPnP
case, a device or control point name). Together they form a full JID or the "Cloud" address
of  a  UCCD  or  UCC-CP.  In  XMPP  communication  can  occur  between  different  levels  of
addressing: server to server, client to server, and client to client.

When  UCA  server  to  server  communication  occurs  it  is  typically  sent  as  an  XMPP
domainpart  to  domainpart  and,  in  the  case,  of  this  specification,  will  appear  as
mycloud.org to theircloud.org. This type of communication is generally out of scope for
the UCA.

When UCA client (UCCD or UCC-CP) to server communication occurs it is typically 12 sent as
an XMPP  localpart@domainpart/resourcepart to a localpart@domainpart.

However,  in  many  cases,  especially  presence,  UCA  client  communication  "to"  and  "from"  is
added by the Server or UCS.

UCCD:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:MediaServer:4:uuid:abcd-1234
<presence/>

UCS:mycloud.org (to available resource …abcd-wxyz)
<presence
   to="jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:
         MediaServer:4:uuid:abcd-wxyz"
   from="jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:
         MediaServer:4:uuid:abcd-1234"/>

Note that in this example the user or localpart  is jeffrey.
Communication  between  a  UCCD  (UCC-CP)  and  its  server  is  somewhat  analogous  to
communication between a device (control point) and its local network.

When  UCA  client  to  client  communication  occurs  it  will  be  between  full  JIDs  as
localpart@domainpart/resourcepart  to  a  localpart@domainpart/resourcepart
but relayed through the client's (UCCD or UCC-CP) server first.

•  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  belonging  to  user  A  on  Server  A  and  connecting  to  user  A's  other
UCCDs or UCC-CPs will send UCA communication using a Client A1 to Server A to Client
A1 model.

•  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  belonging  to  user  A1  on  Server  A  and  connecting  to  user  A2  on
server A UCCDs or UCC-CPs will send UCA communication using a Client A1 to Server A
to Client A2 model.

•  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  belonging  to  user  A1  on  Server  A  and  connecting  to  user  B1  on
server B UCCDs or UCC-CPs will send UCA communication using a Client A1 to Server A
to Server B to Client B model.

Note  that  not  all  client  to  client  communication  is  expected  to  go  through  the  servers;  high
bandwidth transactions will be negotiated through XMPP communication and handled in more
efficient ways (see section C.9).

XMPP stanzas

C.4.1.1
There  are  three  stanza  types  defined  for  XMPP:  <iq>,  <presence>,  and  <message>.  In
general,  <presence>  is  broadcast  between  a  XMPP  client  to  an  XMPP  server  for  additional
caching  or  distribution.  A  response  is  not  expected  (although  the  server  may  generate
additional stanz as). An <iq> stanza always results in a response although it may be an error
response.  Typically  this  stanza  is  also  client  to  server,  or  server  to  server.  A  <message>
stanza  is  typically  sent  client  to  client  and  usually  does  not  require  a  response,  but  one  can
be defined if necessary.

C.4.1.2

<iq> stanzas

XMPP <iq> stanzas have the following defined @type attribute allowed values: "get", "set",
"result",  and  "error".  They  are  primarily  intended  for  request/response  interactions.  An
<iq> stanza can contain only  one  payload and (for errors) an  error child,  that  is  errors  might
contain error plus original payload (see [RFC-6121], section 8.2.3).

C.4.1.3

<presence> stanzas

XMPP  <presence>  stanzas  have  the  following  defined  @type  attribute  allowed  values
which  are  related  to  UCA:  "unavailable"  and  no  @type  attribute  present,  which  is
interpreted  as  "available".  They  are  used  primarily  as  an  online  ("available"),  off-line
("unavailable")  switch  which  is  sent  to  all  subscribers 13 connected  entities  or  in  the  UPnP
case UCCDs and UCC-CPs.

C.4.1.4

<message> stanzas

XMPP  <message>  stanzas  have  the  following  defined  @type  attribute  allowed  values:
"normal",  "chat" ,  "groupchat",  "headline",  and  " error".  The  <message>  stanza  is  the
primary push method in XMPP.

Embedding  of  other  XML  namespace  elements  in  stanza  payloads  is  supported,  thus  UPnP
will define its own payloads as needed.

C.5  Creating a Device or Control Point Resource

C.5.1  Finding a UCS
Before  a  UCC-CP  or  UCCD  can  be  connected  using  UCA,  a  UCS  must  be  discovered  and  a
user account created. UPnP describes the following methods for discovering UCA connective
services.

Known publicly accessable UCS, UPnP Forum provides links to UCSs that have passed UCA
UCS  certification  and  that  are  publicly  accessible.  This  list  is  maintained  at  hyperlink
"http://cloud.upnp.org/ucs/ver/x.x"  where x.x  indicates the UCA server version  the  UCS  is
certified to. Valid versions for this specification are "1.0".

It  is  expected  that  versions  above  1.0  will  be  released.  These  will  be  enumerated  at  the
URI http://cloud.upnp.org/ucs/ as hyperlinks of the form "x.x", for example:

1.0

1.1

2.0

13 A  subscriber  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  is  either  a resource  of  the  same  user  account  or  an  external  UCCD  or  UCC-
CP subscribed to another user's UCCD or UCC-CP presence.

— 147 —

URIs  at  the  next  level  "http://cloud.upnp.org/ucs/ver"  would  contain  hyperlinks  to  the
UCSs accessible 14 for each version, for example:

link http://cloud.upnp.org/ucs/ver/1.0 contains 2 hyperlinks

    http://mycloud.org

    http://theircloud.org

Vendor  defined.  One  or  more  UCSs  are  hardcoded  into  the  UCC-CP  or  UCCD.  Upon  initial
startup the user is provided an interface to create an account. After initial account creation
and login the UCC-CP or UCCD may connect automatically.

Add  on  services,  UPnP  Forum  may  define  DCPs

that  allow  a

locally  discoverable

infrastructure device to advertise a service that provides discovery of a UCS.

C.5.2  Account Creation

In  general,  it  is  expected  that  most  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  will  have  some  form  of  UI
supporting  account  registration;  however  this  could  also  be  done  through  a  web  interface  to
the supporting UCS using BOSH [XEP-0124].

[XEP-0133]  describes  best  practices  for  server  to  server  and  server  to  component  account
management.  For  basic  account  setup,  update,  deletion,  and  exchange  the  following  user
form variables (var) are defined:

•  accountjid,
•  password,
•  password-verify
•  email,
•  given_name,
•  surname

It is highly recommended that any account creation-management API, at a minimum, provision
for the input, storage, and protection of the above information.

C.5.3

Authentication

For  each  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  that  a  user  will  connect  to  their  cloud  account,  they  will  have  to
login  to  a  server  supporting  the  UCA  server  profile  specified  here.  When  initial  login  occurs,
the  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  uses  the  bare  JID  or  localpart@domainpart  (for  this  example
jeffrey@mycloud.org)  and  completes  the  preconditions  (stream  establishment,  security
negotiation (TLS, SASL) described in [RFC-6120], also known as XMPP-CORE. This process
is illustrated in Figure C-5.

Note that this section is a composite of XMPP specifications [RFC-6120], [RFC-6121], [RFC-
6122].

The  example  protocol  flows  illustrated  here,  start  at  the  XMPP  SASL  stream  negotiation
phase,  after  the  initial  TCP/TLS  connection  has  been  negotiated  (again  see  [RFC-6120]  for
details). The  first UPnP  entity  to connect  to jeffrey@mycloud.org  is  a UCCD, specifically
a MediaServer:4 with UDN uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950. Since the
UCS  has  been  determined  to  support  UCA  a-priori  (see  section  C.5.1)  it  is  known  that  the
UCS  can  successfully  bind  a  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  and  support  required  add-on  UCA  services,
such  as,  a  UPnP  profiled  PubSub.  This  can  be  verified  using  [XEP-0030]  and  will  be
described later in this specification.

Note the orange highlighted text indicates pre-SASL TLS secured exchanges.

C.5.4  Binding Devices and Control Points as a Resource
Once  the  secure  stream  has  been  negotiated  for  the  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  with  the  UPnP  cloud
server  (UCS)  it  will  send  an  XMPP  <bind>  notification  as  indicated  in  the  example  above
where:

If  the  binding  resource  is  a  UCCD  it  shall  bind  with  a  resourcepart  as  the  ordered
concatenation  of  the  value  of  the  <deviceType>  and  the  value  of  the  <UDN>  separated
by a ":" either
resourcepart = urn:schemas-upnp-
org:device:deviceType:ver:uuid:device-UUID

or

•

resourcepart = urn:domain-name:device:deviceType:ver:uuid:device-UUID

If the binding resource is a UCC-CP it shall bind with a resourcepart as either:
the ordered concatenation of the value of urn:schemas-upnp-org:cloud-1-
o
0:ControlPoint:ver:  and either the value of control point <ID> as defined in
DeviceProtection Service [DP] if DeviceProtection Service is implemented , that is,
resourcepart = urn:schemas-upnp-org:cloud-1-0:ControlPoint:ver:<ID>

or
o  a UUID value meeting the same requirements as the device-UUID that is,

resourcepart = urn:schemas-upnp-org:cloud-1-0:ControlPoint:ver:uuid

For UCA 1.0, the value of the control point version ver is "1".

Continuing  the  example  from  above,  upon  receiving  the  bind  notification,  the  UCCD
"MediaServer:4" will now bind as:

jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-org:device-1-
1:MediaServer:4:uuid: e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950

by sending an <iq> bind request as follows:

C:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-
org:device:MediaServer:4:uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950
<iq
   to="mycloud.org"
   from="jeffrey@mycloud.org"
   type="set"
   id="yhc13a95"
   <bind xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind"/>
      <resource>
         urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:MediaServer:4:
           uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950
      </resource>
   </bind>
</iq>

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 151 —

Note, that the value of the iq@id attribute is determined by the endpoint (usually a UCS) 15.
A UCS shall accept a conforming request as a new resource with the response:

UCS:mycloud.org
<iq
   to="jeffrey@mycloud.org
   from="mycloud.org"
   type="result"
   id="yhc13a95"
   <bind xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-bind"/>
      <jid>jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:
           MediaServer:4:uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950</jid>
   </bind>
</iq>

Error messages received prior to resource binding shall conform to standard XMPP messages
as defined in [RFC-6120] and are not considered a UCA error.

Note that a properly implemented UCCD or UCC-CP should not create a resource uniqueness
conflict as described in section 7.7.2.2  [RFC-6120], that is uniqueness is guaranteed between
all  UCCD  and  UCC-CP  resources.  A  UCS  should  not  attempt  to  change  the  name  of  a
requested  resource,  if  it  does,  the  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  requesting  the  resource  bind  shall
disconnect the stream and try to reconnect according to standard XMPP procedures. A UCCD
or  UCC-CP  shall  not  accept  an  XMPP  bind  that  does  not  conform  to  its  advertised  as
described above..

Upon  a  successful  bind,  the  MediaServer:4  UCCD  is  now  connected  with  its  own  globally
unique full JID . This is the UCCD cloud address. Note, a UCCD is allowed to have multiple
cloud addresses.

C.5.4.1

Limitations on stanza redirection.

— 152 —

In  some  cases,  XMPP  allows  for  the  redirection  of  stanzas  to  an  alternative  "available"
resource  (see  [RFC-6120]  section  10.5.4)  when  a full  JID  matching  the  "to"  attribute  is
not  "available".  For  example,  a  message  of  type  4  intended  for  jeffrey's  MediaRender
(which is "unavailable") could be redirected to jeffey's MediaServer (which is "available"). For
UCA communications this is prohibited as follows:

UCCDs and UCC-CPs shall ignore any received  stanza that does not have a "from" attribute
with a value compliant to a UCA resource as defined above with the following exceptions:

•  The  stanza  is  a  response  to  a  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  request  to  the  UCS  or  affiliated  service
(such as PubSub). Note that the UCCD or UCC-CP should check the stanza @id attribute
to confirm.

•  The stanza is a notification from the UCS or affiliated service.
•  The  stanza  is  a  message  specifically  identified  in  this  specification  indicating  the  allowed

override of the prohibition.

A  UCS  should  refrain  from  redirecting  valid  UCA  messages  sent  to  an  "unavailable"  UCA
resource  to  an  "available"  UCA  resource  and  instead  send  appropriate  error  messages  as
described in [RFC-6120].

Note that UCCDs and UCC-CPs are allowed to be combined with other applications that share
a  common  XMPP  interface,  such  as  "chat".  However,  non-UCA  stanzas  should,  instead  be
sent  to  the  bare  JID  and  resource  priority  used  for  any  additional  routing.  Figure  C-6
illustrates  these  two  scenarios.  In  case  1,  a  MediaServer  sends  a  UCA  stanza  to  an
"unavailable" MediaRender. Instead of delivering the stanza to the "available" MediaServer or
UCC-CP  the  appropriate  error  is  returned.  In  case  2,  a  non-UCA  stanza  addressed  to  the
bare  JID  is  sent  and  delivered  to  the  "available"  resource  with  the  highest  priority,  in  this
case  Jeffrey's  UCC-CP;  in  other  terms,  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  should  ignore  stanzas  of
type="chat" unless a chat interface is provided.

C.5.4.2

Handling resource priority

The  use  of  priority  in  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  is  allowed  in  UCA,  however  its  behavior  is  not
guaranteed since XMPP allows a server to override requested priority as described below.

From [RFC-6121] section 4.7.2.3
The client's server MAY override the priority value provided by the client (e.g.
in  order  to  impose  a  message  handling  rule  of  delivering  a  message  intended  for  the
account's bare JID to all of the account's available resources). If the server does so
it MUST communicate the modified priority value when it echoes the client's presence back to
itself and sends the presence notification to the user's contacts (because this modified priority
value  is  typically  the  default  value  of  zero  communicating  the  modified  priority  value  can  be
done by not including the <priority/> child element).

However, it is suggested that UCS recognize the following recommended priorities
for UCCDs and UCC-CPs:

UCCDs with no additional XMPP features:  priority range of [-100 to -33].
UCCDs with additional XMPP features:
priority range of [      1 to  66].
UCC-CPs with no additional XMPP features: priority range of [  -66 to   - 1].
priority range of [    33 to 100].
UCC-CPS with additional XMPP feature:

Embedded Devices

UCA  does  not  support  embedded  devices  as  described  in  2.  All  UCCDs  that  advertise
embedded  devices  in  their  UDA  DDD  shall,  for  each  embedded  device  (sub-element
<deviceType  of  DDD  element  <deviceList>),  connect  and  bind  a  separate full  JID  on
its cloud  interface using  that  deviceType and the UDN of the related embedded  device  (see

element and <specVersion> element added so that it is a conforming DDD.

C.6  Presence and Discovery

Presence (Analog to NOTIFY with ssdp:alive)

C.6.1
A  UCCD  shall  announce  its  availability  by  sending  an  XMPP  < presence>  stanza  with  no
@type  attribute  which  is  interpreted  as  "available",  and  with  the  <uc>  element  (see  [RFC-
6121] section 4.7.3 Extended Content) advertizing the current UCCD configuration. This is the
analog of a device NOTIFY with ssdp:alive.

The template for the UCCD <presence> stanza is:

<presence>
   <uc xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:cloud-1-0">
      <configIdCloud hash="uda|sha-256">vendor calculated value
                                     as described below
      </configIdCloud>
   </uc>
</presence>

<presence>

Required. Shall be implemented according to [RFC-6120]. Case sensitive.

<uc>

Required.  Type
is  <XML>.  Single  valued.  Shall  have  “urn:schemas-upnp-
org:cloud-1-0”  as  the  value  for  the  xmlns  attribute;  this  references  the  UPnP
Cloud  Schema  (described  below).  Case  sensitive.  Shall  have  one  of  the  following
values.

<configIdCloud>

Required.  Type  is  <XML>.  Single  Valued.  Case  sensitive.  Value  shall  be

is  not

Note,  the  hash  calculation  is  for  self-consistency  between  device  versions
and
intended  for  verifying  software  versions.  However,  no
additional  characters  shall  be  included  between  the  concatenated  DDDs,
SCPDs,  and  Base64  encoded  icon  binaries,  that  is,  the  hash  is  calculated
over a single character string.

@hash
Required. xsd:string. Case sensitive. The following values are defined:

"uda"  indicates  that  the  configIdCloud  value  is  the  xsd:string
equavalent to the configId xsd:int value  (see 2.3).

"sha-256"  indicates  that  the  calculated  hash  of  the  device
description is calculated using the SHA-256 algorithm [Ref].

Note  that  this  template,  or  any  other  template  in  the  UCA,  does  not  prohibit  the  use  of  any
additional,  valid  XML  components,  especially,  those  defined  by  the  XMPP  Standards
Foundation  (XSF),  as  long  as  they  do  not  directly  contradict  the  values  defined  in  the  UCA
and  are  properly  identified  by  valid  XML  namespaces.  However,  do  not  expect  UCCDs  and
UCC-CPs to understand XMPP messages embedded in UCA specific elements.

Continuing  the  example  from  above  the  MediaServer:4  UCCD  would  send  a  <presence>
stanza as follows:

UCCD:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-
org:device:MediaServer:4:uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950

      </configIdCloud>
   </uc>
</presence>

A  UCCD  announcing  initial  presence  will  also  need  to  configure  their  icon  metadata/data
and event PubSub  as described later in this Annex.

A  UCC-CP  shall  announce  its  presence  (essentially  for  discovering  UCCDs)  by  sending  a
<presence>  stanza  with  no  @type  attribute,  which  is  interpreted  as  "available",  as
described in the template below:

<presence/>

<presence>

Required. Shall be implemented according to [RFC-6120]. Case sensitive.

A UCS shall broadcast the received UCCD or UCC-CP <presence> stanza to all subscribed
UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  connected  to  the  users  account  and  add  the  @to  and  @from
attributes as indicated below.

16 Examples show use of hash="sha-256".

From [RFC-6121] section 4.2.2
The  user's  server  (US)  MUST  also  broadcast  initial  presence  from  the  user's  newly
"available" resource to all of the user's "available" resources, including the resource that
generated the presence notification in the first place (i.e., an entity is implicitly subscribed to
its own presence).

The template for the outgoing UCS <presence> stanza for a UCCD is:

<presence
   from="localpart@domainpart/resourcepart of UCCD sending presence
         conforming to section C.5.4"
   to="localpart@domainpart/resourcepart of UCCD or UCC-CP subscribed
         to presense conforming to section C.5.4">
   <uc xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:cloud-1-0">
      <configIdCloud hash="sha-256">vendor calculated value as described below
      </configIdCloud>
   </uc>
</presence>

and for a UCC-CP is:

<presence
   from="localpart@domainpart/resourcepart of UCC-CP sending presence
         conforming to section C.5.4"
   to="localpart@domainpart/resourcepart of UCCD or UCC-CP subscribed
         to presense conforming to section C.5.4">
</presence>

Note  that  the  @from  and  @to  attributes  are  not  included  in  the  UCC-CP  and  UCCD
<presence>  stanzas  to  the  UCS  but  are  added  by  the  UCS  to  the  outgoing  <presence>
stanzas as follows:

@from

Required.  Shall  be  implemented  according  to  [RFC-6120],  that  is,  only  when
multiple  resources  are  implemented.  Shall  have  a  value  of  the  full  JID  of  the
UCCD or UCC-CP announcing presence. Case sensitive (for resource part only).

@to

Recommended.  Shall  be  implemented  according  to  [RFC-6120].  Shall  have  a  value
of  the  JID  of  the  subscribed  UCCD  or  UCC-CP.  Case  sensitive  (for  resource  part
only).

Continuing  the  previous  example,  and  assuming  for  now  the  MediaServer: 4  UCCD  is  the
only UCCD or UCC-CP currently defined for the jeffrey  account, the server would send the
single <presence> stanza below:

UCS:mycloud.org
<presence
   to="jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas- upnp-org:device:
        MediaServer:4:uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950"
   from="jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas- upnp-org:device:
        MediaServer:4:uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950">
   <uc xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:cloud-1-0">

         jNwTQLAos+iQRmkykrNHk6YDvqxcCSP6dF8FZ1VhXBA=

   </uc>
</presence>

A  second  UCCD  is  now  added  to  jeffrey@mycloud.org  account.  A  MediaRender:3
UCCD  with  an  embedded,  second  MediaRenderer:3  device.  On  the  local  network  side  it  is
advertised  with  a  configId  value  of  3.  On  the  cloud  interface  it  will  be  advertised  as  two

separate devices. Assuming the two devices have already executed a proper  resource bind
as described in section C.5.4, the following presence exchange will occur.

MediaRenderer:3  instance  1  will  send  its  presence.  The presence  will  be  broadcast  to  all
"available"  resources  on  jeffrey's  mycloud.org  account.  In  this  case,  to  UCCD
MediaServer:4 and UCCD MediaRenderer: 3 instance one.

Note  that  the configIdCloud  element  value  will  be  calculated  on  the  DDD,  SCPDs,  and  icon
binaries  of the  individual advertised  UCCD  instance  and  will be different for  the two resulting
MediaRenderer:3 devices (as shown in the two presence examples below).

UCCD:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-

A UCC-CP is now connected and its presence is sent to the UCS as:

UCC-CP:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-org:cloud-1-
0:ControlPoint:1:ad93e8f5-634b-4123-80ca-225886a5c0e8
<presence/>

and subsequently sent to each subscribed UCCD and UCC-CP with the appropriate
@to and @from attributes added.

The  cloud  discovery  (analog  to  NOTIFY)  behavior  for  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs  can  be
summarized as:

•  UCCDs and UCC-CPs bind a resource  as described in section C.5.4 of this specification.
•  UCCDs,  after  successfully  binding  a  conforming  resource,  announce  their  presence
with  a  <presence>  stanza  with  no  @type  attribute,  which  is  interpreted  as  "available",
and whose body conforms to section C.6.1 of this specification applying to UCCDs.

•  UCC-CPs,  after  successfully  binding  a  conforming  resource,  announce  their presence
with  a  <presence>  stanza  with  no  @type  attribute,  which  is  interpreted  as  "available",
and whose body conforms to section C.6.1 of this specification applying to UCC-CPs.

The  cloud  discovery  behavior  (analog  to  multicast  of  the  NOTIFY)  of  an  XMPP  cloud  server
supporting the UPnP protocol capability can be summarized as:

•  A  UCS  broadcast  any  <presence>  stanza  with  no  @type  attribute,  which  is  interpreted
as  "available",  received  from  any  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  resource  to  all  connected  and

"available"  UPnP  UCCD  and  UCC-CP  resources  with  the  <presence>  stanza  body
unaltered.

•  A  UCS  broadcast  the  last  presence  with  @type  attribute  value  of  "unavailable"
received  from  any  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  resource  to  all  connected  and  "available"  UPnP
UCCDs and UCC-CPs with the <presence> stanza body intact.

The individual presence exchange between the UCCDs, UCC-CPs, and UCS for an N
connected UPnP scenario is illustrated in

C.6.3

Presence update (analog to NOTIFY with ssdp:update)

If  a UCCD  is modified  in  any  manner that results  in a change  in  its DDD  or any  of its  SCPDs
or any of its icon binaries (for devices that implement UDA 1.1 or higher this is equivalent to a
change  in  the  configId),  then  it  shall  issue  a  new  <presence>  stanza  with  the  new
configIdCloud  element  value.  This  is  analog  to  an  NOTIFY  with  “ssdp:update”.  The
<presence>  stanza  shall  also  conform  to  the  template  in  section  C.6.1.  A  UCCD  that
changes only BOOTID(s) on the local interface shall not send an updated presence.

A  UCCD  updating  its  presence  will  also  need  to  update  its  icon  metadata/data
and event PubSub as described later in this Annex.

For  example  purposes,  assume  the  UCCD  MediaServer:4  from  the  previous  example
changes its configuration. It would send a new <presence> stanza much like the following:

UCCD:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-

A UCS shall add the @to and @from attributes as previously indicated.

C.6.4  Presence "unavailable" (Analog to NOTIFY with ssdp:byebye)
At  any  point,  a  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  may  make  itself  "unavailable"  on  its  cloud  interface(s)  by
sending  a  <presence>  stanza  with  @type  attribute  value  of  "unavailable"  to  its  UCS  as
described in the template below:

<presence
   type="unavailable" />

<presence>

Required. Shall be implemented according to [RFC-6120]. Case sensitive.

@type

Required.  Shall  be  implemented  according  to  [RFC-6120].  Shall  have  a  value  of
"unavailable".

This is the analog of a NOTIFY with ssdp:byebye.

Note  that  a  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  is  not  required  to  make  itself  "unavailable"  on  its  cloud
interface(s)  just  because  it  has  left  one  or  all  of  its  locally  connected  interfaces,  that  is,  it  is
assumed that the UCCD or UCC-CP will often keep itself alive on its cloud interfaces.

UCCD:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-
org:device:MediaServer:4:uuid: e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950
<presence
   type="unavailable"/>

A UCS shall add the @to and @from attributes as previously indicated.

C.6.5  Service Level Discovery
Currently  UCA  does  not  include  a  mechanism  to  provide  filtered  Discovery,  for  example,
finding  a  particular  service  among  "available"  UCCDs.  This  is  primarily  because  a  significant
amount  of  information  is  implied  by  the  full  JID  of  the  UCCD  and  the  trade-off  of  having
additional granularity would not compensate for the additional UCS traffic. Instead, it is highly
recommended  that  a  UCC-CP  cache  the  configIdCloud  value  of  each  UCCD  along  with  the
devices DDD, SCPDs, and icons (if advertised). If, upon subsequent received presence, the
configIdCloud  value  has  changed  the  UCC-CP  should  check  to  see  if  services  have  been
updated and re-cache as needed. Also, if vendor defined UCCDs are encountered; UCC-CPs
should attempt to learn the services provided by these UCCDs and associate them with future
presence of similar UCCDs.

Chattiness – pings! It is recommended to use XMPP ping sparingly; a ping rate of 30
minutes is recommended.

DDD and SCPD "get"

C.6.6  IQ:Query for DDD and SCPD Exchange (analog of HTTP GET for DDD and SCPD)
C.6.6.1
A  UCC-CP  shall  retrieve  UCCD  DDDs  and  SCPDS  using  the  <iq>  stanza  with  the  @type
attribute  value  of  "get"  as  described  in  the  following  template.  This  is  the  analog  of  using
HTTP GET to exchange DDDs and SCPDs in the UDA.

Note that since only one UDA device is "available" in a UCCD there is no need to include any
hierarchy in the DDD/SCPD <iq> request stanza.

C.6.6.2

DDD and SCPD "result" or "error"

A  UCCD  receiving  a  valid  UCC-CP  request  as  described  in  section  C.6.6.1  shall  return  an
<iq>  stanza  with  the  @type  attribute  value  of  "result",  assuming  no  other  XMPP  related
errors  are  detected,  and  include  the  <query>  child  element  with  either  an  @type  attribute
value  of  "described"  or  "error"  and  the  associated  device  XML  or  UCA  errorCode  as
described  in  the  template  below.  This  is  the  analog  of  the  HTTP  GET  response  of  UDA  with

shall be "error". See section  C.10 for further description.

Note that the XML shall be escaped as described in the UDA.

UCS  shall  support  TLS  compression,  as  well  as,  basic  compression  of  XMPP  stanzas  using
zlib as defined in [XEP-0138].

UCCDs and UCC-CPs are highly recommended to support TLS compression, as well as, basic
compression of XMPP stanzas using zlib as defined in [XEP-0138]. When BOSH [XEP-0138]
is used, TLS and stanza compression should not be used and instead HTTP level
compression negotiated.

Typically  DDD  and  SCPD  XML  using  the  recommended  compression  will  achieve
compression efficiencies in the 75 to 90 percent range for XMPP stanzas. It is highly
recommended  that  the  UCCDs,  UCC-CPs  and  UCSs  for  this  version,  "1.0",  support
a minimum of 64 Kbyte stanzas.

The control point from the continuing example requests the MediaServer :4 DDD.

UCA uses the XMPP Publication-Subscribe (PubSub) service  [XEP-0060] as the cloud analog
to  UPnP  eventing.  A  PubSub  service  is  similar  to  event  subscribe  (section  4.1.2)  and
unsubscribe (section 4.1.4), however an intermediate entity (the PubSub service running on a
PubSub  server,  which  could  be  integrated  with  the  UCS)  is  used  to  decouple  the  event
the  subscription  management  and  event

communication  component  (subscribe).  In  general,  a  PubSub  service  provides  greater
scalability  and  a  more  flexible  configuration.  A  brief  overview  extracted  from  [XEP-0060]  is
provided  next  describing  some  basic  concepts  of  the  XMPP  PubSub  service,  namely  nodes
and  the  related  access  models.  Later,  additional  requirements  related  to  supporting  UCA
PubSub are defined.

XMPP  defines  two  types  of  publication  node,  Leaf  and  Collection.  These  are  described  in
Table C-4.

Table C-4: — PubSub Node Types

Node Type

Description

Leaf

A  node  that  contains  published  items  only.  It  is  NOT  a  container  for  other
nodes. This is the most common node type.

Collection

A node that contains nodes and/or other collections but no published items.
Collections make it possible to represent more sophisticated relationships
among nodes. For details, refer to [XEP-0248].

XMPP defined nodes can have access models as described in Table C-5. They are described
in order of most open to least open.

Table C-5: — PubSub Node Access Models

Access Model  Description

Open

Presence

Roster

Any  entity  may  subscribe  to  the  node  (i.e.,  without  the  necessity  for
subscription  approval)  and  any  entity  may  retrieve  items  from  the  node  (i.e.,
without  being  subscribed);  this  SHOULD  be  the  default  access  model  for
generic pubsub services.

Any  entity  with  a  subscription  of  type  "from"  or  "both"  may  subscribe  to  the
node  and  retrieve  items  from  the  node;  this  access  model  applies  mainly  to
instant messaging systems (see [RFC-6121]).

Any  entity  in  the  specified  roster  group(s)  may  subscribe  to  the  node  and
retrieve  items  from  the  node;  this  access  model  applies  mainly  to  instant
messaging systems (see [RFC-6121]).

Authorize

The  node  owner  must  approve  all  subscription
subscribers may retrieve items from the node.

requests,  and  only

Whitelist

An  entity  may  subscribe  or  retrieve  items  only  if  on  a  whitelist  managed  by
the  node owner.  The  node  owner  MUST  automatically be on the whitelist. In
order  to  add  entities  to  the  whitelist,  the  node  owner  SHOULD  use  the
protocol  specified  in  the  "Manage  Affiliated  Entities"  section  of  [XEP-0060],
specifically by setting the affiliation to "member".

The  access  model  is  assigned  by  the  node  owner  during  its  configuration.  Support  for  the
"owner"  and  "none"  affiliations  are  required  by  [XEP-0060].  Support  for  all  other  affiliations
(as  profiled  in  Table  C-6)  is  recommended.  For  each  non-required  affiliation  supported  by  an
implementation, it should return a service discovery feature of "name-affiliation" where "name"
is  the  name  of  the  affiliation,  such  as  "member",  "outcast",  or  "published.  Particular  kinds  of
PubSub services may enforce additional requirements (e.g., requiring support for a given non-
required  affiliation  or  for  all  affiliations).  UCA  defines  some  additional  general  principles  for
PubSub affiliations as described in C.7.6.

To  identify  the  PubSub  JID,  UCC-CPs  and  UCCDs  shall  be  capable  of  sending  a

features  as  described  in  [XEP-0030]  and  [XEP-0060].  Some  additional  requirements  are
related to disco# are also described in C.7.2. Note that a typical PubSub JID is of the form

21 Any  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  belonging  to  a  specific  user  account  shall  be  considered as  an  "owner"  for  subscription
and retrieval purposes to any PubSub node created by any UCCD or UCC-CP belonging to the same account.

22 Only the UCCD creating a PubSub node shall be considered the "owner" of the node for publication, deletion.

23 Note:  A  service  MAY  allow  any  publisher  to  delete  /  purge  any  item  once  it  has  been  published  to  that  node
instead of allowing only the original publisher to remove it. This behaviour is NOT RECOMMENDED for the publish-
only affiliation, which SHOULD be allowed to delete only items that the publish- only entity has published.
The ways in which an entity changes its affiliation with a node are well-defined. Typically, action by an owner is
required  to  make  an  affiliation  state  transition.  Affiliation  changes  and  their  triggering  actions  are  specified  in
Table C-7.

"pubsub." concatenated with the UCS JID, for example the PubSub service for "mycloud.org"
would be "pubsub.mycloud.org".

For  UCCDs  that  have  evented  state  variables,  cloud  eventing  proceeds  along  one  of  two
possible  phases  depending  on  whether  the  related  UCCD  PubSub  hierarchy  needs  to  be
created,  updated,  or  just  published  to.  First  the,  UCCD  needs  to  determine  if  the  PubSub
hierarchy exists for itself, and if it does, whether it conforms to the latest configuration.

If  the  hierarchy  does  not  exist  and  the  UCCD  has  evented  state  variables,  then  the  UCCD
creates it by:

•  Creating a UCCD collection node at the UCCDs PubSub service,
•  Creating a configIdCloud leaf node of the device collection  node  and adding to it an

item of value "CONFIGURING",

•  Creating service collection node(s) for each service in the UCCD and tying them to the

device collection node,

•  Creating  evented  state  variable  leaf  node(s)  for  each  evented  state  variable  and  tying

them to their service collection node.

•  Publishing, for each evented state variable, the current state as an item of the respective

event leaf node.

•  Changing the configIdCloud leaf node to the current version.
•  Once configured, the UCCD begins publishing all new events to the PubSub  collection.
Figure C-10 illustrates the related PubSub configuration flow.

If  the  hierarchy  does  exist  for  the  evented  state  variables,  but  the  UCCD  confirms  the
configIDCloud  leaf  node  is  not  up  to  date  then  it  ceases  any  further  event  publication  and
updates the configuration by:

•  changing the configIdCloud leaf node to "CONFIGURING",
•

traversing  each  branch  of  the  device  PubSub  hierarchy  and  purging  all  evented  state
variable item(s) of any evented state variable that the UCCD does not support in its new
configuration,

•  deleting any evented state variable leaf node no longer in a specific service and adding

any new evented state variable(s) as a new leaf node(s),

•  deleting any service collection node(s) (and first their event node(s) and event item(s)

no-longer supported by the UCCD,

•  creating any new service collection node(s) as described previously,
•  changing the configIdCloud node  to the current version.
•

resuming publication of events to the PubSub.

Else

•

 A UCCD continues to publish events to the PubSub.

For UCC-CPs there are essentially 4 phases involved:

•  A  UCC-CP  determines  the  expected  PubSub  structure  of  a  UCCD  from  the  UCCDs  full

JID and DDD/SCPD description.

•

If  the  examined  UCCD  has  evented  state  variables  then  a  UCC-CP  can  subscribe  to  the
PubSub service events (collection node(s) [XEP-0248] ) it needs to monitor.

•  A  UCC-CP  monitors  the  PubSub  service  for  events  indicating  a  change  (modification  in
the configIDCloud leaf  node) to the device description and re-subscribes if necessary.
•  A  UCC-CP  unsubscribe  to  events  (collection  node(s)  or  leaf  node(s))  it  no  longer

needs to monitor.

The  UCCD  shall  monitor  the  response  to  the  node  creation  stanzas  to  make  sure  that  each
node  is  created  successfully.  If  a  node  creation  fails  the  UCCD  should  re-try  the  creation.
The  UCCD  shall  not  publish  a  configIdCloud  leaf  node  (other  than  with  a  value  of
"CONFIGURING")  until  it  has  confirmed  that  the  complete  PubSub  event  structure  for  the
current UCCD has been configured.

A  UCCD  shall  be  parsimonious  with  any  updates  to  its  PubSub  collection  to  avoid
unnecessary  stanza  traffic  as  any  node  or  item  deletion  will  result  in  notifications  to  all
subscribed UCC-CPs. Therefore, a UCCD should only remove collection or event node(s)
that are no longer part of the current configuration. For example, a UCCD should not remove
the  ContentDirectory  service  collection  node  from  a  MediaServer  collection  node
since  it  is  required  for  all  MediaServers  or  a  SystemUpdateID  state  variable  event  node
since it is required for all ContentDirectory services.

PubSub  node  and  item  deletion  is  not  described  explicitly  in  the  UCA  but  all  UCCDs  and
UCSs  shall  support  node  and  item  deletion  as  described  in  [XEP-0060]  sections  "Delete  a
Node" and "Delete and Item from a Node" respectively; and shall use the  to and from stanza
addressing as described previously in this section.

In  a  newer  instance  of  the  MediaServer,  support  for  the  LastChange  state  variable  is
dropped.  After  first  publishing  a  "CONFIGURING"  state  to  the  configIdCloud  leaf  node,  the
UCCD deletes the state variable leaf node "LastChange" as follows:

UCCD:jeffrey@mycloud.org/urn:schemas-upnp-
org:device:MediaServer:4:uuid:e70e9d0e-d9eb-4748-b163-636a323e7950

          636a323e7950/ContentDirectory/LastChange"/>
   </pubsub>
</iq>

Once  the  UCCD  event  structure  is  updated  the  UCCD  also  updates  the  configIdCloud  leaf
node with the new value. Note that the UCCD will have already updated its presence with the
new configIDCloud value.

C.7.3

Publishing a UCCD PubSub event

When a UCCD events a state variable, it shall update the corresponding PubSub leaf node
by  sending  an  <iq>  stanza  to  its  UCC  PubSub  service  containing  the  publish  element  as
described in the following template.

Note  that  some  additional  considerations  for  special  case  events  may  be  needed,  such  as  a
ContentDirectory  service  LastChange  event;  in  these  cases,  a  specific  UCA  Annex  will  be
created to describe the support for the particular DCP.

Typically  the  PubSub  event  leaf  node  buffer  has  a  depth  of  1,  therefore  it  is
recommended that a PubSub retract  message not be sent (to save on bandwidth)
unless  an  event  buffer  specifically  defined  to  be  of  length  greater  than  1  has  been
configured.

UCC-CPs subscribed to the event (leaf node) or any corresponding  collection node will
receive  the  event  with  item  id  and  possible  payload  as  described  in  the  following  template
depending  whether  the  UCCD  configures  with  or  without  #deliver_payloads  set  and  the
item node is a leaf or collection type (see section 7 of [XEP-0060] for more detail).

each  subscription.  By  "entity"  here  is  meant  the  JID  specified  for  the  subscription,  whether
bare JID or full JID; however, if the same bare  JID  has multiple subscriptions but those
subscriptions are for different full JIDs (e.g., one subscription for user@domain.tld./foo and
another subscription for user@domain.tld/bar), the service shall treat those as separate JIDs
for the purpose of generating event notifications.

C.7.6

Permissions model

Principals of UCA PubSub permission models.

•  Personal Eventing Protocol is the preferred configuration.
•  PubSub leaf  and collection  node  ownership should  be restricted to the  full  JID  to

prevent cross posting of events between UCCDs and UCC-CPs or non-UCA JIDs.

•  The  access  model  for  UCCD  event  collection  and  leaf  nodes  should  be  of  type

"roster".

© 2015 Open Connectivity Foundation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

— 189 —

•  All UCCDs and UCC-CPs should be in the base <group/> named "UPnPCloud".
•  All  UCCDs  and  UCC-CPs

the  "UPnPCloud"  roster  <group/>  should  have
affliliations  with  the  event  collection  and  leaf  node(s)  associated  with  their
bare JID so that any event subscription can be auto accepted.

C.8  SOAP over XMPP (Analog of Control)

Like  UDA,  UCA  uses  SOAP  for  control  and  specifically  extends  the  SOAP  over  XMPP  as
described in [XEP-0072] 24.

A UCCD shall  be capable of receiving  and responding to an  invoked action using SOAP  over
XMPP as defined in [XEP-0072] and this specification.

A UCC-CP shall be capable of invoking an Action using SOAP over XMPP as defined in [XEP-
0072] and this specification.

To verify SOAP support at the XMPP level a UCC-CP can send an <iq> stanza containing an
<query xmlns=http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info"/> element to a UCCD. If
such  a  stanza  is  received  by  a  UCCD  and  no  error  conditions  are  encountered  the  UCCD
should include in its response <query> element sub-elements
<identity category="automation" type=”soap”/> and
<feature var="http://jabber.org/protocol/soap"/> element.

An example is shown below in the case where disco#info is used to indicate SOAP support.

SOAP  messages  are  exchanged  using  <iq>  stanzas  where  the  invoking  UCC-CP  sends  an
<iq> stanza with the iq@type attribute value of “set” with the service serviceId contained
in the header and the SOAP action contained in the body of the <iq> stanza as follows:

To  control  a  UCCD,  a  UCC-CP  shall  send  an  <iq>  stanza  as  de scribed  in  the  following
template.

24 Note  that  even  though [XEP-0072]  is  defined  for  SOAP  1.2  only  SOAP  1.1  is  required  for  UCA,  for  example,

SOAP 1.1 namespace is used as described in section 3:. Control.

Note, the messages are sent through the user’s UCS which is not shown in the exchanges.

C.9  Support for Binary (Media) Transport

No  specific  support  for  the  exchange  of  binary  data  is  required  at  this  time.  Any  additional
transport  (for  example  Audio-Video  media)  is  left  to  the  responsible  UPnP  Forum  Working
Committee  or  the  vendor.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  UPnP  Forum  Working  Committees
publish  a  UCA  Annex  to  their  existing  DCPs  and  SCPDs  to  integrate  UCA  into  the  existing
specifications.

Exchange  of  Base64  encoded  binary  within  XMPP  stanzas  as  a  regular  means  of
transport is highly discouraged, as this will likely result in significant UCS slowdown
and overall bad UCA experience for all UCCD and UCC-CPs.

C.10  UCA errorCodes

The following errorCodes are similar in structure and schema to those in Table 3-3 but are not
part  of  an  Action  error  and  instead  are  UCA  specific  errors  returned  as  part  of  <iq>  stanza
response.

ErrorCode
900

errorDescription
DeviceType mismatch

Description
The  resource  part  of  the  full  JID  of  the  "to"
device  does  not  match  the  DDD  of  the
device.

C.12  Closing a UCA Session

— 194 —

Often  a  UCCD  or  UCC-CP  will  need  to  completely  close  its  connection  with  its  UCS.  When
doing  so  it  will  first  issue  a  <presense>  stanza  of  type  "unavailable"  and  then  close  the
XMPP session using the steam close elements as shown below.

Note  that  this  closes  both  the  directional  streams:  UCCD  (or  UCC-CP)  to  UCS  and  UCS  to
UCCD (or UCC-CP).

<presence type="unavailable">

UCCD (or UCC-CP) closes its stream to UCS.

UCCD (or UCC-CP)->UCS
</stream:stream>

UCS closes its stream to UCCD (or UCC-CP)

UCS->UCCD (or UCC-CP)
</stream:stream>

Note,  that  until  the  </stream:stream>  element  is  received  by  the  UCS  the  UCS  will  consider
the  connection  open  for  a  limited  period,  even  if  the  underlying  TCP  connection  has  been
closed. When the XMPP clients have been idle or sleeping for a significant amount of time (as
determined by the UCS; most likely 30 minutes) or have been disconnected the UCS will send
a <presence> stanza of type "unavailable" on their behalf.

C.13  UCA over BOSH and WebSocket

From [XEP-0124],  BOSH "defines  a transport protocol  that emulates the  semantics  of  a  long-
lived,  bidirectional  TCP  connection  between  two  entities  (such  as  a  client  and  a  server)  by
efficiently  using  multiple  synchronous  HTTP request/response  pairs  without requiring  the  use
of frequent polling or chunked responses; thus allowing a browser based UCCD or UCC-CP to
connect  with  a  Webserver  based  UCS.  WebSocket  [RFC-6455]  offers  additional  advantages
over  BOSH  as  an  alternative  transport  and  its  usage  is  likely  to  become  more  widespread  in
the future. Therefore, BOSH and WebSocket support for UCA is defined as follows:

A UCS shall support BOSH [XEP-0124].

A UCCD or UCC-CP which contains a web browser should support BOSH [XEP-0124].

A UCS, UCCD or UCC-CP may support WebSocket [RFC-6455].

## Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) SUBSCRIBE can be abused to send traffic to arbitrary destinations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#339275

Original Release Date: 2020-06-08 | Last Revised: 2020-07-08

---

### Overview

The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol in effect prior to April 17, 2020 can be abused to send traffic to arbitrary destinations using the SUBSCRIBE functionality.

### Description

The UPnP protocol, as specified by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), is designed to provide automatic discovery and interaction with devices on a network. The UPnP protocol is designed to be used in a trusted local area network (LAN) and the protocol does not implement any form of authentication or verification.

Many common Internet-connected devices support UPnP, as noted in previous research from Daniel Garcia ([VU#357851](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/357851)) and [Rapid7](https://blog.rapid7.com/2013/01/29/security-flaws-in-universal-plug-and-play-unplug-dont-play/). Garcia presented at [DEFCON 2019](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Garcia/DEFCON-19-Garcia-UPnP-Mapping.pdf) and published a scanning and portmapping tool. The UPnP [Device Protection](https://upnp.org/specs/gw/UPnP-gw-DeviceProtection-v1-Service.pdf) service was not widely adopted.

A vulnerability in the UPnP SUBSCRIBE capability permits an attacker to send large amounts of data to arbitrary destinations accessible over the Internet, which could lead to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), data exfiltration, and other unexpected network behavior. The OCF has [updated the UPnP specification](https://openconnectivity.org/upnp-specs/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v2.0-20200417.pdf) to address this issue. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-12695 and is also known as [Call Stranger](https://callstranger.com).

Although offering UPnP services on the Internet is generally considered to be a [misconfiguration](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/357851/), a number of devices are still available over the Internet according to a [recent Shodan scan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=upnp).

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to abuse the UPnP SUBSCRIBE capability to send traffic to arbitrary destinations, leading to amplified DDoS attacks and data exfiltration. In general, making UPnP available over the the Internet can pose further security vulnerabilities than the one described in this vulnerability note.

### Solution

#### Affected devices

A number of devices have been identified as vulnerable by the security researcher and have been posted at the [CallStranger](https://callstranger.com) website. There is more information on affected devices in Tenable's blog on [cve-2020-12695](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2020-12695-callstranger-vulnerability-in-universal-plug-and-play-upnp-puts-billions-of).

#### Apply updates

Vendors are urged to implement the updated [specification](https://openconnectivity.org/upnp-specs/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v2.0-20200417.pdf) provided by the OCF.. Users should monitor vendor support channels for updates that implement the new SUBSCRIBE specification.

#### Disable or Restrict UPnP

Disable the UPnP protocol on Internet-accessible interfaces. Device manufacturers are urged to disable the UPnP SUBSCRIBE capability in their default configuration and to require users to explicitly enable SUBSCRIBE with any appropriate network restrictions to limit its usage to a trusted local area network.

#### IDS Signature

This Surricata IDS rule looks for any HTTP SUBSCRIBE request to what is likely to be an external network (i.e., not RFC1918 and RFC4193 addresses). Network administrators and ISPs can deploy this signature at the Internet access point to detect any anomalous SUBSCRIBE requests reaching their users.

`alert http any any -> ![fd00::/8,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12] any (msg:"UPnP SUBSCRIBE request seen to external network VU#339275: CVE-
2020-12695 https://kb.cert.org "; content: "subscribe"; nocase; http_method; sid:1367339275;)`

Lightweight UPnP client library for Python.

## Install

```
$ pip install upnpy

```

## Examples

#### Get the external IP address of an [Internet Gateway Device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol):

```
import upnpy

upnp = upnpy.UPnP()

# Discover UPnP devices on the network
# Returns a list of devices e.g.: [Device <Broadcom ADSL Router>]
devices = upnp.discover()

# Select the IGD
# alternatively you can select the device directly from the list
# device = devices[0]
device = upnp.get_igd()

# Get the services available for this device
# Returns a list of services available for the device
# e.g.: [<Service (WANPPPConnection) id="WANPPPConnection.1">, ...]
device.get_services()

# We can now access a specific service on the device by its ID
# The IDs for the services in this case contain illegal values so we can't access it by an attribute
# If the service ID didn't contain illegal values we could access it via an attribute like this:
# service = device.WANPPPConnection

# We will access it like a dictionary instead:
service = device['WANPPPConnection.1']

# Get the actions available for the service
# Returns a list of actions for the service:
#   [<Action name="SetConnectionType">,
#   <Action name="GetConnectionTypeInfo">,
#   <Action name="RequestConnection">,
#   <Action name="ForceTermination">,
#   <Action name="GetStatusInfo">,
#   <Action name="GetNATRSIPStatus">,
#   <Action name="GetGenericPortMappingEntry">,
#   <Action name="GetSpecificPortMappingEntry">,
#   <Action name="AddPortMapping">,
#   <Action name="DeletePortMapping">,
#   <Action name="GetExternalIPAddress">]
service.get_actions()

# Finally, get the external IP address
# Execute the action by its name
# Returns a dictionary: {'NewExternalIPAddress': 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'}
service.GetExternalIPAddress()
```

#### Add a new port mapping to an [Internet Gateway Device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol):

```
import upnpy

upnp = upnpy.UPnP()

# Discover UPnP devices on the network
# Returns a list of devices e.g.: [Device <Broadcom ADSL Router>]
devices = upnp.discover()

# Select the IGD
# alternatively you can select the device directly from the list
# device = devices[0]
device = upnp.get_igd()

# Get the services available for this device
# Returns a list of services available for the device
# e.g.: [<Service (WANPPPConnection) id="WANPPPConnection.1">, ...]
device.get_services()

# We can now access a specific service on the device by its ID
# The IDs for the services in this case contain illegal values so we can't access it by an attribute
# If the service ID didn't contain illegal values we could access it via an attribute like this:
# service = device.WANPPPConnection

# We will access it like a dictionary instead:
service = device['WANPPPConnection.1']

# Get the actions available for the service
# Returns a list of actions for the service:
#   [<Action name="SetConnectionType">,
#   <Action name="GetConnectionTypeInfo">,
#   <Action name="RequestConnection">,
#   <Action name="ForceTermination">,
#   <Action name="GetStatusInfo">,
#   <Action name="GetNATRSIPStatus">,
#   <Action name="GetGenericPortMappingEntry">,
#   <Action name="GetSpecificPortMappingEntry">,
#   <Action name="AddPortMapping">,
#   <Action name="DeletePortMapping">,
#   <Action name="GetExternalIPAddress">]
service.get_actions()

# The action we are looking for is the "AddPortMapping" action
# Lets see what arguments the action accepts
# Use the get_input_arguments() or get_output_arguments() method of the action
# for a list of input / output arguments.
# Example output of the get_input_arguments method for the "AddPortMapping" action
# Returns a dictionary:
# [
#     {
#         "name": "NewRemoteHost",
#         "data_type": "string",
#         "allowed_value_list": []
#     },
#     {
#         "name": "NewExternalPort",
#         "data_type": "ui2",
#         "allowed_value_list": []
#     },
#     {
#         "name": "NewProtocol",
#         "data_type": "string",
#         "allowed_value_list": [
#             "TCP",
#             "UDP"
#         ]
#     },
#     {
#         "name": "NewInternalPort",
#         "data_type": "ui2",
#         "allowed_value_list": []
#     },
#     {
#         "name": "NewInternalClient",
#         "data_type": "string",
#         "allowed_value_list": []
#     },
#     {
#         "name": "NewEnabled",
#         "data_type": "boolean",
#         "allowed_value_list": []
#     },

#         "data_type": "ui4",
#         "allowed_value_list": []
#     }
# ]
service.AddPortMapping.get_input_arguments()

# Finally, add the new port mapping to the IGD
# This specific action returns an empty dict: {}
service.AddPortMapping(
    NewRemoteHost='',
    NewExternalPort=80,
    NewProtocol='TCP',
    NewInternalPort=8000,
    NewInternalClient='192.168.1.3',

Package        : wpa
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12695 CVE-2021-0326 CVE-2021-27803
Debian Bug     : 976106 981971

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in wpa_supplicant and
hostapd.

CVE-2020-12695

    It was discovered that hostapd does not properly handle UPnP
    subscribe messages under certain conditions, allowing an attacker to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-0326

    It was discovered that wpa_supplicant does not properly process P2P
    (Wi-Fi Direct) group information from active group owners. An
    attacker within radio range of the device running P2P could take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
    execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-27803

    It was discovered that wpa_supplicant does not properly process
    P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) provision discovery requests. An attacker
    within radio range of the device running P2P could take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially execute
    arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u3.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-06-10 14:54:17 UTC  ``` The Open Connectivity Foundation UPnP specification before 2020-04-17 does not forbid the acceptance of a subscription request with a delivery URL on a different network segment than the fully qualified event-subscription URL, aka the CallStranger issue.  References: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/08/2> <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/339275> <https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger> <https://www.callstranger.com>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-06-10 14:54:38 UTC  ``` Created hostapd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1846008](show_bug.cgi?id=1846008 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-12695 hostapd: UPnP SUBSCRIBE misbehavior in WPS AP [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1846007](show_bug.cgi?id=1846007 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-12695 hostapd: UPnP SUBSCRIBE misbehavior in WPS AP [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c2)  Todd Cullum    2020-06-11 18:17:08 UTC  ``` General Flaw summary: Devices host UPnP servers in order to supply information to UPnP clients and allow them to send commands to the UPnP server. For example, a device (such as a printer, camera, or video game console) running a UPnP client can send an HTTP request of method M-SEARCH over UDP to the broadcast IP. This will cause UPnP servers on the network to reply with device information such as make, model, services offered, and URLs where commands can be sent to the server for further actions. UPnP also allows the client application to send an HTTP request of method SUBSCRIBE. This request allows the client to subscribe to events. In the SUBSCRIBE request, the client supplies a CALLBACK URL, which is where the server needs to send event notifications, in the form of NOTIFY requests back to the client. In fact, the specification allows for an unlimited number of URLs to be supplied as the CALLBACK URL. If a reply is not received from the first URL, the server moves to the second, third, and so on... Knowing this, the CallStranger flaw leverages:  1. When subscribing to UPnP-enabled device server events, a callback URL is supplied by the client to the server. 2. This URL is not limited in length by the UPnP specification 3. Unlimited number of URLs can be supplied in succession. 4. If TCP ports are closed at the current URL, the server will send n number of TCP SYN packets to keep trying for a while* 5. After multiple failures to connect, the server will again try this at the next URL. This allows for attempts on arbitrary many URLs/HTTPservers** 6. There is also no limitation on the data supplied in the callback URL. E.G. 127.0.0.1:port/unlimiteddatahere . This can be used to put excessive load on bandwidth and the server, as well as slam another service with lots of data. 7. The final feature is that the UPnP specification allowed these callback URL requests to be sent to hosts outside of the network, meaning that a UPnP client that is inside a local network could force a UPnP server in that network to send data outside of the network, which could be used to exfiltrate data and/or perform a DDoS attack in, e.g. a botnet. This could be accomplished if a client specified the callback URL as some resource on the Internet, for example.  * This also allows for SYN flooding. The exact number of SYN packets sent depends on OS and specific machine configurations.  ** This can be leveraged to perform a port scan because an attacker knows that a port is open if no request is made to a subsequent URL in the CALLBACK url list.  Thus, the flaw could allow for DoS/DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and port scanning. It should also be noted that there are numerous UPnP servers which listen on the Internet, instead of just on local networks, allowing for SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests to be negotiated from/to outside the network.  Although the UPnP specification allowed the vectors mentioned above, there are other mitigations that can be put in place to prevent exploitation of this flaw, that we will list under the Mitigations heading. On April 17, 2020, the UPnP specification was updated[1] with:  "The subscription request containing a delivery URL not on the same network segment as the fully qualified event subscription URL shall not be accepted."  1. <http://openconnectivity.org/developer/specifications/upnp-resources/upnp/#architectural>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c4)  Todd Cullum    2020-06-11 21:58:12 UTC  ``` The wpa_supplicant build configuration does not build with CONFIG_WPS_UPNP=y or CONFIG_WPS_ER=y in RHEL 5, 6, 7, or 8. Thus the UPnP functionality is not enabled as shipped.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-06-11 23:20:25 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-12695>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c7)  Todd Cullum    2020-06-12 01:34:13 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To mitigate this flaw, close off the UPnP UDP port (usually 1900) and UPnP service ports from the Internet using a firewall. It's important to note that UPnP service ports vary based on the device, so device documentation should be consulted. Do not expose UPnP servers to the Internet. Exploitation of this flaw relies on HTTP SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests, which can be blocked using a network security appliance, as another mitigation option.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c11)  Todd Cullum    2020-06-19 17:23:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw does not affect the wpa_supplicant package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and 8. wpa_supplicant's WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) External Registrar functionality, which uses UPnP to act as a registrar for a WiFi access point, and hostapd's WPS UPnP functionality, are disabled in the build configuration. Additionally, wpa_supplicant's P2P functionality does not support UPnP as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and 8.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1846006#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-05-18 14:34:04 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Zeek Package that detects CallStranger (CVE-2020-12695) attempts (<http://callstranger.com/>)

This package attempts to detect CallStranger (CVE-2020-12695) exploitation attempts and data exfiltration. It does so by looking for three key things:

1. UPnP `SUBSCRIBE` commands with a Notify URL that contains an IP address that isn't an RFC1918 or local\_nets address. This could be the precursor for DDoS amplification or Data Exfiltration
2. UPnP `NOTIFY` commands that are destined for a non-RFC1918 or local\_nets address. This could indicate active DDoS amplification or Data Exfiltration
3. UPnP `SUBSCRIBE` commands with a Notify URL that is longer than `CallStrangerDetector::exfiltration_threshold` bytes. This could indicate data exfiltration over UPnP

The module assumes that your site doesn't normally have UPnP `SUBSCRIBE` or `NOTIFY` commands destined for the Internet and that you don't have UPnP devices exposed to the Internet. If either of these things are true, you will see false positives. You can add particular IPs that create false positives to the `CallStrangerDetector::ignore_subnets` set to ignore them.

## Usage

### Standalone Mode

To use this script against a PCAP, simply clone the Git repository and run Zeek with `zeek -Cr your.pcap scripts/__load__.zeek`

### As a Package

To install the package, clone the Git repository and execute `zkg install .` from the package directory

## Notice Types

The module will add notices to `notice.log` if it detects CallStranger-like activity. The notices are as follows:

* `CallStranger_Data_Exfiltration_Attempt`: Observed an attempt to have a UPnP device exfiltrate traffic
* `CallStranger_Data_Exfiltration_Success`: Observed a UPnP device likely exfiltrating data
* `CallStranger_UPnP_Request_Callback_To_External_Host`: Observed an attempt to have a UPnP device call back to an external host
* `CallStranger_UPnP_To_External_Host`: Observed a UPnP device calling back to an external host

## Configuration Options

There are three configuration options that you can set:

* `CallStrangerDetector::exfiltration_threshold`: The number of bytes that need to be observed in a UPnP Callback URL in order to be classified as data exfiltration.
* `CallStrangerDetector::ignore_subnets`: A set of subnets that should be ignored for UPnP detections. Use this if you have false positives where UPnP is traversing the Internet legitimately.
* `CallStrangerDetector::strict_upnp_protocol_detection`: This boolean controls whether the script will be more strict when trying to identify UPnP SUBSCRIBE commands. It does so by requiring the “NT” (Notification Type) header to be observed. The default is false because the NT header doesn’t actually do anything, it’s just required by the UPnP specification. If you have non-UPnP SUBSCRIBE traffic, you may have to set this to true

## Disclaimer

I have tested this against local UPnP traffic and by using the proof of concept code provided by the CallStranger author (<https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger>). If you have any issues, please open a GitHub issue or contact us. Thanks!

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : gupnp
Version        : 1.0.1-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12695

Yunus Çadırcı found an issue in the SUBSCRIBE method of UPnP, a
network protocol for devices to automatically discover and communicate
with each other. Insuficient checks on this method allowed attackers
to use vulnerable UPnP services for DoS attacks or possibly to bypass
firewalls.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.0.1-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gupnp packages.

For the detailed security status of gupnp please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/gupnp>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: hostapd: UPnP SUBSCRIBE misbehavior in hostapd WPS AP

Published: June 8, 2020
Identifiers:
- VU#339275 and CVE-2020-12695 (applying for the callback URL in other
  network case, but not the other items discussed in this advisory)
Latest version available from: <https://w1.fi/security/2020-1/>

Vulnerability

General security vulnerability in the way the callback URLs in the UPnP
SUBSCRIBE command are used were reported (VU#339275, CVE-2020-12695).
Some of the described issues may be applicable to the use of UPnP in WPS
AP mode functionality for supporting external registrars.

Such issues could allow a device connected to the local network (i.e., a
device that has been authorized to transmit packets in the network in
which the AP is located) could trigger the AP to initiate a HTTP
(TCP/IP) connection to an arbitrary URL, including connections to
servers in external networks. This could have a security implication if
traffic from the local network to external destinations have different
rules (e.g., firewall and packet inspection) for different local hosts
and the AP having access to external hosts while the attacker controlled
local device not having such access. Such deployment cases may not be
common for networks where WPS would be enabled, but it is not possible
to completely rule out the applicability to cases where hostapd is used
to control a WPS enabled AP.

In addition to the more generic issues with the UPnP protocol, couple of
implementation specific issues in hostapd were discovered while
reviewing this area of the WPS implementation. These issues could allow
local devices (i.e., devices that have been authorized to transmit
packets in the network in which the AP is located) to trigger
misbehavior in hostapd and cause the process to either get terminated or
to start using more CPU resources by using a specially constructed
SUBSCRIBE command.

All these issues require the attacker to be able to discover the UPnP
service provided by hostapd and to open a TCP connection toward the IP
address of the AP. The former requires access to the local network to be
able to receive broadcast packets and the latter requires access to
initiate TCP/IP connection to the IP address used by the AP. In most
common AP deployment cases, both of these operations are available only
from the local network.

Vulnerable versions/configurations

All hostapd versions with WPS AP support with UPnP enabled in the build
parameters (CONFIG_WPS_UPNP=y) and in the runtime configuration
(upnp_iface).

Possible mitigation steps

- Disable WPS UPnP support in the hostapd runtime configuration by
  removing the upnp_iface parameter.

- Merge the following commits to hostapd and rebuild:

  For CVE-2020-12695:
  WPS UPnP: Do not allow event subscriptions with URLs to other networks
  For the other issues:
  WPS UPnP: Fix event message generation using a long URL path
  WPS UPnP: Handle HTTP initiation failures for events more properly

  These patches are available from <https://w1.fi/security/2020-1/>

- Update to hostapd v2.10 or newer, once available

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), a ubiquitous protocol used by “billions of devices,” may be vulnerable to data exfiltration and reflected amplified TCP distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

### Background

On June 8, researcher [Yunus Çadirci](https://twitter.com/yunuscadirci?lang=en) published an advisory for [CallStranger](https://callstranger.com/), a vulnerability in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. UPnP is currently managed by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF). As its name implies, UPnP is a protocol designed to allow a variety of networked devices to universally communicate with each other without any special setup or configuration.

Because of its ubiquitous nature, UPnP is used by a wide variety of devices, including personal computers, networking equipment, video game consoles and internet of things (IoT) devices such as smart televisions. As a result, Çadirci says this particular vulnerability potentially affects “billions of devices.”

### Analysis

[CVE-2020-12695](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-12695) is a server-side request forgery (SSRF)-like vulnerability in devices that utilize UPnP. The vulnerability exists due to the ability to control the Callback header value in the UPnP SUBSCRIBE function.

![CVE-2020-12695: CallStranger Vulnerability in Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Puts Billions of Devices At Risk](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/CVE-2020-12695%20-%20CallStranger%20Vulnerability.png)![]()

Source: [CallStranger Technical Report](https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger/blob/master/CallStranger%20-%20Technical%20Report.pdf)

The SUBSCRIBE function is part of the UPnP standard that allows devices to monitor changes in other devices and services. For example, the [PoC published on GitHub](https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger) shows port 2869 for Microsoft’s Xbox One — which is used to monitor device changes on the network for features like media sharing — as vulnerable.

In order to exploit the flaw, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted HTTP SUBSCRIBE request to a vulnerable device.

An attacker could utilize this vulnerability in the following scenarios:

* Intranet device port scanning to gather additional data from trusted assets within an organization’s LAN, bypassing organizational Data Loss Prevention (DLP) standards.
* [Send large amounts of traffic to arbitrary destinations](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/339275). Targets flooded by the affected devices could crash under the increased network load, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This is a result of UPnP attempting to establish a TCP handshake with multiple SYN packets for all Callback values in the SUBSCRIBE request.
* Exfiltrate sensitive device data by directing callback information to arbitrary targets.

With the exception of the DoS, these scenarios provide a stealthy method for an attacker to steal data from a compromised network. This sensitive information could potentially open up an organization to further attack.

### Proof of concept

The original proof of concept (PoC) created by Çadirci has been added to his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger).

### Solution

Since CallStranger is a protocol-level vulnerability, OCF has made changes to the UPnP protocol specification. Therefore, manufacturers of affected devices are in the process of determining its impact. As a result, we anticipate newly affected devices will be reported and patches will be released over time for devices still receiving product support. Tenable product coverage for this vulnerability can be found in the “identifying affected systems” section below.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) SUBSCRIBE can be abused to send traffic to arbitrary destinations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#339275

Original Release Date: 2020-06-08 | Last Revised: 2020-07-08

---

### Overview

The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol in effect prior to April 17, 2020 can be abused to send traffic to arbitrary destinations using the SUBSCRIBE functionality.

### Description

The UPnP protocol, as specified by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), is designed to provide automatic discovery and interaction with devices on a network. The UPnP protocol is designed to be used in a trusted local area network (LAN) and the protocol does not implement any form of authentication or verification.

Many common Internet-connected devices support UPnP, as noted in previous research from Daniel Garcia ([VU#357851](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/357851)) and [Rapid7](https://blog.rapid7.com/2013/01/29/security-flaws-in-universal-plug-and-play-unplug-dont-play/). Garcia presented at [DEFCON 2019](https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-19/dc-19-presentations/Garcia/DEFCON-19-Garcia-UPnP-Mapping.pdf) and published a scanning and portmapping tool. The UPnP [Device Protection](https://upnp.org/specs/gw/UPnP-gw-DeviceProtection-v1-Service.pdf) service was not widely adopted.

A vulnerability in the UPnP SUBSCRIBE capability permits an attacker to send large amounts of data to arbitrary destinations accessible over the Internet, which could lead to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), data exfiltration, and other unexpected network behavior. The OCF has [updated the UPnP specification](https://openconnectivity.org/upnp-specs/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v2.0-20200417.pdf) to address this issue. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-12695 and is also known as [Call Stranger](https://callstranger.com).

Although offering UPnP services on the Internet is generally considered to be a [misconfiguration](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/357851/), a number of devices are still available over the Internet according to a [recent Shodan scan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=upnp).

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to abuse the UPnP SUBSCRIBE capability to send traffic to arbitrary destinations, leading to amplified DDoS attacks and data exfiltration. In general, making UPnP available over the the Internet can pose further security vulnerabilities than the one described in this vulnerability note.

### Solution

#### Affected devices

A number of devices have been identified as vulnerable by the security researcher and have been posted at the [CallStranger](https://callstranger.com) website. There is more information on affected devices in Tenable's blog on [cve-2020-12695](https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2020-12695-callstranger-vulnerability-in-universal-plug-and-play-upnp-puts-billions-of).

#### Apply updates

Vendors are urged to implement the updated [specification](https://openconnectivity.org/upnp-specs/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v2.0-20200417.pdf) provided by the OCF.. Users should monitor vendor support channels for updates that implement the new SUBSCRIBE specification.

#### Disable or Restrict UPnP

Disable the UPnP protocol on Internet-accessible interfaces. Device manufacturers are urged to disable the UPnP SUBSCRIBE capability in their default configuration and to require users to explicitly enable SUBSCRIBE with any appropriate network restrictions to limit its usage to a trusted local area network.

#### IDS Signature

This Surricata IDS rule looks for any HTTP SUBSCRIBE request to what is likely to be an external network (i.e., not RFC1918 and RFC4193 addresses). Network administrators and ISPs can deploy this signature at the Internet access point to detect any anomalous SUBSCRIBE requests reaching their users.

`alert http any any -> ![fd00::/8,192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12] any (msg:"UPnP SUBSCRIBE request seen to external network VU#339275: CVE-
2020-12695 https://kb.cert.org "; content: "subscribe"; nocase; http_method; sid:1367339275;)`
