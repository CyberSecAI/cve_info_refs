{
  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-12695",
    "Description": "The Open Connectivity Foundation UPnP specification before 2020-04-17 does not forbid the acceptance of a subscription request with a delivery URL on a different network segment than the fully qualified event-subscription URL, aka the CallStranger issue.",
    "Root cause": "Missing input validation in minidlna, a lightweight DLNA/UPnP-AV server, and improper handling of the callback URL in the UPnP SUBSCRIBE function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation",
      "Unrestricted callback URL in UPnP SUBSCRIBE"
    ],
    "Impact": "Execution of arbitrary code, data exfiltration, denial of service (DoS), distributed denial of service (DDoS), and internal port scanning.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious crafted UPnP SUBSCRIBE requests",
      "Abuse of UPnP services exposed to the Internet"
    ],
    "Attacker capabilities": [
      "Remote, unauthenticated attacker",
	  "Attacker within radio range of the device running P2P"
    ],
    "Official Description": "The Open Connectivity Foundation UPnP specification before 2020-04-17 does not forbid the acceptance of a subscription request with a delivery URL on a different network segment than the fully qualified event-subscription URL, aka the CallStranger issue."
  },
  "Additional_details": {
    "CallStranger": "The vulnerability is referred to as CallStranger",
     "UPnP_callback_header": "The vulnerability is caused by the Callback header value in the UPnP SUBSCRIBE function being controllable by an attacker, which enables an SSRF-like vulnerability.",
    "Minidlna": "Missing input validation in minidlna can result in the execution of arbitrary code.",
     "CallStranger_impact": "The vulnerability can be used to exfiltrate data, scan networks, or cause networks to participate in a DDoS attack.",
    "CallStranger_remediation": "The OCF updated the UPnP specification to remediate this vulnerability, vendors to provide patches.",
   "GUPnP_incorrect_handling": "GUPnP incorrectly handled certain subscription requests, which could allow a remote attacker to exfiltrate data or perform DDoS attacks."
