Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12652:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content from `www.debian.org`, `git.kernel.org`, `lists.debian.org`, `lists.opensuse.org` and `www.suse.com`  explicitly mentions CVE-2020-12652. 
   - The description from `git.kernel.org` precisely describes the vulnerability in the mptfusion driver, which aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a double fetch issue in the `mptfusion` storage driver's ioctl handler.  The driver fetches a parameter from user memory, and then, within called functions, performs a second `copy_from_user()` using the same user-provided data.
   - **Weakness:**
     - **Race Condition:** This double fetch creates a race condition. If the user-provided memory changes between the first and second fetches, the second fetch might use stale data, including an incorrect `iocp` pointer (used for locking), leading to incorrect lock usage.
     - **Incorrect Locking:** This can result in holding the incorrect lock and thus creating a race condition when accessing internal data structures.
   - **Impact:**
     - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The race condition can potentially lead to a crash or memory corruption, causing a denial of service.
     - **Privilege Escalation:**  There is also a possibility of privilege escalation due to the corrupted locking mechanisms.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Local user access to the `/dev/mptctl` device, which requires specific privileges.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - Local user privileges to access `/dev/mptctl`.
      - Ability to trigger the vulnerable ioctl handler.
      - Ability to modify the user-space memory during the double fetch.

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions**

   - The `git.kernel.org` content provides a code snippet showing the vulnerable double fetch pattern in the `mptctl.c` file, which is the `mptctl_fw_download()` or `mptctl_mpt_command()` function call based on `cmd` argument after locking.
   - The fix involves passing the `iocp` pointer directly to the called functions to avoid the second lookup. This not only fixes the vulnerability but also simplifies the code by removing redundant lookups.

**4. Additional Notes**
  - Some of the content states that the vulnerability is not as critical because access to `/dev/mptctl` usually requires root privileges. Although root has many destructive abilities, the patch is still considered important to fix the underlying race condition.
  - Several different vendors acknowledge this vulnerability in their products, showing it's a common issue.

In summary, CVE-2020-12652 arises from a double-fetch vulnerability in the mptfusion driver, leading to potential DoS or privilege escalation due to incorrect locking during ioctl operations. The vulnerability is exploitable by local users with specific device permissions. The fix involves eliminating the double fetch and passing the `iocp` pointer explicitly.
