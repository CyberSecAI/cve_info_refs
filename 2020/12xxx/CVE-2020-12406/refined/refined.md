### CVE-2020-12406
Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a type confusion vulnerability in Mozilla's JavaScript engine.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A missing type check during the removal of unboxed objects in the JavaScript engine. Specifically, it occurs in the `GetOwnPropertyPure` function where an object isn't checked to ensure it is a `NativeObject` before being cast to one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Type confusion due to the missing type check, leading to a crash when an unexpected type is encountered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A crash, and potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker is able to gain control of the execution flow of the program.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the vulnerable JavaScript code by visiting a specially crafted website or by other means of executing malicious JavaScript code.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of objects during unboxing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft or inject JavaScript code that triggers the missing type check when calling `GetOwnPropertyPure`.
- No specific user interaction other than visiting a malicious webpage.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by a Mozilla developer while analyzing the code, not based on a failing test case.
- The vulnerability is related to the removal of "unboxed objects" feature which was available in nightly builds.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox 77, 78, and ESR 68.9.

### Additional Notes:
The provided information also confirms the fix was applied in Firefox 77 and ESR 68.9. The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4421-1) mentions this CVE as a vulnerability fixed in Thunderbird as well.
