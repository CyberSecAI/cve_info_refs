## Description

![@bstapes](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20693610?v=4&size=48)[bstapes](https://github.com/bstapes)opened [on Apr 2, 2020](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/issues/2761#issue-592750440)

Teampass includes a feature to restrict the source IP address users can use to interact with Teampass. The value of the source IP address is [defined](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/blob/b9cf22a78b6bb63346d7e593bc984d56316ed772/api/functions.php#L33) from the first value in the X-Forwarded-For header in the client request.

Due to the fact that the client controls the X-Forwarded-For header and can set it to any value of their choosing, this header can be set to a whitelisted value which allows any client that can guess a whitelisted IP address to interact with Teampass from wherever they like.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Add 1.1.1.1 to the list of API IP Addresses allowed
2. Make an API call with an appropriate X-Forwarded-For header and notice that the call is valid

`curl -v -H "X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1" http://localhost/teampass/api/index.php/info/version/?apikey=xyz`

**Steps to fix**

* No data in headers provided by the client can be trusted, including X-Forwarded-For.
* The only reliable data about a client IP address is in the Source Address field in a TCP packet ([details](https://www.freesoft.org/CIE/Course/Section4/8.htm)).
