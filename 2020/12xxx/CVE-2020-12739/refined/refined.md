Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a generic denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability present in the Fanuc i Series CNC's embedded Ethernet functionality. The specific technical details are not provided in the documents, and require a login to access on the vendor's site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) issue. This falls under CWE-400, which refers to "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption". The documents don't provide specifics about the nature of the resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the CNC unavailable.
- The attack can block access to other devices that are connected to the same network, potentially disrupting a larger network of connected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A), which means the attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the CNC.
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network segment as the vulnerable CNC.
- No special privileges (PR:N) are required.
- No user interaction (UI:N) is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects a range of FANUC i Series CNC models, specifically those with embedded Ethernet 658M, 658A, 656E, 658E, 656V, 656A, and 656B series.
- The vendor, FANUC, has released updates/patches to address the vulnerability, available through their member's site.
- A workaround is to set up a firewall and restrict network access to the devices.
- The vulnerability was reported by Industrial Control Security Laboratory of Qi An Xin Technology Group Inc. from China.
