Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper protection of certain directories within the iTop application when deployed on IIS (Internet Information Services). Specifically, the embedded `web.config` files, which are intended to restrict web access to sensitive directories, do not cover all directories that should be forbidden.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is that web users can access directories that should be restricted, potentially exposing sensitive information or configuration data.
- **Missing web.config protections:** The `web.config` files in the affected versions of iTop do not have configurations that deny access to all necessary directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive files and directories (e.g., `conf`, `data`, `lib`, `log`) which may contain configuration details, database credentials, or other sensitive information.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Access to these files could allow an attacker to gain deeper access to the system by using exposed credentials or configuration details to further compromise the application or infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Web Access:** An attacker can directly request files in the vulnerable directories via HTTP/HTTPS. Due to the missing configurations in web.config, web server would serve the files.
- **Web Application:** Exploitation occurs through direct interaction with the web application via HTTP requests targeting the insufficiently protected directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the iTop application.
- **No Authentication Required (Initially):** The attack doesn't require prior authentication to the application. It involves accessing specific directories directly through web requests.

**Affected Versions:**
- iTop versions prior to 2.7.1 and 3.0.0 are affected.

**Patched Versions:**
- iTop versions 2.7.1 and 3.0.0 include fixes for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to iTop deployments using IIS.
- The provided content also includes information on other security best practices for iTop, such as securing critical directories using web server configurations, use of HTTPS, preventing session theft, and use of HTTP headers for added security.
- The provided content also includes github terms of service and other information unrelated to the specific vulnerability.
