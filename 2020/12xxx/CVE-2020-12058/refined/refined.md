Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2020-12058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user input before it is reflected in the response webpage. Specifically, the `tep_href_link()` function removes quotes from user input, but this is inadequate because the input is reflected inside Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The insufficient sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.  The attacker can bypass the quote removal by terminating the quote with the HTML entity `&quot;`, enabling the injection of code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This could lead to:
    - **Data theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    - **Account hijacking:** Potentially gaining control of user accounts.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the content of the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through manipulation of the `page`, `zpage`, or `spage` parameters in the URL. An attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in one of these parameters. When a victim clicks the crafted link, the server reflects the malicious payload, executing the injected javascript in the victimâ€™s browser

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. They do not require any access to the server and can be a remote user. They need to entice a user to click the malicious URL.
- The attacker can be unauthenticated.
- The vulnerability occurs in the admin panel of OsCommerce CEPhoenix.

**Vulnerable files/parameters:**

-The following pages and parameters are vulnerable:

  - `page` parameter:
    - `catalog/admin/order_status.php`
    - `catalog/admin/tax_rates.php`
    - `catalog/admin/languages.php`
    - `catalog/admin/countries.php`
    - `catalog/admin/tax_classes.php`
    - `catalog/admin/reviews.php`
    - `catalog/admin/currencies.php`
    - `catalog/admin/zones.php`
  - `zpage` and `spage` parameter:
    - `catalog/admin/geo_zones.php`

**Additional Notes:**

-The provided GitHub commit `8d0fb97810bc28880415a3a31607f473bfc5fec8` shows the fix for this vulnerability by casting the page parameter to an integer in the `tep_href_link()` function calls.
- The vulnerability was discovered automatically by the NAVEX project.
- The affected version of OsCommerce CEPhoenix is up to 1.0.6.0.
