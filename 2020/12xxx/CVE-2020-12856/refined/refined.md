    "match": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the Android version of the COVIDSafe app (v1.0.17 and earlier) and other similar contact tracing apps, where the bonding process with a peripheral device doesn't require user consent. This is due to the app's design, which performs GATT connection as a central and reads a characteristic, triggering silent bonding.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Silent bonding with an Android phone due to a lack of user confirmation during the bonding process when a GATT connection is made and a characteristic is read.",
        "Exchange of permanent identifiers (bluetooth device identity address and Identity Resolving Key - IRK) during the silent bonding process."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can obtain the victim's permanent identifiers, specifically the bluetooth device identity address and Identity Resolving Key (IRK), which can be used for long-term tracking of the phone.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker sets up a malicious Bluetooth device acting as a GATT server.",
        "The attacker uses a custom script to advertise a specific GATT service.",
         "A vulnerable app connects to the malicious server and reads a characteristic, triggering silent bonding."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the victim's phone and have the ability to run code (e.g., Python) to create a GATT server advertising the specific service."
