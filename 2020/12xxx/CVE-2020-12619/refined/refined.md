{
  "CVE-2020-12619": {
    "Root cause": "Proprietary mailto parameters implemented by various email clients to attach files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Email clients support non-standard mailto URI parameters to attach local files.",
      "This allows exfiltration of arbitrary files on disk."
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can create specially crafted mailto URIs that force the inclusion of arbitrary files, such as the OpenPGP private key, into an email sent back to the attacker. This can be done without the user noticing, or by obfuscating the attached file. Exfiltrated PGP private keys can be used to decrypt encrypted email or to impersonate the user.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted mailto URIs, often embedded in web pages or PDF documents, are used to initiate an email composition with a local file as attachment.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger mailto URIs to be processed by the victim's email client. This can be achieved through malicious websites, PDF documents, or by having passive MitM access to the victim's email drafts. The victim must send the email back to the attacker."
