  "CVE-2020-12244": {
    "Root cause": "Improper validation of records in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN response lacking an SOA in `SyncRes::processAnswer`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of DNSSEC signatures",
      "Incorrect handling of records in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN response"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position can bypass DNSSEC validation and send a NXDOMAIN answer for a name that does exist, leading to denial of existence spoofing.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position to inject malicious DNS responses."
