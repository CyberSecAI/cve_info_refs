- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the code used to configure the internal gateway firewall when the gateway's VLAN feature is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284). When the VLAN setting is enabled, the internal gateway firewall is disabled, exposing all ports used by the gateway.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can disable the internal gateway firewall. Once disabled, a malicious user can send specific commands to the gateway, which could then be forwarded to end-user wireless devices. This could lead to a compromise of the devices on the network and potential disruption of operations.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, and it can be exploited with a low skill level. An attacker would need network access to the affected gateway.
