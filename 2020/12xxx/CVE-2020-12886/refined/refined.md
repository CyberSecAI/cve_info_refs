  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2020-12886",
    "description": "A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP packet header starting from the message token. The length of the token in the received message is provided in the first byte parsed by the sn_coap_parser_options_parse() function. The length encoded in the message is not validated against the actual input buffer length before accessing the token. As a result, memory access outside of the intended boundary of the buffer may occur.",
    "root_cause": "The CoAP parser does not validate the token length against the input buffer length before accessing the token.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory access outside of the intended boundary of the buffer, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted CoAP message with a token length that exceeds the actual buffer size.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted CoAP message to the vulnerable device.",
