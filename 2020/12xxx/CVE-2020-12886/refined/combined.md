| Hi [@mjurczak](https://github.com/mjurczak),  I've been going through your pull request, and to me it seems like a good addition. I asked for a second opinion, but so far it's passing all the tests and nothing really seems out of place. I pushed some formatting fixes to the branch, hopefully that's okay to you.  I also noticed that you had few other branches in your fork. Is all the content here in this PR, or are there more pull requests incoming?  Best Regards, Esa |

### Description of defect

**References:**

<https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/mbed-os-5.15.3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap>

<https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/tree/v5.1.5>

**File:**

[sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c)

**Analysis:**

If a packet with declared token length larger than actually provided

is parsed, read out of the provided input buffer boundaries may occur.

Invalid memory access may occur in sn\_coap\_protocol\_malloc\_copy() as there is no check to verify if the arguments are within input buffer boundaries:

### Description of defect

**References:**

<https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/mbed-os-5.15.3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap>

<https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/tree/v5.1.5>

**File:**

[sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c)

```
Example Trace:
    #0  sn_coap_parser_options_parse_uint()
        sn_coap_parser.c:257
    #1  sn_coap_parser_options_parse()
        sn_coap_parser.c:531
    #2  sn_coap_parser()
        sn_coap_parser.c:161

```

**Analysis:**

If a packet with option delta lower than 13 is parsed, the remaning message length is incorrectly calculated in the line:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L329)

Line 329
in
[b6370b4](/ARMmbed/mbed-os/commit/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3)

|  | message\_left = packet\_len - ((\*packet\_data\_pptr) - packet\_data\_start\_ptr); |
| --- | --- |

The packet data pointer is not incremented prior to the remaining message length calculation and therefore it does not account for the option byte. This allows a malformed message with not option value following to pass through message length check in the line:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L331-L335)

Lines 331 to 335
in
[b6370b4](/ARMmbed/mbed-os/commit/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3)

|  | tr\_error("sn\_coap\_parser\_options\_parse - \*\*packet\_data\_pptr overflow !"); |
|  | return -1; |
|  | } |

For short options length the remaining message length is unchanged after option lengh processing:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L361)

| --- | --- |

Allowing to pass throught final message length check:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L391-L395)

|  | tr\_error("sn\_coap\_parser\_options\_parse - \*\*packet\_data\_pptr would overflow when parsing options!"); |
|  | return -1; |
|  | } |

In option processing code the packet data pointer is incremented beyond the input buffer boundary and passed for further processing, e.g. in:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L529)

|  | (\*packet\_data\_pptr)++; |
| --- | --- |

The invalid pointer is then accessed by functions called from option processing code, e.g. in:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L257)

## Description

A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn\_coap\_parser\_options\_parse\_multiple\_options() parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a single packet. While processing the options, packet\_data\_pptr is accessed after being incremented by option\_len without a prior out-of-bounds memory check. The temp\_parsed\_uri\_query\_ptr is validated for a correct range, but the range valid for temp\_parsed\_uri\_query\_ptr is derived from the amount of allocated heap memory, not the actual input size. Therefore the check of temp\_parsed\_uri\_query\_ptr may be insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by packet\_data\_pptr. As a result, access to a memory area outside of the intended boundary of the packet buffer is made.

## Description

A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn\_coap\_parser\_options\_parse() parses the CoAP packet header starting from the message token. The length of the token in the received message is provided in the first byte parsed by the sn\_coap\_parser\_options\_parse() function. The length encoded in the message is not validated against the actual input buffer length before accessing the token. As a result, memory access outside of the intended boundary of the buffer may occur.

```

**Analysis:**

If a packet with option delta equal to 13 or 14 is parsed with no extended option delta following, access beyond the packet data buffer is made due to insufficient message length checks:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L309-L322)

|  | if (option\_number == 13) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | option\_number = \*(\*packet\_data\_pptr + 1) + 13; |
|  | (\*packet\_data\_pptr)++; |
|  | } else if (option\_number == 14) { |
|  | if (message\_left >= 2){ |
|  | option\_number = \*(\*packet\_data\_pptr + 2); |
|  | option\_number += (\*(\*packet\_data\_pptr + 1) << 8) + 269; |
|  | (\*packet\_data\_pptr) += 2; |
|  | } else { |
|  | /\* packet\_data\_pptr would overflow! \*/ |
|  | tr\_error("sn\_coap\_parser\_options\_parse - \*\*packet\_data\_pptr overflow !"); |
|  | return -1; |
|  | } |
|  | } |

Before option number processing the message left bytes is calculated including the option delta/option length byte:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L298)

|  | message\_left = packet\_len - ((\*packet\_data\_pptr) - packet\_data\_start\_ptr); |
| --- | --- |

In case of option delta set to 13, the extended delta byte is accessed in the following line without prior check for buffer out-of-bound index:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L310)

|  | option\_number = \*(\*packet\_data\_pptr + 1) + 13; |
| --- | --- |

In case of option delta set to 14, the extended delta bytes are accessed with insufficient index check. As the message\_left variable includes the option delta byte, the check will pass malformed frame if there is only one extended delta byte following:

[mbed-os/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn\_coap\_parser.c](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/b6370b4c37f3d4665ed1cdcb1afea85396bba1b3/features/frameworks/mbed-coap/source/sn_coap_parser.c#L312-L315)

## Description

Buffer over-reads were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn\_coap\_parser\_options\_parse() parses CoAP input linearly using a while loop. Once an option is parsed in a loop, the current point (\*packet\_data\_pptr) is increased correspondingly. The pointer is restricted by the size of the received buffer, as well as by the option delta and option length bytes. The actual input packet length is not verified against the number of bytes read when processing the option extended delta and the option extended length. Moreover, the calculation of the message\_left variable, in the case of non-extended option deltas, is incorrect and indicates more data left for processing than provided in the function input. All of these lead to heap-based or stack-based memory location read access that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. Depending on the platform-specific memory management mechanisms, it can lead to processing of unintended inputs or system memory access violation errors.
