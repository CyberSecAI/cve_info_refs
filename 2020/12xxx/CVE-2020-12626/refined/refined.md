Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass in Roundcube that can be exploited to log out an authenticated user. The core issue is that the logout functionality did not properly check for a valid token, and the check was only performed on GET requests, allowing a malicious actor to trigger the logout via a POST request. Additionally, during a login attempt without a valid token, the active session was being deleted even when the user was already authenticated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF bypass:** The application did not properly validate the token for logout requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Inadequate request handling:** The application's `index.php` script incorrectly handled POST requests for logout actions and login attempts, particularly when no session was present, or the session was already authenticated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Forced Log Out:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to be logged out of their Roundcube session.
*   **Potential for Chained Exploits:** While the immediate impact is limited to forced logouts, this type of vulnerability can potentially be chained with other attacks, such as tricking a user to perform actions after they're logged out.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious HTML:** An attacker can embed a malicious form within a website or email that, when visited by a logged-in Roundcube user, will trigger the logout action. The user does not need to interact with the form, simply visiting the page is sufficient.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker could craft a link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, would trigger the logout.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to serve/send HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to serve or send an HTML page or form to the victim. This could be a webpage, a malicious email, or any other medium capable of rendering HTML.
*   **User is logged in:** The attacker must target a user that is currently logged into their Roundcube session.

**Technical Details:**
The fix involved the following changes:
*   **Token validation for logout:** The `request_security_check()` function in `index.php` was updated to check for tokens on both GET and POST requests for the logout action.
*   **Session handling on login:** Logic was added to prevent `kill_session()` from being called during the login process if the session already existed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Roundcube versions 1.4.4 and 1.3.11.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by xudongzheng.
*   The issue was tracked under pull request #7302 on GitHub.
*   The initial patch was discussed and refined by developers alecpl and thomascube.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4674-1 addresses this vulnerability along with CVE-2020-12625.
