Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-12687:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The provided content mentions a "serious security issue" pointed out by Antonious Papdopoulos. This suggests the commit `0b8600414976a5ad733604c7b1428071baf239c2` was created to address this security issue. However, the content does not explicitly detail the nature of the original vulnerability.
- The commit modifies `routes/admin.rb` by adding a single line. This line `redirect to('/no_access') unless is_administrator?` is likely a fix for an authorization bypass issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The vulnerability was likely a missing authorization check for the `/admin/attacments_backup` route. Without the `redirect to('/no_access') unless is_administrator?` line, it's implied that any user could trigger the attachments backup function.
- The code lacked a proper check to ensure that only administrators can access the backup functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An unauthorized user could potentially trigger a backup of all attachments.
- The impact is likely data exposure of all the attachments if the resulting zip file is not properly protected.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a direct HTTP request to the `/admin/attacments_backup` route.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application and needs to know the route `/admin/attacments_backup` exists. They don't need to be authenticated as an admin.

**Summary:**

The provided information strongly suggests that CVE-2020-12687 is related to an authorization bypass vulnerability in Serpico. Specifically, the lack of authorization checks on the `/admin/attacments_backup` route allowed non-admin users to initiate a backup of attachments. The commit `0b8600414976a5ad733604c7b1428071baf239c2` fixed this vulnerability by adding an administrator check.
