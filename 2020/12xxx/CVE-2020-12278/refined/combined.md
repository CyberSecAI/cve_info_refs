# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

This is a security release fixing the following issues:

* CVE-2019-1348: the fast-import stream command "feature

  export-marks=path" allows writing to arbitrary file paths. As

  libgit2 does not offer any interface for fast-import, it is not

  susceptible to this vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-1349](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-993f-36vw-6mhm "CVE-2019-1349"): by using NTFS 8.3 short names, backslashes or

  alternate filesystreams, it is possible to cause submodules to

  be written into pre-existing directories during a recursive

  clone using git. As libgit2 rejects cloning into non-empty

  directories by default, it is not susceptible to this

  vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-1350](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v94j-fmjr-xrgv "CVE-2019-1350"): recursive clones may lead to arbitrary remote

  code executing due to improper quoting of command line

  arguments. As libgit2 uses libssh2, which does not require us

  to perform command line parsing, it is not susceptible to this

  vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-1351](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74x9-89m7-944x "CVE-2019-1351"): Windows provides the ability to substitute

  drive letters with arbitrary letters, including multi-byte

  Unicode letters. To fix any potential issues arising from

  interpreting such paths as relative paths, we have extended

  detection of DOS drive prefixes to accomodate for such cases.
* [CVE-2019-1352](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74fq-3g57-65f7 "CVE-2019-1352"): by using NTFS-style alternative file streams for

  the ".git" directory, it is possible to overwrite parts of the

  repository. While this has been fixed in the past for Windows,

  the same vulnerability may also exist on other systems that

  write to NTFS filesystems. We now reject any paths starting

  with ".git:" on all systems.
* CVE-2019-1353: by using NTFS-style 8.3 short names, it was

  possible to write to the ".git" directory and thus overwrite

  parts of the repository, leading to possible remote code

  execution. While this problem was already fixed in the past for

  Windows, other systems accessing NTFS filesystems are

  vulnerable to this issue too. We now enable NTFS protecions by

  default on all systems to fix this attack vector.
* [CVE-2019-1354](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-57mj-9r29-rj3q "CVE-2019-1354"): on Windows, backslashes are not a valid part of

  a filename but are instead interpreted as directory separators.

  As other platforms allowed to use such paths, it was possible

  to write such invalid entries into a Git repository and was

  thus an attack vector to write into the ".git" dierctory. We

  now reject any entries starting with ".git" on all systems.
* [CVE-2019-1387](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9mhc-h3vf-83fw "CVE-2019-1387"): it is possible to let a submodule's git

  directory point into a sibling's submodule directory, which may

  result in overwriting parts of the Git repository and thus lead

  to arbitrary command execution. As libgit2 doesn't provide any

  way to do submodule clones natively, it is not susceptible to

  this vulnerability. Users of libgit2 that have implemented

  recursive submodule clones manually are encouraged to review

  their implementation for this vulnerability.

Debian Bug     : 892961 892962 903508 903509

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libgit2, a low-level Git library,
and are as follows:

CVE-2018-8098

    Integer overflow in the index.c:read_entry() function while
    decompressing a compressed prefix length in libgit2 before
    v0.26.2 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted repository index file.

CVE-2018-8099

    Incorrect returning of an error code in the index.c:read_entry()
    function leads to a double free in libgit2 before v0.26.2, which
    allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted
    repository index file.

CVE-2018-10887

    It has been discovered that an unexpected sign extension in
    git_delta_apply function in delta-apply.c file may lead to an
    integer overflow which in turn leads to an out of bound read,
    allowing to read before the base object. An attacker may use
    this flaw to leak memory addresses or cause a Denial of Service.

CVE-2018-10888

    A missing check in git_delta_apply function in delta-apply.c file,
    may lead to an out-of-bound read while reading a binary delta file.
    An attacker may use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service.

CVE-2018-15501

    In ng_pkt in transports/smart_pkt.c in libgit2, a remote attacker
    can send a crafted smart-protocol "ng" packet that lacks a '\0'
    byte to trigger an out-of-bounds read that leads to DoS.

CVE-2020-12278

    path.c mishandles equivalent filenames that exist because of NTFS
    Alternate Data Streams. This may allow remote code execution when
    cloning a repository. This issue is similar to CVE-2019-1352.

CVE-2020-12279

    checkout.c mishandles equivalent filenames that exist because of
    NTFS short names. This may allow remote code execution when cloning
    a repository. This issue is similar to CVE-2019-1353.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.25.1+really0.24.6-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgit2 packages.

path: also guard `.gitmodules` against NTFS Alternate Data Streams

```
We just safe-guarded `.git` against NTFS Alternate Data Stream-related
attack vectors, and now it is time to do the same for `.gitmodules`.

Note: In the added regression test, we refrain from verifying all kinds
of variations between short names and NTFS Alternate Data Streams: as
the new code disallows _all_ Alternate Data Streams of `.gitmodules`, it
is enough to test one in order to know that all of them are guarded
against.

Package        : libgit2
Version        : 0.27.7+dfsg.1-0.2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12278 CVE-2020-12279 CVE-2023-22742
Debian Bug     : 1029368

A vulnerability have been found in libgit2, a cross-platform, linkable
library implementation of Git, which may result in remote code execution
when cloning a repository on a NTFS-like filesystem or man-in-the-middle
attacks due to improper verification of cryptographic Signature.

CVE-2020-12278

    An issue was discovered in libgit2 before 0.28.4 and 0.9x before
    0.99.0.  path.c mishandles equivalent filenames that exist because of
    NTFS Alternate Data Streams. This may allow remote code execution when
    cloning a repository.

CVE-2020-12279

    An issue was discovered in libgit2 before 0.28.4 and 0.9x before
    0.99.0.  checkout.c mishandles equivalent filenames that exist because
    of NTFS short names. This may allow remote code execution when cloning a
    repository

CVE-2023-22742

    libgit2 is a cross-platform, linkable library implementation of Git.
    When using an SSH remote with the optional libssh2 backend, libgit2 does
    not perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions of libgit2
    require the caller to set the `certificate_check` field of libgit2's
    `git_remote_callbacks` structure - if a certificate check callback is
    not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate checking. This means
    that by default - without configuring a certificate check callback,
    clients will not perform validation on the server SSH keys and may be
    subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.27.7+dfsg.1-0.2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgit2 packages.

For the detailed security status of libgit2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libgit2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

This is v0.99 "Torschlusspanik". This will be the last minor release

before libgit2 v1.0. We expect to only respond to bugs in this release,

to stabilize it for next major release.

It contains significant refactorings, but is expected to be API-compatible

with v0.28.0.

### Changes or improvements

* When fetching from an anonymous remote using a URL with authentication

  information provided in the URL (eg `https://foo:bar@example.com/repo`),

  we would erroneously include the literal URL in the FETCH\_HEAD file.

  We now remove that to match git's behavior.
* Some credential structures, enums and values have been renamed:

  `git_cred` is now `git_credential`. `git_credtype_t` is now

  `git_credential_t`. Functions and types beginning with

  `git_cred_` now begin with `git_credential`, and constants beginning

  with `GIT_CREDTYPE` now begin with `GIT_CREDENTIAL`. The former names

  are deprecated.
* Several function signatures have been changed to return an `int` to

  indicate error conditions. We encourage you to check them for errors

  in the standard way.

* The NTLM and Negotiate authentication mechanisms are now supported when

  talking to git implementations hosted on Apache or nginx servers.
* The `HEAD` symbolic reference can no longer be deleted.
* `git_merge_driver_source_repo` no longer returns a `const git_repository *`,

  it now returns a non-`const` `git_repository *`.
* Relative symbolic links are now supported on Windows when `core.symlinks`

  is enabled.
* Servers that provide query parameters with a redirect are now supported.
* `git_submodule_sync` will now resolve relative URLs.
* When creating git endpoint URLs, double-slashes are no longer used when

  the given git URL has a trailing slash.
* On Windows, a `DllMain` function is no longer included and thread-local

  storage has moved to fiber-local storage in order to prevent race

  conditions during shutdown.
* The tracing mechanism (`GIT_TRACE`) is now enabled by default and does

  not need to be explicitly enabled in CMake.
* The size of Git objects is now represented by `git_object_size_t`

  instead of `off_t`.
* Binary patches without data can now be parsed.
* A configuration snapshot can now be created from another configuration

  snapshot, not just a "true" configuration object.
* The `git_commit_with_signature` API will now ensure that referenced

  objects exist in the object database.
* Stash messages containing newlines will now be replaced with spaces;

  they will no longer be (erroneously) written to the repository.
* `git_commit_create_with_signature` now verifies the commit information

  to ensure that it points to a valid tree and valid parents.
* `git_apply` has an option `GIT_APPLY_CHECK` that will only do a dry-run.

  The index and working directory will remain unmodified, and application

  will report if it would have worked.
* Patches produced by Mercurial (those that lack some git extended headers)

  can now be parsed and applied.
* Reference locks are obeyed correctly on POSIX platforms, instead of

  being removed.
* Patches with empty new files can now be read and applied.
* `git_apply_to_tree` can now correctly apply patches that add new files.
* The program data configuration on Windows (`C:\ProgramData\Git\config`)

  must be owned by an administrator, a system account or the current user

  to be read.
* `git_blob_filtered_content` is now deprecated in favor of `git_blob_filter`.
* Configuration files can now be included conditionally using the

  `onbranch` conditional.
* Checkout can now properly create and remove symbolic links to directories

  on Windows.
* Stash no longer recomputes trees when committing a worktree, for

  improved performance.
* Repository templates can now include a `HEAD` file to default the

  initial default branch.
* Some configuration structures, enums and values have been renamed:

  `git_cvar_map` is now `git_configmap`, `git_cvar_t` is now

  `git_configmap_t`, `GIT_CVAR_FALSE` is now `GIT_CONFIGMAP_FALSE`,

  `GIT_CVAR_TRUE` is now `GIT_CONFIGMAP_TRUE`, `GIT_CVAR_INT32` is now

  `GIT_CONFIGMAP_INT32`, and `GIT_CVAR_STRING` is now `GIT_CONFIGMAP_STRING`.

  The former names are deprecated.
* Repositories can now be created at the root of a Windows drive.
* Configuration lookups are now more efficiently cached.
* `git_commit_create_with_signature` now supports a `NULL` signature,

  which will create a commit without adding a signature.
* When a repository lacks an `info` "common directory", we will no

  longer erroneously return `GIT_ENOTFOUND` for all attribute lookups.
* Several attribute macros have been renamed: `GIT_ATTR_TRUE` is now

  `GIT_ATTR_IS_TRUE`, `GIT_ATTR_FALSE` is now `GIT_ATTR_IS_FALSE`,

  `GIT_ATTR_UNSPECIFIED` is now `GIT_ATTR_IS_UNSPECIFIED`. The

  attribute enum `git_attr_t` is now `git_attr_value_t` and its

  values have been renamed: `GIT_ATTR_UNSPECIFIED_T` is now

  `GIT_ATTR_VALUE_UNSPECIFIED`, `GIT_ATTR_TRUE_T` is now

  `GIT_ATTR_VALUE_TRUE`, `GIT_ATTR_FALSE_T` is now `GIT_ATTR_VALUE_FALSE`,

  and `GIT_ATTR_VALUE_T` is now `GIT_ATTR_VALUE_STRING`. The

  former names are deprecated.
* `git_object__size` is now `git_object_size`. The former name is

  deprecated.
* `git_tag_create_frombuffer` is now `git_tag_create_from_buffer`. The

  former name is deprecated.
* Several blob creation functions have been renamed:

  `git_blob_create_frombuffer` is now named `git_blob_create_from_buffer`,

  `git_blob_create_fromdisk` is now named `git_blob_create_from_disk`,

  `git_blob_create_fromworkdir` is now named `git_blob_create_from_workdir`,

  `git_blob_create_fromstream` is now named `git_blob_create_from_stream`,

  and `git_blob_create_fromstream_commit` is now named

  `git_blob_create_from_stream_commit`. The former names are deprecated.
* The function `git_oid_iszero` is now named `git_oid_is_zero`. The

  former name is deprecated.
* Pattern matching is now done using `wildmatch` instead of `fnmatch`

  for compatibility with git.
* The option initialization functions suffixed by `init_options` are now

  suffixed with `options_init`. (For example, `git_checkout_init_options`

  is now `git_checkout_options_init`.) The former names are deprecated.
* NTLM2 authentication is now supported on non-Windows platforms.
* The `git_cred_sign_callback` callback is now named `git_cred_sign_cb`.

  The `git_cred_ssh_interactive_callback` callback is now named

  `git_cred_ssh_interactive_cb`.
* Ignore files now:

  + honor escaped trailing whitespace.
  + do not incorrectly negate sibling paths of a negated pattern.
  + honor rules that stop ignoring files after a wildcard
* Attribute files now:

  + honor leading and trailing whitespace.
  + treat paths beginning with `\` as absolute only on Windows.
  + properly handle escaped characters.
  + stop reading macros defined in subdirectories
* The C locale is now correctly used when parsing regular expressions.
* The system PCRE2 or PCRE regular expression libraries are now used

  when `regcomp_l` is not available on the system. If none of these

  are available on the system, an included version of PCRE is used.
* Wildcards in reference specifications are now supported beyond simply

  a bare wildcard (`*`) for compatibility with git.
* When `git_ignore_path_is_ignored` is provided a path with a trailing

  slash (eg, `dir/`), it will now treat it as a directory for the

  purposes of ignore matching.
* Patches that add or remove a file with a space in the path can now

  be correctly parsed.
* The `git_remote_completion_type` type is now `git_remote_completion_t`.

  The former name is deprecated.
* The `git_odb_backend_malloc` is now `git_odb_backend_data_alloc`. The

  former name is deprecated.
* The `git_transfer_progress_cb` callback is now `git_indexer_progress_cb`

  and the `git_transfer_progress` structure is now `git_indexer_progress`.

  The former names are deprecated.
* The example projects are now contained in a single `lg2` executable

  for ease of use.
* libgit2 now correctly handles more URLs, such as

  `http://example.com:/repo.git` (colon but no port),

  `http://example.com` (no path),

  and `http://example.com:8080/` (path is /, nonstandard port).
* A carefully constructed commit object with a very large number

  of parents may lead to potential out-of-bounds writes or

  potential denial of service.
* The ProgramData configuration file is always read for compatibility

  with Git for Windows and Portable Git installations. The ProgramData

  location is not necessarily writable only by administrators, so we

  now ensure that the configuration file is owned by the administrator

  or the current user.

### API additions

* The SSH host key now supports SHA-256 when `GIT_CERT_SSH_SHA256` is set.
* The diff format option `GIT_DIFF_FORMAT_PATCH_ID` can now be used to

  emit an output like `git patch-id`.
* The `git_apply_options_init` function will initialize a

  `git_apply_options` structure.
* The remote callbacks structure adds a `git_url_resolve_cb` callback

  that is invoked when connecting to a server, so that applications

  may edit or replace the URL before connection.
* The information about the original `HEAD` in a rebase operation is

  available with `git_rebase_orig_head_name`. Its ID is available with

  `git_rebase_orig_head_id`. The `onto` reference name is available with

  `git_rebase_onto_name` and its ID is available with `git_rebase_onto_id`.
* ODB backends can now free backend data when an error occurs during its

  backend data creation using `git_odb_backend_data_free`.
* Options may be specified to `git_repository_foreach_head` to control

  its behavior: `GIT_REPOSITORY_FOREACH_HEAD_SKIP_REPO` will not skip

  the main repository's HEAD reference, while

  `GIT_REPOSITORY_FOREACH_HEAD_SKIP_WORKTREES` will now skip the

  worktree HEAD references.
* The `GIT_OPT_DISABLE_PACK_KEEP_FILE_CHECKS` option can be specified to

  `git_libgit2_opts()` to avoid looking for `.keep` files that correspond

  to packfiles. This setting can improve performance when packfiles are

  stored on high-latency filesystems like network filesystems.
* Blobs can now be filtered with `git_blob_filter`, which allows for

  options to be set with `git_blob_filter_options`, including

  `GIT_FILTER_NO_SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTES` to disable filtering with system-level

  attributes in `/etc/gitattributes` and `GIT_ATTR_CHECK_INCLUDE_HEAD` to

  enable filtering with `.gitattributes` files in the HEAD revision.

### API removals

* The unused `git_headlist_cb` function declaration was removed.
* The unused `git_time_monotonic` API is removed.
* The erroneously exported `inttypes.h` header was removed.

# Security Fixes

* CVE-2019-1348: the fast-import stream command "feature

  export-marks=path" allows writing to arbitrary file paths. As

  libgit2 does not offer any interface for fast-import, it is not

  susceptible to this vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-1349](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-993f-36vw-6mhm "CVE-2019-1349"): by using NTFS 8.3 short names, backslashes or

  alternate filesystreams, it is possible to cause submodules to

  be written into pre-existing directories during a recursive

  clone using git. As libgit2 rejects cloning into non-empty

  directories by default, it is not susceptible to this

  vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-1350](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v94j-fmjr-xrgv "CVE-2019-1350"): recursive clones may lead to arbitrary remote

  code executing due to improper quoting of command line

  arguments. As libgit2 uses libssh2, which does not require us

  to perform command line parsing, it is not susceptible to this

  vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-1351](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74x9-89m7-944x "CVE-2019-1351"): Windows provides the ability to substitute

  drive letters with arbitrary letters, including multi-byte

  Unicode letters. To fix any potential issues arising from

  interpreting such paths as relative paths, we have extended

  detection of DOS drive prefixes to accomodate for such cases.
* [CVE-2019-1352](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74fq-3g57-65f7 "CVE-2019-1352"): by using NTFS-style alternative file streams for

  the ".git" directory, it is possible to overwrite parts of the

  repository. While this has been fixed in the past for Windows,

  the same vulnerability may also exist on other systems that

  write to NTFS filesystems. We now reject any paths starting

  with ".git:" on all systems.
* CVE-2019-1353: by using NTFS-style 8.3 short names, it was

  possible to write to the ".git" directory and thus overwrite

  parts of the repository, leading to possible remote code

  execution. While this problem was already fixed in the past for

  Windows, other systems accessing NTFS filesystems are

  vulnerable to this issue too. We now enable NTFS protecions by

  default on all systems to fix this attack vector.
* [CVE-2019-1354](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-57mj-9r29-rj3q "CVE-2019-1354"): on Windows, backslashes are not a valid part of

  a filename but are instead interpreted as directory separators.

  As other platforms allowed to use such paths, it was possible

  to write such invalid entries into a Git repository and was

  thus an attack vector to write into the ".git" dierctory. We

  now reject any entries starting with ".git" on all systems.
* [CVE-2019-1387](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9mhc-h3vf-83fw "CVE-2019-1387"): it is possible to let a submodule's git

  directory point into a sibling's submodule directory, which may

  result in overwriting parts of the Git repository and thus lead

  to arbitrary command execution. As libgit2 doesn't provide any

  way to do submodule clones natively, it is not susceptible to

  this vulnerability. Users of libgit2 that have implemented

  recursive submodule clones manually are encouraged to review

  their implementation for this vulnerability.

### Breaking API changes

* The "private" implementation details of the `git_cred` structure have been

  moved to a dedicated `git2/sys/cred.h` header, to clarify that the underlying

  structures are only provided for custom transport implementers.

  The breaking change is that the `username` member of the underlying struct

  is now hidden, and a new `git_cred_get_username` function has been provided.

### Breaking CMake configuration changes

* The CMake option to use a system http-parser library, instead of the

  bundled dependency, has changed. This is due to a deficiency in

  http-parser that we have fixed in our implementation. The bundled

  library is now the default, but if you wish to force the use of the

  system http-parser implementation despite incompatibilities, you can

  specify `-DUSE_HTTP_PARSER=system` to CMake.
* The interactions between `USE_HTTPS` and `SHA1_BACKEND` have been

  streamlined. The detection was moved to a new `USE_SHA1`, modeled after

  `USE_HTTPS`, which takes the values "CollisionDetection/Backend/Generic", to

  better match how the "hashing backend" is selected, the default (ON) being

  "CollisionDetection". If you were using `SHA1_BACKEND` previously, you'll

  need to check the value you've used, or switch to the autodetection.

Disallow NTFS Alternate Data Stream attacks, even on Linux/macOS

```
A little-known feature of NTFS is that it offers to store metadata in
so-called "Alternate Data Streams" (inspired by Apple's "resource
forks") that are copied together with the file they are associated with.
These Alternate Data Streams can be accessed via `<file name>:<stream
name>:<stream type>`.

Directories, too, have Alternate Data Streams, and they even have a
default stream type `$INDEX_ALLOCATION`. Which means that `abc/` and
`abc::$INDEX_ALLOCATION/` are actually equivalent.

This is of course another attack vector on the Git directory that we
definitely want to prevent.

On Windows, we already do this incidentally, by disallowing colons in
file/directory names.

While it looks as if files'/directories' Alternate Data Streams are not
accessible in the Windows Subsystem for Linux, and neither via
CIFS/SMB-mounted network shares in Linux, it _is_ possible to access
them on SMB-mounted network shares on macOS.

Therefore, let's go the extra mile and prevent this particular attack
_everywhere_. To keep things simple, let's just disallow *any* Alternate
Data Stream of `.git`.

This is libgit2's variant of [CVE-2019-1352](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74fq-3g57-65f7 "CVE-2019-1352").

# Git mishandles the default NTFS Alternate Data Streams

High

GHSA-5wph-8frv-58vj

## Package

Git

## Affected versions

<=2.14.5, 2.15.3, 2.16.5, 2.17.2, 2.18.1, 2.19.2, 2.20.1, 2.21.0, 2.22.1, 2.23.0, 2.24.0

## Patched versions

2.24.1, 2.23.1, 2.22.2, 2.21.1, 2.20.2, 2.19.3, 2.18.2, 2.17.3, 2.16.6, 2.15.4, 2.14.6

## Description

### Impact

To support *Services for Macintosh* (and the concept of "resource forks"), NTFS introduced "Alternate Data Streams". These streams offer to store additional file content that is closely associated with the original file, and they can be accessed via `<original-file-name>:<attribute-name>`.

There is a default attribute name for the actual file's contents: reading `README::$DATA` is equivalent to reading `README`. Likewise, there is a default attribute name for *directories*: `.git::$INDEX_ALLOCATION/config` refers to the same file as `.git/config`.

In other words, there is an attack vector very similar to using NTFS short names to refer to files and directories via synonymous names (if short names are active, which they are on the system drive by default, then `git~1` is the same as `.git`).

While the short name attacks were prevented as part of Git 1.8.5.6 and the versions that were released simultaneously with it, in affected Git versions `core.protectNTFS` does not protect against those NTFS Alternate Data Streams attacks.

This is an issue on Windows, where Alternate Data Streams cannot be turned off on NTFS-formatted drives, and in conjunction with CVE-2019-1353 it also affects Git on macOS when working on `smb://`-mounted network shares.

It appears that in the default configurations, Git on Linux is *not* affected, not when working on NTFS mounts or CIFS-mounted network shares, not even when running inside the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) and working on Windows drives directly.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the versions published on Tuesday, December 10th, 2019.

On Windows, it is recommended to upgrade to [Git for Windows v2.24.1(2)](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.24.1.windows.2).

### Workarounds

Avoid cloning untrusted repositories.
