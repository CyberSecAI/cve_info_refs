{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the mishandling of equivalent filenames due to NTFS Alternate Data Streams.  Specifically, accessing the `.git` directory using alternate data stream syntax (e.g., `.git::$INDEX_ALLOCATION/config`) is equivalent to the standard path (`.git/config`), allowing for potential overwrites or other malicious activities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NTFS Alternate Data Streams",
      "Lack of sufficient path validation."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution may be possible by manipulating the `.git` directory or files through NTFS Alternate Data Streams during a clone operation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cloning a malicious repository using git on a NTFS-like filesystem.",
       "Using specifically crafted git repositories, including those on network shares such as SMB on macOS."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control a git repository, which can then be cloned by a victim. The victim must use libgit2 in a vulnerable way and have access to a NTFS-like file system. The attacker can also exploit this vulnerability on macOS systems when working on SMB network shares.",
    "more_details": "This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-1352 and is a result of not properly protecting against the usage of NTFS Alternate Data Streams to access the .git directory.  The patch disallows any Alternate Data Stream for the .git directory."
