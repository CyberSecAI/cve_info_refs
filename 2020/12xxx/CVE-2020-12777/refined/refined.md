{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The restore backup script, when called with an invalid token, displays the full path of the token and doesn't escape token name properly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Full Path Disclosure",
    "Improper Output Sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of the full path of the token, potentially revealing sensitive system information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Calling the restore backup script with an invalid token.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to call the restore backup script with an invalid token."
