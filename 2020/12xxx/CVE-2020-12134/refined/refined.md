{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a combination of two issues: a memory leak in the Jetty web server and improper protection of system logs by the Nanometrics Centaur/TitanSMA devices. Specifically, the Jetty version used (9.4.z-SNAPSHOT) has a memory leak of shared buffers which was supposedly fixed in version 9.2.9.v20150224, but the affected products are still vulnerable to this. Additionally, the devices fail to properly protect critical system logs, such as 'syslog'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File",
       "CWE-538: File and Directory Information Exposure"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can leak sensitive information from shared memory, potentially leading to session hijacking and authentication bypass scenarios. The attack also has a denial of service aspect due to the memory leak.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote, requiring an attacker to send malicious HTTP packets to the vulnerable devices.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, and no authentication is needed."
