# Exploit Title: Nanometrics Centaur 4.3.23 - Unauthenticated Remote Memory Leak
# Date: 2020-02-15
# Author: byteGoblin
# Vendor: https://www.nanometrics.ca
# Product: https://www.nanometrics.ca/products/accelerometers/titan-sma
# Product: https://www.nanometrics.ca/products/digitizers/centaur-digital-recorder
# CVE: N/A
#
# Nanometrics Centaur / TitanSMA Unauthenticated Remote Memory Leak Exploit
#
#
# Vendor: Nanometrics Inc.
# Product page: https://www.nanometrics.ca/products/accelerometers/titan-sma
# Product page: https://www.nanometrics.ca/products/digitizers/centaur-digital-recorder
#
# Affected versions:
#   Centaur  <= 4.3.23
#   TitanSMA <= 4.2.20
#
# Summary:
#   The Centaur Digital Recorder is a portable geophysical sensing acquisition system that consists
#   of a high-resolution 24-bit ADC, a precision GNSS-based clock, and removable storage capabilities.
#   Its ease of use simplifies high performance geophysical sensing deplayments in both remote and
#   networked environments. Optimized for seismicity monitoring, the Centaur is also well-suited for
#   infrasound and similar geophysical sensor recording applications requiring sample rates up to
#   5000 sps.
#
# Summary:
#   The TitanSMA is a strong motion accelerograph designed for high precision observational and
#   structural engineering applications, where scientists and engineers require exceptional dynamic
#   range over a wide frequency band.
#
# Description:
#   An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Centaur and TitanSMA fail to properly protect
#   critical system logs such as 'syslog'. Additionally, the implemented Jetty version (9.4.z-SNAPSHOT)
#   suffers from a memory leak of shared buffers that was (supposedly) patched in Jetty version 9.2.9.v20150224.
#   As seen in the aforementioned products, the 'patched' version is still vulnerable to the buffer leakage.
#   Chaining these vulnerabilities allows an unauthenticated adversary to remotely send malicious HTTP
#   packets, and cause the shared buffer to 'bleed' contents of shared memory and store these in system
#   logs. Accessing these unprotected logfiles reveal parts of the leaked buffer (up to 17 bytes per sent
#   packet) which can be combined to leak sensitive data which can be used to perform session hijacking
#   and authentication bypass scenarios.
#
# Tested on:
#   Jetty 9.4.z-SNAPSHOT
#
# Vulnerability discovered by:
#   byteGoblin @ zeroscience.mk

# Advisory ID: ZSL-2020-5562

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#### Nanometrics Centaur / TitanSMA Unauthenticated Remote Memory Leak Exploit

Title: Nanometrics Centaur / TitanSMA Unauthenticated Remote Memory Leak Exploit

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2020-5562](ZSL-2020-5562.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: System Access, DoS, Exposure of System Information, Exposure of Sensitive Information

Risk: (5/5)

Release Date: 15.02.2020
##### Summary

The Centaur digital recorder is a portable geophysical sensing acquisition
system that consists of a high-resolution 24-bit ADC, a precision GNSS-based clock,
and removable storage capabilities. Its ease of use simplifies high performance geophysical
sensing deployments in both remote and networked environments. Optimized for seismicity
monitoring, the Centaur is also well-suited for infrasound and similar geophysical
sensor recording applications requiring sample rates up to 5000 sps.

The TitanSMA is a strong motion accelerograph designed for high precision observational
and structural engineering applications, where scientists and engineers require exceptional
dynamic range over a wide frequency band.
##### Description

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Centaur and TitanSMA fail to properly protect
critical system logs such as 'syslog'. Additionally, the implemented Jetty version (9.4.z-SNAPSHOT)
suffers from a memory leak of shared buffers that was (supposedly) patched in Jetty version 9.2.9.v20150224.
As seen in the aforementioned products, the 'patched' version is still vulnerable to the buffer leakage.
Chaining these vulnerabilities allows an unauthenticated adversary to remotely send malicious HTTP
packets, and cause the shared buffer to 'bleed' contents of shared memory and store these in system
logs. Accessing these unprotected logfiles reveal parts of the leaked buffer (up to 17 bytes per sent
packet) which can be combined to leak sensitive data which can be used to perform session hijacking
and authentication bypass scenarios.
