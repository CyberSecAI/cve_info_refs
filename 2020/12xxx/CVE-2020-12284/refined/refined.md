Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-12284:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how FFmpeg incorrectly handles certain JPEG files. Specifically, a missing length check in `cbs_jpeg_split_fragment` function of `libavcodec/cbs_jpeg.c` allows for an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** When processing a JPEG file, the code reads a length value from the file and uses it to allocate memory. If this length value is greater than the available data, it will result in an out-of-bounds read due to missing check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to potentially obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (DoS). The Ubuntu security notice mentions "sensitive information or other unspecified impact", while the Debian security advisory mentions "denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code".

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted JPEG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed JPEG file to FFmpeg for processing. No specific capabilities are mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding a check to verify that the length read from the JPEG file does not exceed the available data before memory allocation.
- The vulnerability was found by a continuous fuzzing process.
- The vulnerability affects multiple distributions, including Debian and Ubuntu.
- A patch was made available in the FFmpeg repository.
