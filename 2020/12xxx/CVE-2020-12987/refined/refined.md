Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   A heap information leak/kernel pool address disclosure vulnerability exists in the AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Leak:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of heap information and kernel pool addresses.
-   **Insufficient Protection:** The driver does not adequately protect sensitive memory locations, leading to information exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **KASLR Bypass:** The leaked heap and kernel pool addresses can be used to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR). Bypassing KASLR makes it easier for attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities, as it allows them to predict the location of kernel modules and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker, indicating that the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-12987 is a medium severity vulnerability that allows for a heap information leak that can be used to bypass KASLR protection in the AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with local access to the system.
