The provided content relates to CVE-2020-12735.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the predictable method of generating temporary passwords using the `time()` function in PHP. The application uses the first 8 characters of the MD5 hash of the current Unix timestamp as the new password. This is deterministic and allows an attacker to reliably determine the new password by invoking the reset password functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Predictable password generation: The use of `time()` to generate the seed for the MD5 hash makes it possible to predict the new password.
- Insecure password reset mechanism: The application lacks a secure way to create random temporary passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account takeover: Attackers can change a user's password and reliably determine what the new password is, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the account.
- Privilege escalation: The vulnerability can be exploited to change the admin password and gain administrative privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a request to the `reset.php` endpoint providing the username or email of the target account.
- The attacker calculates the new password by generating the MD5 hash of the timestamp and taking the first 8 characters.
- The attacker uses the calculated password to log in to the target account.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of a valid username or email address registered on the application.
- Ability to execute scripts to calculate the MD5 hash of the timestamp.
