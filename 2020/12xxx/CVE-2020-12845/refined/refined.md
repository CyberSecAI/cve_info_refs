Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference that occurs during HTTP authentication in the Cherokee web server.
- The issue stems from the `cherokee_buffer_add` function, which does not allocate memory if the input string's size is zero or less. Critically, it returns `ret_ok` even in this case.
- Subsequent functions, specifically `cherokee_validator_parse_digest` and `cherokee_validator_parse_basic`, don't check the return value of `cherokee_buffer_add`. They proceed to dereference the uninitialized pointer (`auth.buf`), leading to a crash.
- The vulnerability is triggered by malformed "Authorization" headers in HTTP requests, which cause the size parameter in `cherokee_buffer_add` to be zero or negative when an empty Basic or Digest authentication string is passed, resulting in a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL pointer dereference:** The core vulnerability is dereferencing a NULL pointer when an invalid/empty authentication header is provided. This occurs because memory is not allocated in `cherokee_buffer_add` and later accessed as if it were initialized.
- **Lack of return value checking:** The functions `cherokee_validator_parse_digest` and `cherokee_validator_parse_basic` fail to validate the return value of `cherokee_buffer_add`. This allows the code to continue executing with an invalid buffer, which leads to the dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is that a remote attacker can crash the Cherokee web server by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with malformed "Authorization" headers. This leads to a denial of service, rendering the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **HTTP requests:** The attacker sends HTTP requests with a malformed `Authorization` header to a path that requires authentication. Specifically, an empty Basic or Digest authorization string will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the target Cherokee web server.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with customized headers.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue is present in Cherokee Web Server versions 0.4.27 to 1.2.104.
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing an empty `Authorization: Basic ` or `Authorization: Digest ` header to a path that returns `WWW-Authenticate` header.
- Gentoo has discontinued support for Cherokee and recommends unmerging the package.
- The issue is described in detail in the GitHub issue #1242.
