- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The default installation path for TwinCAT XAR 3.1 software is under `C:\TwinCAT`, and if this directory doesn't exist, it's created with permissions that allow any local user to modify its content. The `TcSysUI.exe` executable is registered for automatic execution upon user login.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) on the installation directory allow less privileged local users to modify or replace the `TcSysUI.exe` executable.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A less privileged local user can replace `TcSysUI.exe` with a malicious executable. When a higher-privileged user logs in, the malicious `TcSysUI.exe` will be executed with the privileges of the logged-in user, leading to privilege escalation.

- **Attack vectors:** Local access. A low-privileged user needs to modify a file in a folder where he has write permissions.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a local account on the system, and the ability to write to the `C:\TwinCAT` directory (default installation path).
