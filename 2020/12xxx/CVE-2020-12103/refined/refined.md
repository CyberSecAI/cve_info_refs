      "vulnerabilityDetails": "This blog post details CVE-2020-12103 as an arbitrary file copy vulnerability within Tiny File Manager 2.4.1. It allows an authenticated non-readonly user to create backup copies of files (with '.bak' extension) outside the application's scope by using absolute file paths. The attack vector is an HTTP POST request with `type=backup`, an absolute path in the `path` parameter, and the filename in the `file` parameter. This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read the source code of arbitrary PHP files on the server by creating a backup copy of that file. The root cause is improper input sanitization, and the impact of exploitation is information disclosure. The required attacker capability is to be an authenticated, non-readonly user."
