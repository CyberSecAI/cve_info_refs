```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read in the `decode_binary` function of SANE Backends.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `decode_binary` function copies data from a 64-byte stack buffer based on a size parameter controlled by the attacker, leading to an out-of-bounds read if the size parameter exceeds the buffer's limits.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By itself, this issue has low severity. However, it could be used by an attacker in combination with other vulnerabilities to obtain information such as ASLR offsets.
- **Attack vectors**: This vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim. When a scanning application such as `simple-scan` searches for scanners, it could connect to a malicious device that exploits this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network as the target, acting as a malicious device which can send specific crafted network messages to trigger the vulnerability.
