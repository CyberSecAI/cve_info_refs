Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure obfuscation of passwords and passphrases within the JobScheduler Object Editor (JOE).
*   JOE can be configured to store sensitive data locally.
*   This data is obfuscated using a symmetric key. However, the obfuscation method is weak, making the key guessable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Obfuscation:** The primary weakness is the use of a weak, guessable symmetric key for obfuscating sensitive data. This is not a true encryption.
*   **Storage of Sensitive Data:** JOE's design allows for the storage of passwords and passphrases on the local machine, which, if not properly protected, increases risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Credentials:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to recover the stored passwords and passphrases.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Gaining access to these credentials could enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems or resources that these credentials protect.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker would need access to the machine where JOE is configured and has stored the obfuscated credentials.
*   **Key Guessing:** The attacker would exploit the weakness of the obfuscation by guessing or deriving the symmetric key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the computer where JOE is running and storing the obfuscated passwords.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs the technical knowledge to understand how the obfuscation works and how to break it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in JOE versions 1.12.13 and 1.13.4.
*   The issue is tracked as JOE-290 in the SOS Berlin's Jira system.
*   Related issues JOE-291 and JOE-294 indicate related problems with password handling in JOE.
