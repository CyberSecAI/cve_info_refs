Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the SEOmatic plugin for Craft CMS 3.x.
- The root cause is the lack of sanitization in the `/helpers/DynamicMeta.php` file. Specifically, the plugin was not properly sanitizing URLs before using them to generate meta tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** An attacker can inject a Twig template through a URL part (after a semicolon). Because the plugin was using the URL to generate tags it was rendering the Twig template on the server.
- **Lack of URL Sanitization:**  The plugin failed to properly sanitize URL inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can leverage the SSTI to read sensitive data from the application's configuration files.
- **Database Credential Disclosure:** Specifically, attackers can use built-in Craft CMS methods to extract database usernames and passwords.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** SSTI vulnerabilities can often be leveraged for more severe attacks, such as remote code execution, depending on the specific template engine and context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious Twig template expression within the URL, specifically after a semicolon, which the application then processes unsafely.
- **Specifically Crafted URLs:**  Attackers craft malicious URLs to exploit the lack of input sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:**  An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the crafted malicious URLs to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Twig Syntax and Craft CMS:** A basic understanding of Twig template syntax and Craft CMS's built-in methods is needed to construct the attack payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.2.49.
- The fix implemented URL decoding using `urldecode()` before stripping tags to prevent template injection.
- The commit `82f4a25b28fd622393da6592dc9e5ccee7fc5be3` includes the security fix for this issue.
- The vulnerability was disclosed by ISEC.PL.
