### Added

* Aliases will now auto-suggest in the Site URL Override settings field
* SEOmatic now will replace any stripped HTML tags with a space, so that the text is more readable

### Fixed

* The Site URL Override is now parsed for both aliases and environment variables

### Security

* Ensure that URLs are `urldecode`d before attempting to use a RegEx to strip tags from them

=== Content from isec.pl_f49a3523_20250119_120122.html ===
Synopsis: Server-Side Template Injection in SEOmatic plugin for Craft CMS 3.x
Product: SEOmatic plugin for Craft CMS 3.x
Version: up to 3.2.48
Url: https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-seomatic
Author: PaweÅ HaÅdrzyÅski, Daniel Kalinowski from ISEC.PL
Issue:
======
Leaking sensitive data from the application (including database credentials) through Server Side Template Injection vulnerability.
Details:
========
Due to lack of sanitization in /helpers/DynamicMeta.php file, an attacker may inject a Twig template through a URL-part (after a semicolon).
This Twig template will be rendered in the server response - provoking a Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability.
By leveraging the Craft CMS build-in methods attacker may read information from the configuration files.
Injection of Twig template expression tags with a following value craft.config.get('password','db'),craft.config.get('user','db')
results in database credentials disclosure.
Proof of Concept:
========
https://isec.pl/en/vulnerabilities/isec-0028-seomatic-ssti-23032020.mp4
Timeline:
===========
Mar 23, 2020 - Vendor informed about the issue
Mar 23, 2020 - Vendor pushed fix
Apr 01, 2020 - Request for future communication despite the vulnerability and public disclosure
Apr 28, 2020 - Vendor stopped responding
May 11, 2020 - Public disclosure

|  |  | # SEOmatic Changelog |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 3.2.49 - 2020.03.24 |
|  |  | ### Added |
|  |  | \* Aliases will now auto-suggest in the Site URL Override settings field |
|  |  | \* SEOmatic now will replace any stripped HTML tags with a space, so that the text is more readable |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Fixed |
|  |  | \* The Site URL Override is now parsed for both aliases and environment variables |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Security |
|  |  | \* Ensure that URLs are `urldecode`d before attempting to use a RegEx to strip tags from them |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 3.2.48 - 2020.03.18 |
|  |  | ### Added |
|  |  | \* Added batching to sitemap generation so that the memory used is fixed, and no longer dependent on how many sitemap entries are being processed |
