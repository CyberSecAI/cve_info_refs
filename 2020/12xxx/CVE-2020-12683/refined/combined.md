## **Vulnerability Details**

| **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability** | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Severity**: **Medium** | **CVSS Score**: 5.4 | **CWE-ID**: [**CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79) | **Status**: Not Fixed |
| **Vulnerability Description** | | | |
| The web application running on Katyshop2 appliance is affected by multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities affecting version 2.11 and probably prior versions. These vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. | | | |
