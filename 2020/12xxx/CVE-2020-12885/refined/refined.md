Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-12885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options()` function in the CoAP library of Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. Specifically, it occurs when parsing CoAP options that can appear multiple times in a single packet. The function calculates the amount of heap memory needed to store the parsed options. If this calculation results in zero bytes, the loop that processes these options does not execute, leaving the `packet_data_pptr` unmodified. Consequently, the `sn_coap_parser_options_parse()` function which calls `sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options` can enter an infinite loop because the packet pointer doesn't advance and thus continues to process the same option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core vulnerability is an infinite loop caused by a flawed exit condition in the `sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options()` function when zero memory allocation is calculated.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The parser doesn't properly handle the case where a zero-length option is encountered in the input, resulting in the infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted CoAP packet with a zero-length option that is processed by the vulnerable function, an attacker can cause the parsing function to enter an infinite loop. This can lead to excessive resource consumption and prevent the device from performing its intended functions.
*   **Resource exhaustion:** The infinite loop consumes CPU resources, potentially leading to a system overload.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is the network. An attacker sends a specially crafted CoAP packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send network packets to the targeted device.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a CoAP packet containing a specific option sequence that results in a zero-length memory allocation calculation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `sn_coap_parser.c` file of the mbed-coap library.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `f50e331` as part of pull request #116 in the `PelionIoT/mbed-coap` repository.
*   The pull request also mentions that the fix includes improved boundary checks and improved end-of multiple options processing loop break conditions and simplifies the `sn_coap_parser_options_count_needed_memory_multiple_option()` function by reusing extended options number/length parsing functions.
*   The issue was reported in [ARMmbed/mbed-os#12929](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12929).
*   The issue is classified as "High severity".
