Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-12420, CVE-2020-12419, CVE-2020-12421, CVE-2020-12423 and CVE-2020-12422:

**CVE-2020-12420**

*   **Root cause:** A race condition during STUN server connection attempts could lead to a use-after-free.
*   **Weakness:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to an exploitable crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based, specifically related to WebRTC functionality.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to trigger the specific race condition when the application attempts to connect to a STUN server.

**CVE-2020-12419**

*   **Root cause:** A use-after-free in `nsGlobalWindowInner` due to window flushing in the parent process.
*   **Weakness:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
*  **Impact:** Memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash
*   **Attack Vectors:** Requires exploitation of a parent process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker needs to access the parent process and utilize the `promiseDocumentFlushed` method.

**CVE-2020-12421**

*   **Root cause:** Add-on updates not respecting the same certificate trust rules as software updates, leading to rejection of valid updates.
*   **Weakness:** Improper certificate validation.
*   **Impact:** Add-ons could become silently out-of-date without user notification.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based; exploitation through manipulated add-on update process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker would need to be able to intercept and modify add-on update traffic.

**CVE-2020-12423**

*  **Root cause:** DLL hijacking in Windows systems by placing a malicious `webauthn.dll` in a user's `%PATH%`.
*  **Weakness:** DLL hijacking due to an insecure DLL search path.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local exploitation; requires placing a malicious DLL in the user's path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to write to a directory in the user's path.

**CVE-2020-12422**

*   **Root cause:** An integer overflow in `nsJPEGEncoder::emptyOutputBuffer` could lead to out-of-bounds write and memory corruption.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially resulting in an exploitable crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based; requires triggering the overflow via a manipulated JPEG image processed by JavaScript.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires ability to serve a crafted JPEG image to the vulnerable application.
