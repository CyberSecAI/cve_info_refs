{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper implementation of CHACHA20-POLY1305 algorithm",
      "Out-of-bounds read due to undersized tag"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Multi-part Chacha20 decryption with undersized tag"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to supply data encrypted with multi-part Chacha20 with an undersized tag"
    ,
      "additional_information": "The issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length."
