## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-36

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 80

Announced
August 25, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 80

#### [#CVE-2020-15663: Downgrade attack on the Mozilla Maintenance Service could have resulted in escalation of privilege](#CVE-2020-15663)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu
Impact
high
##### Description

If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla Maintenance Service would execute updater.exe from the install location with administrative privileges. Although the Mozilla Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version could have been rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of an older bug and arbitrary code execution with system privileges.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-15664: Attacker-induced prompt for extension installation](#CVE-2020-15664)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
high
##### Description

By holding a reference to the `eval()` function from an about:blank window, a malicious webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result in an unintended or malicious extension being installed.

#### [#CVE-2020-12401: Timing-attack on ECDSA signature generation](#CVE-2020-12401)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida GarcÃ­a, JesÃºs-Javier Chi-DomÃ­nguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

* [Bug 1631573](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631573)

#### [#CVE-2020-6829: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to an electro-magnetic side channel attack on signature generation](#CVE-2020-6829)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida GarcÃ­a, JesÃºs-Javier Chi-DomÃ­nguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

#### [#CVE-2020-12400: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to a side channel attack on modular inversion](#CVE-2020-12400)

Reporter

Impact
moderate
##### Description

When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack.

* [Bug 1623116](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1623116)

#### [#CVE-2020-15665: Address bar not reset when choosing to stay on a page after the beforeunload dialog is shown](#CVE-2020-15665)

Reporter
Luan Herrera
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not reset the address bar after the beforeunload dialog was shown if the user chose to remain on the page. This could have resulted in an incorrect URL being shown when used in conjunction with other unexpected browser behaviors.

##### References

* [Bug 1651636](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651636)

#### [#CVE-2020-15666: MediaError message property leaks cross-origin response status](#CVE-2020-15666)

Reporter
Gunes Acar
Impact
low
##### Description

When trying to load a non-video in an audio/video context the exact status code (200, 302, 404, 500, 412, 403, etc.) was disclosed via the MediaError Message. This level of information leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks.

* [Bug 1450853](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1450853)

#### [#CVE-2020-15667: Heap overflow when processing an update file](#CVE-2020-15667)

Reporter
crixer
Impact
low
##### Description

When processing a MAR update file, after the signature has been validated, an invalid name length could result in a heap overflow, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution. Within Firefox as released by Mozilla, this issue is only exploitable with the Mozilla-controlled signing key.

##### References

* [Bug 1653371](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1653371)

#### [#CVE-2020-15668: Data Race when reading certificate information](#CVE-2020-15668)

Reporter
Tyson Smith
Impact
low
##### Description

A lock was missing when accessing a data structure and importing certificate information into the trust database.

#### [#CVE-2020-15670: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2](#CVE-2020-15670)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 79 and Firefox ESR 78.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

CVE ID         : CVE-2020-6829 CVE-2020-12400 CVE-2020-12401 CVE-2020-12403
                 CVE-2023-0767

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Network
Security Service libraries.

CVE-2020-6829

    When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point
    multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about
    the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace
    of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

CVE-2020-12400

    When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular
    inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible
    timing-based side channel attack.

CVE-2020-12401

    During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to
    ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in
    variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

CVE-2020-12403

    A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS.
    When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads.
    This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20
    (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length.

CVE-2023-0767

    Christian Holler discovered that incorrect handling of PKCS 12 Safe Bag
    attributes may result in execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted
    PKCS 12 certificate bundle is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:3.42.1-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

For the detailed security status of nss please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nss>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification

Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

#### [#CVE-2020-15664: Attacker-induced prompt for extension installation](#CVE-2020-15664)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
high
##### Description

By holding a reference to the `eval()` function from an about:blank window, a malicious webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result in an unintended or malicious extension being installed.

Impact
moderate
##### Description

During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

Impact
moderate
##### Description

When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

Impact
moderate
##### Description

When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-15666: MediaError message property leaks cross-origin response status](#CVE-2020-15666)

Reporter
Gunes Acar
Impact
low
##### Description

When trying to load a non-video in an audio/video context the exact status code (200, 302, 404, 500, 412, 403, etc.) was disclosed via the MediaError Message. This level of information leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks.

Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox for Android 79. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

[filed from mail to security@ from Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya]

Hello

We are a research group from Tampere University, Finland.

We have been analyzing NSS regarding side-channel vulnerabilities.

We have found that current NSS ECDSA code bypasses one countermeasure used

to prevent a timing attack during signature generation.

Please, find the details of our findings in the attached report.

Best regards,

Alejandro

[timing\_bypass\_ecdsa\_report.md attachment]

---

# ECDSA timing vulnerability.

A timing attacker against ECDSA signature generation is able to obtain information from the secret nonce measuring the time an ECDSA signature generation takes.

# Description

Current NSS code path has a countermeasure to prevent this know attack since 2011 [1] (actually cited in the code).

However, we have found that said countermeasure is currently completely bypassed.

The countermeasure is in ``lib/freebl/ec.c` :

`CHECK_MPI_OK(mp_add(&k, &n, &k));`

`if (mpl_significant_bits(&k) <= mpl_significant_bits(&n)) {`

`CHECK_MPI_OK(mp_add(&k, &n, &k));`

`}`

Thus when this code snipped is executed during an ECDSA signature generation,

the nonce is *padded* such that its bit-length reveals nothing about it.

However, subsequent function calls during scalar multiplication, `ECPoints_mul` and `ECPoint_mul`,

removes this padding, thus making the countermeasure useless.

(actually, only one removes the padding, but reporting both as fixing one will not fix the issue)

# Fix

Remove the unpadding from `ECPoints_mul` and `ECPoint_mul`.

We don't know if there is a correctness rationale to reduce this nonce, you know better.

# Disclosure

We are planning for a public disclosure on May 18. But this embargo date

is also up for discussion.

RedHat is tracking this as INC1266620 if we need to talk to their incident folks about it (as opposed to the NSS dev we know).

Thank you and your whole research group for this collection of reports. This comment is being added to each.

Iâ€™m assigning each of these to a team member for more detailed analysis beyond our initial triage. As all of these affect RHEL, I am also requesting impact analysis from our RedHat peers as well, as even if a side-channel is local, that might indicate higher-severity for server software than for Firefox. The analysis will also determine how to allocate CVE numbers, as needed.

I would like to advise that the embargo period your team has initially indicated is quite short, and in this case conflicts with both RedHat and Firefox release cycles. For a bug being actively exploited, we can do what is necessary; in the general case, our Release Calendar [0] indicates that to meet a 18 May disclosure date, we would need to make and uplift a point release of NSS from Nightly to Firefox Beta 76 within 8 days, which, given the complexity involved, seems unrealistic - and moreso for all four bugs at once. Weâ€™ll have a better idea as we complete our analysis of each bug.

Again, thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. Research such as yours makes the whole world safer!

[Bug 1631573: Remove unnecessary scalar padding in ec.c](attachment.cgi?id=9160924)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9160924&action=edit)

Subsequent calls to ECPoints\_mul and ECPoint\_mul remove this padding,

making the countermeasure ineffective since 2011.

Timing attack countermeasures are now applied more generally deeper in

the call stack.

Per JC, we're going to let these fixes ride the regular NSS trains without uplifting since the severity to Firefox is significantly lower.

[Bug 1631573](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631573 "RESOLVED FIXED - ECDSA Timing Countermeasure Bypass"): Remove unnecessary scalar padding in ec.c

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Moderate. It's much like [Bug 1631583](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631583 "RESOLVED FIXED - Side channel attack on ECDSA signature generation").
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: We can only backport this with [Bug 1631583](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631583 "RESOLVED FIXED - Side channel attack on ECDSA signature generation"), which we decided not to backport.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: This should ride the trains, not uplift.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:79.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/79.0

Steps to reproduce:

I created a form, that first loads about:blank into a full new window. I then used the onsubmit handler to load <https://fpn.firefox.com/> into this window which has the extension install permission, while holding a reference to the eval function for that window. Upon submitting the form I have scripted an install of ghostery.

Actual results:

The secondary prompt still displays, which asks a user for permissions to be allowed. Currently this stops a full install of a webextension, but allows for one to attempt more exploitation by manipulating input into Extensions.jsm.

Expected results:

Holding a reference to the eval function of a window should not allow one to inherit permissions of the window that is loaded. This allows all permissions to be inherited but proper defense in depth stops things like accessing video/microphone streams.

Storage APIs may still be able to be manipulated, as I have not had time to fully test this. This could allow one to pollute the local storage of extensions, and persistent webworker pages.

Hey guys, I haven't had time to fully follow up on the storage API permissions and such yet. I will continue to work on this as a fix is put in place. For any additional info please NI me.

Also, can I get this nominated for a sec-bounty? I know back in the day we would have made this a moderate but things have been changing. The potential for exploiting code in Extensions.jsm is high but my time is low.

I happened to mention a bug to Bobby a couple of days ago, I'll link him here.

I haven't actually debugged the testcase. But the way this is supposed to work is: Synchronously-created windows (iframes, and the return value of window.open) have an initial about:blank document that is same-origin with the creator. Upon navigation, we reuse/persist the global of that about:blank document (and thus globals like eval) of the initial about:blank window if the navigated-to document is same-origin.

So in general, the holdEval trick used in the testcase should just be acquiring the eval of the initial about:blank window, which should be different from fpn.firefox.com, and thus safe from a same-origin-policy perspective. But it could be the case that the permission handling here is out-of-band somehow, and that the inactive inner window is doing permission checks via the active one (via the outer/docshell). If that were the case, that would be bad.

I'll try to save you *some* time with the debugging. InstallTrigger is still only created upon request. Eval allows access to it as if it is the InstallTrigger Object of the about:blank page. InstallTrigger gets the principal it is working with from the window it is created for as it is accessed (lazy initialization). This makes the extension installation case a primary way to show this off.

As for further debugging, other permissions are inherited but only possibly useful case by case. Most seem to have proper defense in depth to prevent similar abuse. This eval trick was only to show off that permissions can get inherited and not meant to be a major point here. I know with so much attention being on webextensions right now, this was a good place to start.

As for further exploitation, I assume all the code in Extensions.jsm isn't supposed to be web facing. I have done practically no work on the storage issues this could lead to, as there's just no time for me to right now.

If I'm interrupting here and you guys want to just roll with this, that's fine with me. My debugging skills definitely aren't as sharp as most.

Looks like InstallTrigger is JS-implemented WebIDL [1]. Implementing in JS makes it much easier to succumb to inner/outer window confusion, wonder if that's what's happening here.

(To be clear I'm just speculating here since I don't have cycles to actually dig in. Hopefully Kris does.)

Yeah, it's a case of inner window confusion. The InstallTrigger's init method takes a window object, and saves the principal from its current document, when it's first initialized. If that happens after the window has navigated, then it winds up taking it from whatever the current document is.

We should probably just forbid initializing any JS-implemented WebIDL globals when their inner window isn't active.

As-is the testcase is a super bad spoof: wouldn't be too hard to imagine a "click here to get uBlock Origin from addons.mozilla.org" link, that when clicked opens AMO to the legit uBlock Origin page, and then uses this trick to prompt to install something else with a similar name. Or same name even? not sure the automatic scans require names to be unique. That's not quite sec-high because that powerful spoofing scenario is limited to a single site and action -- but it's a super powerful action!

There are two other objects created using the function that's being patched (that I found -- are there more?). One was the sidebar/add search provider function, but that's a deprecated stub and not useful. The other was the AddonManager. Looking at the IsValidHost logic it ought to be available on AMO but I couldn't get it to work. If you can it would be super powerful. AddonManager.getAddonByID() alone is fantastically useful. You could fingerprint people based on what they have installed. It looks like the "SyncGUID" is a per-install generated thing, if the victim has Sync. If the addon has an icon the URL gives me the full file path to the extension in my profile -- so that gets leaked if someone has a "load known local file" exploit. And if you could make this work and you didn't like adblockers you could have fun with this:

1. Install uBlock Origin if you don't have it already
2. open about:preferences (need it privileged since I couldn't get AMO to work)
3. open the DevTools console
4. execute `(await AddonManager.getAddonByID("uBlock0@raymondhill.net")).disable()`

If you want to play and see what other data is available do `await AddonManager.getAddonByID("uBlock0@raymondhill.net")`

.uninstall() also works (more realistic attack) but harder to undo as a test! change disable() to enable() to get your addon back (or manually in about:addons).

Like I said, I couldn't make that actually work on AMO, but maybe I'm missing something. It's certainly a juicy enough target to be worth playing with.

Testcase works on Firefox ESR-68 (as expected) so we'll need a patch for that, too. The "fpn" site wasn't in the whitelist back then so you have to either manually add the site as an ALLOW exception first, or modify the testcase to use AMO which *was* in the built-in exception list.

The AddonManager API isn't vulnerable to this issue. The decision on whether or not to make that available happens in C++ via `AddonManagerWebAPI::IsAPIEnabled`, which isn't susceptible to inner window confusion.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Fairly easily, given the small number of APIs constructed this way, but the actual risk of the exploit is relatively low.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: It should already apply cleanly to all branches.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Unlikely. It only affects constructing objects for 3 rarely-used APIs when a window has been navigated away from, which no valid code should be relying on.
