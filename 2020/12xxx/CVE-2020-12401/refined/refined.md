Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12401:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the removal of padding during ECDSA signature generation. The padding was initially designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication, which prevents timing attacks. By removing the padding, the execution time of the scalar multiplication became dependent on secret data (the nonce), creating a timing side channel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Timing Side Channel:** The core issue is a timing side channel vulnerability in the ECDSA signature generation process. By measuring the time it takes to generate a signature, an attacker could gain information about the secret nonce.
- **Bypass of Countermeasure:** A previously implemented countermeasure to prevent timing attacks (padding the nonce) was bypassed by subsequent function calls that removed the padding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Private Key Leakage:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the leakage of the private key used for ECDSA signatures.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Timing Analysis:** The attack vector relies on analyzing the timing of ECDSA signature generation.
- **Side-Channel Attack:** This is a side-channel attack, meaning it extracts information based on the implementation details rather than a direct flaw in the algorithm itself.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Precise Timing Measurement:** The attacker would need the capability to measure the time it takes for the vulnerable code to generate ECDSA signatures with high precision.
- **Local/Remote Access:** While the text doesn't specify whether the attacker needs to be local or can be remote, the nature of timing attacks implies that closer proximity could potentially yield more accurate measurements.

**Additional details:**
- **Affected Components**: The vulnerability existed within the Network Security Services (NSS) library.
- **Fix:** The fix involved reimplementing the countermeasure by preventing the removal of the nonce padding during scalar multiplication, ensuring constant time execution of this operation and preventing timing attacks.
- **Mitigation:** Since the fix was deployed, the vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 80, other versions were either marked as wontfix or fixed.
- **Researchers:** The vulnerability was discovered by a research group at Tampere University, Finland.
