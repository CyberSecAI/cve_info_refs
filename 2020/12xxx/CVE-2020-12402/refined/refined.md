Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way RSA key generation was implemented in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. Specifically, the bignum implementations used a variant of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm (BEEA) for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and modular inversion. This algorithm had a control flow that was highly dependent on the inputs (p-1 and q-1 which are parts of private key), leading to a side-channel vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Side-Channel Attack Vulnerability:** The use of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm (BEEA) in `mp_gcd` and `mp_invmod` resulted in an input-dependent control flow. This allowed attackers to recover the RSA private key by observing side-channel leakage, specifically timing information, EM emanation, or cache timing.
*   **Non-constant time operations:** Vulnerable functions such as `mp_gcd`, and `mp_invmod` were based on variations of BEEA, which exhibited timing differences based on input values. The `mpl_significant_bits` function also contained non-constant time conditional logic.
*   **Code paths with branches:** Functions such as `s_mp_div_2d` contained conditional code branches, causing input dependent timing.
*   **Incorrect MP handling:** There was a bug in `s_mp_clamp` where right-shifting a negative number to zero was not handled correctly with regard to the sign. A bug in `s_mp_invmod_2d` caused a sign error in some cases. `s_mp_mul_2d` had an out of bounds memory access issue, as well.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Private Key Recovery:** Attackers, by performing side-channel analysis (electromagnetic analysis, timing, cache analysis), could recover the RSA private keys generated by vulnerable versions of NSS.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Recovering the private key would lead to the ability to decrypt communication encrypted using the corresponding public key.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack with Side Channel Analysis:** The primary attack vector involves a local attacker with the ability to perform side-channel analysis. This often involves measuring electromagnetic emanations, timing differences, or cache timing variations during the execution of the vulnerable algorithms.
*   The vulnerability is primarily local (requiring some form of proximity) but it might also be exploitable via a compromised content process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity/Local Access:** Attackers need the ability to perform side-channel analysis, meaning they typically need some level of physical access or a compromised content process with fine grained timing capabilities to the system running the vulnerable NSS library.
*   **Specialized Equipment/Techniques:** Attackers need tools/techniques for side-channel analysis, such as electromagnetic sensors, or software/hardware based timing analysis.
*   **Knowledge of Cryptography/RSA:** Knowledge of the structure and the mathematics of RSA and how it relates to the used algorithms (BEEA) is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is primarily exposed during RSA key generation, which is not a common operation for end-users of Firefox. However, applications and systems using the NSS library may be affected.
*   The fixes involved implementing constant-time versions of `mp_gcd` and `mp_invmod`, and also making other multi-precision functions safer and timing independent.
*   The vulnerability was reported by a team of security researchers from Tampere University, Finland and has been fixed in NSS version 3.53.1.
*   The fix also involves addressing other potential side channel leaks in helper functions of the used multi-precision integer library.
*   The fix also addresses a corner case bug in `s_mp_invmod_2d` where the sign of the input operand wasn't properly transferred to the output.
*   The fix also addressed issues in `s_mp_clamp`, `s_mp_mul_2d`, `s_mp_div_2d`, and `mpl_significant_bits`.
* The fixed version was backported to Firefox 78.
* Several SUSE and openSUSE products were affected.
