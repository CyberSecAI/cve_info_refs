Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12421:

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The vulnerability stems from add-on updates not respecting the same certificate trust rules as software updates. Specifically, when performing add-on updates, certificate chains that did not terminate in built-in root certificates were rejected, even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
* Inconsistent certificate handling: Add-on updates had stricter certificate requirements compared to software updates.
* Lack of trust for administrator-added roots: Legitimate certificates added by administrators were not being trusted during add-on updates.

**Impact of exploitation**:
* Add-ons become out-of-date: The vulnerability could cause add-ons to fail to update silently, without any notification to the user.
*  Add-on security updates blocked: Since updates fail, security updates for addons can be blocked which could expose the system to additional security vulnerabilities from out-of-date addons.

**Attack vectors**:
* Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks: Although it's not a direct exploitation in itself, the lack of trust for administrator-added roots means that the intended use case for the feature is broken when using a MITM proxy/device.
* Malicious or compromised update servers: If an attacker could compromise an add-on update server and present a certificate that is not signed by a built-in root certificate, the update would be silently rejected instead of informing the user of a problem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
*   For a direct exploit of this issue, a compromised add-on update server would be required.
* For the MITM scenario, a network positioned attacker with the ability to intercept and modify traffic is required.
* For the unintended consequence of blocked updates, users who are running a MITM proxy/device or an antivirus that intercepts and replaces certificates are in a position where the updates would not succeed.

**Additional Notes**:

* The vulnerability is described as having a "moderate" impact.
* The vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.
* The fix involves relaxing the built-in certificate requirement for add-on updates.
* The Mozilla bug report ([Bug 1308251](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1308251)) gives more context to the issue and the various fixes.
* SUSE and Gentoo also provide information regarding impacted versions and patches.
