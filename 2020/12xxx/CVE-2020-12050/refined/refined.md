Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12050:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `sqliteodbc` package installation script. The script creates a temporary configuration file in the `/tmp` directory with a predictable filename (`/tmp/sqliteodbcinst$$`, where `$$` is the process ID). This filename is predictable, allowing an attacker to pre-create files or hardlinks with the same name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Predictable Temporary File Creation:** The use of a predictable filename based on the process ID for temporary file creation in `/tmp` is a significant weakness.
*   **Race Condition:**  A race condition exists where an attacker can overwrite the temporary configuration file before it is read by the `odbcinstall` command.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The installation script does not properly handle cases where a file already exists with the same temporary filename before writing to it. Instead of creating it securely, it overwrites it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation to Root:** By winning the race condition and writing a malicious configuration file that loads an arbitrary library, an attacker can achieve local privilege escalation to root. The attacker can cause the system to load a malicious library under the guise of the ODBC driver, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the content of the temporary file, the attacker can inject their own code which is then loaded into the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create files or hardlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Race Condition Exploitation:** The attacker needs to trigger the race condition by creating a malicious file and then installing or updating the vulnerable package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege User:** The attacker does not need to have root or administrative privileges to start the exploit. A normal user with local access can perform this attack.
*   **File Creation:** The attacker must be able to create files and/or hardlinks in `/tmp`.
*   **Timing:** The attacker must execute their exploit code at the right time during the installation of the vulnerable package to win the race condition.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet from the install script is:

```bash
if [ -x /usr/bin/odbcinst ] ; then
    INST=/tmp/sqliteodbcinst$$
    if [ -r /usr/lib64/libsqliteodbc.so ] ; then
        cat > $INST <<- 'EOD'
            [SQLITE]
            Description=SQLite ODBC 2.X
            Driver=/usr/lib64/libsqliteodbc.so
            Setup=/usr/lib64/libsqliteodbc.so
            Threading=2
            FileUsage=1
        EOD
        /usr/bin/odbcinst -q -d -n SQLITE | grep '^\[SQLITE\]' >/dev/null || {
            /usr/bin/odbcinst -i -d -n SQLITE -f $INST || true
        }
```

The fix involves using `mktemp(1)` to create the temporary file, which ensures that the file is created with a unique and unpredictable name, eliminating the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Sysdream and assigned CVE-2020-12050.
*   The affected package version was `sqliteodbc-0.9996-4` in several Linux distributions.
*   Patches have been released for Fedora, openSUSE, and other distributions which use a unique name for temporary files.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit was created using Golang which created hardlinks targeting the predictable /tmp file name to increase chances of winning the race condition.
