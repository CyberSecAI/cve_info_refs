Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12685:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the admin help and quicklinks pages. Specifically, the `topic` parameter in the help page and the `mv_arg` parameter in the quicklinks page were vulnerable to XSS. These parameters were used to display content on the pages without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. Malicious scripts could be injected via crafted URLs through the vulnerable parameters (`topic` and `mv_arg`)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript that steals client-side credentials such as session cookies, allowing for unauthorized access or impersonation.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate or access data displayed on the vulnerable pages.
- **Redirection:** Malicious scripts could redirect users to other malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Tainted Links:** Attackers could craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload, and distribute these links to unsuspecting users.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers may use social engineering to trick administrators into clicking on a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** Attackers need to be able to craft URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads injected via the `topic` or `mv_arg` parameters.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires a victim (administrator) to click on the malicious URL.
- **No special access needed:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability but does require a logged-in admin to be affected.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code was present in `dist/lib/UI/pages/admin/help.html` and `dist/lib/UI/pages/admin/quicklinks.html`.
- The fix involved sanitizing the user-supplied `topic` and `mv_arg` parameters by removing any characters that are not alphanumeric or a dot, in the case of the `topic` parameter and removing any non-alphanumeric characters for `mv_arg`.
- The fix also gates these pages, requiring users to be logged in to access them.
- The vulnerability affected Interchange versions 4.7.0 through 5.11.x (before 2020-05-15).
- The issue was found and reported by Sean Fernandez.
- The fix was included in commit `243ab0eea0a`, and can be applied by updating the affected files to the versions in that commit, or downloading the updated versions of the files directly.
- The nightly builds and the upcoming 5.12.0 release also include the fix.
