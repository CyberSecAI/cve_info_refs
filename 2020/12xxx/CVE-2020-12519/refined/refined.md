- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Privilege Management
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An attacker can gain root privileges on affected devices
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can open a reverse shell with root privileges on the target device, achieving full control.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network exploitable (AV:N) and does not require any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network without authentication or user interaction.
