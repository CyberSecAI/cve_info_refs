Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12618:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes a research paper that specifically mentions CVE-2020-12618. The paper discusses vulnerabilities in email clients related to end-to-end encryption, and states that they reported their findings, resulting in, among other CVEs, CVE-2020-12618. This confirms that the content is directly related to the CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The root cause is the improper handling of the `mailto` URI scheme by certain email clients. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from email clients supporting non-standard `attach` or `attachment` parameters in `mailto` URIs. These parameters allow a malicious actor to force the email client to attach local files to an email without explicit user consent.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper input validation:** Email clients lack sufficient input validation when processing `mailto` URIs, allowing arbitrary file paths to be specified in the `attach` parameter.
    *   **Lack of user awareness:** Email clients fail to notify users that local files have been attached via a `mailto` URI. This allows for the exfiltration of sensitive files without the user's knowledge.
    *   **Support for non-standard parameters:** Some email clients improperly handle non-standard parameters (`attach`, `attachment`) in mailto URIs
    *   **Directory Traversal:** Some email clients allow directory traversal through the attach parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Private key exfiltration:** A malicious actor can exfiltrate private keys (e.g., PGP keys, SSH keys, Bitcoin wallets) from the victim's machine by embedding a `mailto` URI in a website, document or other malicious content.
    *   **NTLM Hash leakage:** Windows-based clients can be tricked into leaking NTLM hashes to a remote server by specifying a network share in the `attach` parameter.
    *  **IMAP data exfiltration:** Specific clients, like Thunderbird, can be forced to exfiltrate data from the victim's mailbox.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious website:** The attacker can embed a malicious `mailto` URI on a website visited by the victim.
    *   **Malicious documents:** The attacker can embed the malicious `mailto` URI inside PDF documents or similar formats, which the victim opens using a vulnerable viewer application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted `mailto` URI to the victim's email client (e.g., via web page, email, PDF doc)
    *   The attacker needs a method to receive the exfiltrated data (e.g., their own email address).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The paper mentions that Thunderbird, Evolution, and KMail are vulnerable to this attack, allowing for the exfiltration of the GnuPG secret keyring. IBM Notes was also vulnerable and allowed network share access, leaking NTLM hashes.
*  Thunderbird also has an additional vector by which IMAP stored emails can be exfiltrated by using the proprietary `imap://` URI scheme in the attach parameter.
*   The research paper provided more in-depth details and context about the vulnerability than the typical CVE description.

In summary, the content provides detailed insight into the root cause, mechanism, and impact of CVE-2020-12618. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper handling of the `attach` parameter in `mailto` URIs, allowing attackers to exfiltrate private keys and other sensitive data from the user's system.
