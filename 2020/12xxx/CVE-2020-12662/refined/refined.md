Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-12662:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   **Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume:** The root cause is that Unbound doesn't adequately control the volume of network messages, specifically when handling NS records. This is referred to as an "NXNSAttack" issue. The issue is triggered by random subdomains within the NSDNAME field of NS records.
*   **Cache Bypassing:**  The attack exploits Unbound's DNS resolution process, specifically how it handles NS referral responses without corresponding IP address records (glue records). The use of random subdomains in NS records bypasses the resolver's cache.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Amplification Attack:** The primary vulnerability is that Unbound can be tricked into generating a significantly larger number of outgoing queries than the incoming query it received. This amplification can be used in denial of service attacks.
*   **Cache Saturation:** The attack also has the potential to saturate the resolver's caches, particularly the 'NS' record caches, due to numerous requests for non-existent or random subdomains.

**3. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a DoS, which can occur against either:
    *   The Unbound resolver itself, as it becomes overwhelmed by processing a large volume of queries.
    *   Third-party authoritative name servers, which become the targets of a flood of amplified DNS queries.
*   **Performance Degradation:** The excessive number of queries will degrade the performance of the affected resolver due to the processing overhead.

**4. Attack Vectors**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely via the network.
*   **DNS Queries:** Attackers craft DNS queries with malicious NS records with random subdomains, and the target unbound instance then queries for these non existent NS records.
*  **Authoritative DNS server:** An attacker needs control or access to an authoritative DNS server to construct malicious NS records for an amplification attack.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to send DNS queries to a vulnerable Unbound resolver.
*   **Authoritative DNS Control:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the DNS records of an authoritative server or control a malicious authoritative server. This is essential to craft the malicious NS referral responses.
*   **No User Interaction Needed**: The attack does not need any action or interaction from the user of the vulnerable system.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable resolver to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by using various amplification techniques described as variants (a, b, c).  Variant C involves self delegations that increases amplification factor.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers from Tel Aviv University, who have named it the "NXNSAttack".
*   The vulnerability was addressed by an updated version of Unbound (1.10.1).
*   The issue is categorized as having "important" or "high" severity.
*   The vulnerability can affect recursive resolvers and even authoritative servers that have configured zone forwarding.

In summary, CVE-2020-12662 involves a DNS amplification attack achieved by exploiting how Unbound handles NS records with missing glue records and random subdomains, leading to a potential denial of service against the resolver itself and/or third party authoritative servers.
