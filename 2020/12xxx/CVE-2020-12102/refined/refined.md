Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `path` parameter in the `search` functionality of Tiny File Manager. This allows for path traversal, enabling an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended scope of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `path` parameter provided in the HTTP POST request for the `search` functionality. This allows an attacker to use `../` sequences to navigate to parent directories.
*   **Recursive Directory Listing:** The `scan` function recursively lists all files and directories within the specified path, exposing the file structure to the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can enumerate files and directories outside the application's intended scope.
*   **Source Code Disclosure:** By combining this vulnerability with CVE-2020-12103 (Arbitrary File Copy), an attacker can create backup copies of PHP files with a `.bak` extension, allowing them to view the source code in clear text.
*   **Complete Information Disclosure**: The combination of both vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to enumerate and read the source code of all php files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `tinyfilemanager.php` script with `type=search` and a malicious `path` parameter containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as a non-readonly user or authentication must be disabled in the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Tiny File Manager instance.
* **Knowledge of the Target**: The attacker needs knowledge of the target location of files and folder to access the file or folder.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Tiny File Manager version 2.4.1 and was fixed in version 2.4.2.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `path` parameter using the `fm_clean_path()` function before processing the file search request. This prevents path traversal.
*   The related commit on Github shows the code changes to address this issue and adds the `fm_clean_path()` function to sanitize the input.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Michele ‘cyberaz0r’ Di Bonaventura.
