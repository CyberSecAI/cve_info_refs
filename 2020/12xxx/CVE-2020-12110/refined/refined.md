{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of a hardcoded encryption key within the `swSystemBackup` and `sym.swSystemRestoreFile` methods. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt configuration backup files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded encryption key, use of DES ECB with modified s-boxes and permutation tables.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can decrypt backup files to access sensitive data, including FTP server credentials, WLAN passphrases, PPPoE credentials, SMTP server credentials, and DDNS credentials. Furthermore, attackers can create forged, encrypted backup files to overwrite arbitrary files on the device, potentially leading to code execution as root or permanent damage.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker would first need to reverse engineer the modified DES algorithm to create or decrypt backup files. The attacker would then either decrypt existing backup files or create a malicious one.  The malicious backup file can then be uploaded via the web interface to overwrite arbitrary files on the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the device's web interface, and have knowledge of the modified DES algorithm used for encryption/decryption."
