The provided content relates to CVE-2020-12443.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue in BigBlueButton (BBB). It stems from the way the application handles requests for downloadable presentation files. Specifically, the application was not properly validating the requested file path, which allowed attackers to potentially access files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application did not properly sanitize or validate the path of the requested presentation file. This allowed an attacker to potentially specify a path to a file on the server, outside the intended presentation directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the server, which might contain sensitive data, such as configuration files, user data, or other private information.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious request to download a presentation file, where the filename parameter contains directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker could access files outside the presentation directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the BigBlueButton server. The user would also need to have a valid meeting ID.
- They would need to be familiar with the structure of the BigBlueButton server to navigate the file system to the target file.

**Additional details:**
- The provided pull request ([https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/9259](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/9259)) shows the fix for this vulnerability. It introduces a check to ensure that the requested file path starts with the allowed `presentationBaseDir`, preventing access to files outside that directory. The fix is in the `RecordingService.java` file.
- The `PresentationController.groovy` file was also modified to return a `404` error when the requested presentation does not exist.
- The commit message `Return 404 error when the file download is not allowed` further confirms the nature of the fix.
