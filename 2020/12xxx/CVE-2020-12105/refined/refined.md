Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-12105:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of negative return values from the `X509_check_host` and `X509_check_ip` functions within the Openconnect VPN client. These functions are part of the OpenSSL library and are intended to verify if a certificate matches a given hostname or IP address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Error Handling:**  Openconnect incorrectly interprets negative return values from `X509_check_*` functions as a successful validation of the certificate. Specifically,  a return value of -2 (indicating a malformed input like a null byte in the certificate's SAN or CN) is treated as a valid certificate.
*   **Logic Error**: The code's logic fails to correctly handle the error conditions of the X509 validation functions, resulting in a bypass of the certificate verification process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack by presenting a specially crafted certificate to a vulnerable Openconnect client. This allows the attacker to intercept and potentially modify communication between the client and the VPN server.
*   **Bypassed Certificate Verification:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass certificate verification, thereby compromising the security of the VPN connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is network-based, as the attacker intercepts the communication between the VPN client and server.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), but the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) needs to contain a null byte to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the Openconnect client and the VPN server. This could involve being on the same network (e.g., a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot) or compromising network infrastructure.
*   **Valid Certificate:** The attacker needs a valid certificate signed by a trusted CA, but this certificate must be crafted to have a null byte in its CN or SAN to cause `X509_check_host` to return a negative value.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the code incorrectly checks the return value from `X509_check_*` functions, not differentiating between a successful match (1), no match (0), and errors (-1, -2).
*   The fix involves correctly interpreting the return values, ensuring that only a value of 1 indicates a successful certificate match.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which simply states: "OpenConnect through 8.08 mishandles negative return values from X509\_check\_ function calls, which might assist attackers in performing man-in-the-middle attacks."
