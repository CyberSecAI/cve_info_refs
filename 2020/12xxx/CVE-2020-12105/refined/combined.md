The X509\_check\_host and X509\_check\_ip functions are a part of a collection of functions used to match certain properties of certificates. They are used to check whether a certificate matches a given host name, email address, or IP address and are available since OpenSSL 1.0.2. In particular, the X509\_check\_host function checks if the certificate's Subject Alternative Name or CommonName matches the specified host name.

int X509\_check\_host(X509 \*, const char \*name, size\_t namelen, unsigned int flags, char \*\*peername);
These functions return 1 for a successful match, 0 for a failed match, -1 for an internal error, or -2 if the input is malformed.

Openconnect unfortunately incorrectly uses this function. If an attacker can force the function to fail with a negative value, the if condition will evaluate to true, setting the value of cert\_valid to one (valid). Making the API return a negative value is a trivial thing since any certificate with a null byte on its SAN or CN will make it return -2.

This vulnerability allows an attacker that is able to get valid certificates from a CA with a specially crafted CommonName to perform a person-in-the-middle attack against VPN clients.
