- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Phoenix Hemodialysis device does not encrypt data in transit when transmitting treatment and prescription data over the network to the Exalis dialysis data management tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive data (CWE-319).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with unauthorized network access can observe sensitive treatment and prescription data being transmitted between the Phoenix system and the Exalis tool.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, specifically by monitoring network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have unauthorized access to the network where the Phoenix Hemodialysis device and the Exalis server are communicating. The attacker requires low skill level to exploit.
