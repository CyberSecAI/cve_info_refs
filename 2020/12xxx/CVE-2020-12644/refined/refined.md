  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The mail account API can be used to inject references to internal network topology when updating existing accounts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-side request forgery (CWE-918)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain insight into the internal network topology and configuration by observing responses and timings of network connections triggered by the injected references. This bypasses the existing blacklist.",
    "attack_vectors": "By injecting references to internal hosts in the mail account configuration via the mail account API.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a valid account to be able to add and modify external mail accounts, and make subsequent requests that trigger network connections."
