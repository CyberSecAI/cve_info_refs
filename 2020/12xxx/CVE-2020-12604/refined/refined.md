{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Envoy can consume and never release stream memory due to a scenario where it receives the final data of a stream from upstream but doesn't have enough open window to send the data downstream, leading to indefinite buffering.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial-of-service due to excessive memory consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack from an untrusted client opening multiple streams and requesting large responses while not opening the receive window."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an untrusted client with knowledge of backend configuration to craft a sequence of connections and streams to exploit the vulnerability. They must be capable of opening streams up to the `max_concurrent_streams` limit and requesting a resource that generates a large response."
  },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because data received from upstream, while waiting for downstream window, isn't covered by any timeout and is buffered indefinitely. The fix involves using `stream_idle_timeout` to cover the final data flush. If the downstream window isn't opened, the stream is reset, releasing the buffered data once the idle timeout is reached."
