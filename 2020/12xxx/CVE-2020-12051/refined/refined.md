Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12051:

*   **Vulnerability:** Information Leak
*   **Root Cause:** The `globaluserinfo` API in MediaWiki's CentralAuth extension was leaking information about hidden users. Even though the API noted that the account was missing or hidden, it still returned the account's `globaluserinfo`.
*   **Weakness:** The API did not properly check user access permissions before returning information, leading to unauthorized disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could query the `globaluserinfo` API to gather information about accounts that should have been hidden, potentially revealing sensitive details.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request to the `globaluserinfo` API with the username of a hidden account.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities are mentioned; the vulnerability was accessible to any user who could query the API.

The fix involved setting `$userExists` to `false` in `ApiQueryGlobalUserInfo::execute` when labeling the user as missing. This prevented the API from returning information about hidden users to unauthorized requesters.
