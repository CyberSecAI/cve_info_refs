Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12669:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `core/get_menudiv.php` file of Dolibarr. Specifically, the code uses `GETPOST('menu')` to retrieve the menu file name, but does not properly sanitize or validate the input.  It attempts to use the 'aZ09' filter but only for the second `GETPOST('menu')` call and not the first one. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values, including those with non-alphanumeric characters, into the `menu` parameter which is then used to load a menu file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Authorization:** The vulnerability allows bypassing intended access restrictions.
*   **Improper Input Validation:**  The code does not properly sanitize the `menu` parameter allowing malicious inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Access Restrictions**: By manipulating the 'menu' parameter, an attacker can load arbitrary files, potentially allowing access to restricted areas or functionalities, as well as executing arbitrary code by including external php files.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**: The CVSS score indicates high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This suggests that the vulnerability could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network**: The attack can be performed remotely.
*   **HTTP GET parameter manipulation**: By crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with a specially crafted `menu` parameter, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated access**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Dolibarr system with low level privileges.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter**: The attacker needs to know that the `menu` parameter is vulnerable and how to manipulate it.

**Additional notes:**

* The provided content includes a link to the commit that fixes the vulnerability which adds the 'aZ09' sanitization filter to the initial `GETPOST('menu')` call to prevent injection.
* The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.8.
* The vulnerability was fixed in Dolibarr version 12.0.0.
