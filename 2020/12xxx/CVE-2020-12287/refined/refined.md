- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect permissions in the Intel(R) Distribution of OpenVINO(TM) Toolkit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper file/directory permissions which allow for privilege escalation
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local user can escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user with local access. The user also needs to trigger the vulnerable code, which is specified by the 'User Interaction' field in the CVSS vector as 'Required' (UI:R)
