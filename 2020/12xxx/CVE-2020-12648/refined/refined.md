The provided content is related to CVE-2020-12648.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the stripping and sanitization logic of TinyMCE, which fails to properly handle nested and non-terminated HTML tags when used in classic editing mode. This flaw allows attackers to bypass the built-in XSS protections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied content. Specifically, nested and non-terminated HTML tags can be used to inject malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Information disclosure
*   Other context-dependent impacts, potentially account takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote and requires the ability to input crafted content into the TinyMCE editor. This can be achieved through:
*   Submitting a form with a crafted payload.
*   Using the `setContent` or `insertContent` functions of the TinyMCE editor with a crafted payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with a web application that uses the vulnerable version of TinyMCE (version 5.2.1 or earlier) and to supply malicious HTML content. The attacker must be able to submit this content into the editor either via a form or the TinyMCE API (like setContent or insertContent).
