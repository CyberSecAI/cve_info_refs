Package        : nss
Version        : 2:3.42.1-1+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-6829 CVE-2020-12400 CVE-2020-12401 CVE-2020-12403
                 CVE-2023-0767

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Network
Security Service libraries.

CVE-2020-6829

    When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point
    multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about
    the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace
    of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

CVE-2020-12400

    When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular
    inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible
    timing-based side channel attack.

CVE-2020-12401

    During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to
    ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in
    variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

CVE-2020-12403

    A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS.
    When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads.
    This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20
    (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length.

CVE-2023-0767

    Christian Holler discovered that incorrect handling of PKCS 12 Safe Bag
    attributes may result in execution of arbitrary code if a specially crafted
    PKCS 12 certificate bundle is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:3.42.1-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

Mail to security@ from Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya:

---

We recently dig into how the EC projective coordinates attack proposed in [1] could affect NSS.

The attack in [1] aims at recover some bits of the scalar starting from the projective representation

of an scalar multiplication output point.

Schemes like ECDSA are very sensitive to scalar leaks, therefore the attack in [1] can thwarts the security of an implementation if the attacker knows the projective representation of the product kG in ECDSA.

The success rate of the attack proposed in [1] depends on several factors such as:

* Elliptic curve form (Weierstrass, Montogmery, etc.)
* The finite field over the curve is defined
* Projective coordinates (Jacobian, Mxy, etc.)
* Scalar multiplication algorithm

making a high-demand time-consuming task to assess the real threat of this attack on implementation.

During our analysis to several cryptographic libraries we focused on NIST curve P-256 code paths and have found that your library is potentially vulnerable because the projective to affine coordinates conversion uses a side-channel vulnerable modular inversion function.

Considering the number of freedom degrees and potential threats we recommend to use one of the following countermeasures to prevent an already existing vulnerability or a future introduced one if one of the listed factors changes.

Countermeasures:

* Coordinates randomization after scalar multiplication but just before coordinates conversion takes place.
* Using FLT to invert Z instead of binary GCD based algorithms during coordinates conversion.

[1] - Naccache et al. - "Projective coordinates leak" - <https://eprint.iacr.org/2003/191>

The results of our research is going to be published at CHES.

If you wan't to assign a CVE, please let us know to include it a reference in the paper.

I made a copy-and-paste error in the report. Sorry for the noise!

P-256 code path is secure against this attack in NSS.

It uses FLT to compute the modular inversion of Z during the projective to affine coordinates conversion.

The issues relies in P-384 and P-521.

Where a side-channel insecure modular inversion algorithm is used.

JC: is this just a local side-channel, or something that could be detected over the internet somehow? Not sure how to rate the severity here.

I think the 256 bit curve on 64 bit is vulnerable as well. Only the 32 bit platforms have a special implementation. The quick and fix for this is to change ec\_GFp\_div() to use Fermat's Little Therom rather than or GCD invert function. The former is significantly slower (you calculate 1/x mod p = x^(p-1) mod p. Blinding is probably the better way to go. That would happend in jac code.

This is a duplicate of [Bug 1568061](/show_bug.cgi?id=1568061 "RESOLVED FIXED - side-channel leakage in ECDSA signature generation") and also related to [Bug 1387108](/show_bug.cgi?id=1387108 "RESOLVED FIXED - 8175110, CVE-2017-10118: Higher quality ECDSA operations") ([CVE-2017-10118](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-10118)).

The short of it is this is mostly a vulnerability for the server-side, and for an uncommon configuration (<1% of Firefox handshakes).

I'm resolving this as a duplicate, and we can continue the server-side discussions in the other two bugs.

Sorry, could you check the CVE? [CVE-2017-10118](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-10118) is related to Java SE.

I don't have access to the mentioned bug tracks, may I get access to them?

It would be nice for our research to know about previous works on this, thanks!

Regarding mostly server-side, take into account NSS is used by other projects as crypto backend (eg. libreswan VPN), where client auth are in place.

Alejandro - interesting, perhaps they redefined the CVE. It was never ours to begin with, but reported against Java and we got the notice that NSS had the same vulnerability. I'll add you to the other bugs in a moment.

jcj: thanks!

I read the descriptions and they are not the same.

We didn't exploit the non-constant time nature of wNAF nor Weierstrass incomplete formulae.

The potential threat resides in the coordinates conversion from projective to affine, that involves a side-channel insecure modular inversion function.

P-384 and P-521 code paths use a modular inversion algorithm based on the binary GCD algorithm.

while P-256 code path use an exponentiation with a non secret exponent (FLT) to compute the inverse.

This code path difference is what makes the P-384 and P-521 potentially exploitable while P-256 doesn't.

Only if you replace the insecure modular inversion function used to convert from projective coordinates.

Changing the scalar mult to a constant-time variant doesn't help.

Indeed.

Ben is currently keeping track of the EC replacements. Assigning to him for tracking.

Alejandro and team,

After some more digging here, I'd like to revise my earlier comments and request whether your team would be able to help us rewrite this modular inversion function. I had mistakenly believed that there was one constructed already by the HACL\* project, but there is not. As with the other patches, we are happy to and standing by to assist in review and test.

Thank you!

Absolutely. When we have the fix for [Bug 1631583](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631583 "RESOLVED FIXED - Side channel attack on ECDSA signature generation") (finally) ready, it will remove `mp_invmod` from this call stack anyway. But the [Bug 1631597](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631597 "RESOLVED FIXED - side channel vulnerabilities during RSA key generation") fix should make `mp_invmod` CT so everybody wins :)

Stay tuned and yea we'll appreciate the testing help when my team gets there.

Our tooling [ECCKiila](https://gitlab.com/nisec/ecckiila) is now public.

We stripped out the NSS rigging and instructions for now, to respect the embargo. (It's questionable if that was necessary, but I acted conservatively.)

The code you are seeing in these revisions is exactly the output from that tooling, just post-processed with `unifdef` like the instructions say. I used this oneliner

```
export CURVES="secp256r1 secp384r1 secp521r1"
for c in $CURVES; do unifdef ecp/$c/ecp_$c.c -URIG_GOST -DRIG_NSS -UOPENSSL_BUILDING_OPENSSL -ULIB_TEST > /path/to/libnss/nss/lib/freebl/ecl/ecp_$c.c; done

It's not clear to me from this bug what type of side channel this was - I'm guessing timing? If it's a power analysis attack or something, or you think the advisory can be improved or the credit is incorrect please let me know.

Hey Tom,

A few suggestions below, if it's not too late. It was a page fault attack (although def power analysis would've been an option for us), but without getting too technical for a high level advisory, maybe stressing it's a local attack vector like below is sufficient.

BBB

### Byline

Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, Cesar Pereida García, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland

### Channel

When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible local microarchitecture attack.

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-36

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 80

Announced
August 25, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 80

#### [#CVE-2020-15663: Downgrade attack on the Mozilla Maintenance Service could have resulted in escalation of privilege](#CVE-2020-15663)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu
Impact
high
##### Description

If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla Maintenance Service would execute updater.exe from the install location with administrative privileges. Although the Mozilla Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version could have been rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of an older bug and arbitrary code execution with system privileges.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1643199](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1643199)

#### [#CVE-2020-15664: Attacker-induced prompt for extension installation](#CVE-2020-15664)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
high
##### Description

By holding a reference to the `eval()` function from an about:blank window, a malicious webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result in an unintended or malicious extension being installed.

#### [#CVE-2020-12401: Timing-attack on ECDSA signature generation](#CVE-2020-12401)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

##### References

* [Bug 1631573](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631573)

#### [#CVE-2020-6829: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to an electro-magnetic side channel attack on signature generation](#CVE-2020-6829)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

##### References

* [Bug 1631583](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631583)

#### [#CVE-2020-12400: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to a side channel attack on modular inversion](#CVE-2020-12400)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-15665: Address bar not reset when choosing to stay on a page after the beforeunload dialog is shown](#CVE-2020-15665)

Reporter
Luan Herrera
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not reset the address bar after the beforeunload dialog was shown if the user chose to remain on the page. This could have resulted in an incorrect URL being shown when used in conjunction with other unexpected browser behaviors.

##### References

* [Bug 1651636](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651636)

#### [#CVE-2020-15666: MediaError message property leaks cross-origin response status](#CVE-2020-15666)

Reporter
Gunes Acar
Impact
low
##### Description

When trying to load a non-video in an audio/video context the exact status code (200, 302, 404, 500, 412, 403, etc.) was disclosed via the MediaError Message. This level of information leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks.

* [Bug 1450853](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1450853)

#### [#CVE-2020-15667: Heap overflow when processing an update file](#CVE-2020-15667)

Reporter
crixer
Impact
low
##### Description

When processing a MAR update file, after the signature has been validated, an invalid name length could result in a heap overflow, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution. Within Firefox as released by Mozilla, this issue is only exploitable with the Mozilla-controlled signing key.

##### References

* [Bug 1653371](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1653371)

#### [#CVE-2020-15668: Data Race when reading certificate information](#CVE-2020-15668)

Reporter
Tyson Smith
Impact
low
##### Description

A lock was missing when accessing a data structure and importing certificate information into the trust database.

#### [#CVE-2020-15670: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2](#CVE-2020-15670)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 79 and Firefox ESR 78.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox for Android 80

Announced
September 2, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox for Android
Fixed in

* Firefox for Android 80

#### [#CVE-2020-15664: Attacker-induced prompt for extension installation](#CVE-2020-15664)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
high
##### Description

By holding a reference to the `eval()` function from an about:blank window, a malicious webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result in an unintended or malicious extension being installed.

* [Bug 1658214](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658214)

#### [#CVE-2020-12401: Timing-attack on ECDSA signature generation](#CVE-2020-12401)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in variable-time execution dependent on secret data.

##### References

* [Bug 1631573](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631573)

#### [#CVE-2020-6829: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to an electro-magnetic side channel attack on signature generation](#CVE-2020-6829)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed.

* [Bug 1631583](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631583)

#### [#CVE-2020-12400: P-384 and P-521 vulnerable to a side channel attack on modular inversion](#CVE-2020-12400)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1623116](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1623116)

#### [#CVE-2020-15666: MediaError message property leaks cross-origin response status](#CVE-2020-15666)

Reporter
Gunes Acar
Impact
low
##### Description

When trying to load a non-video in an audio/video context the exact status code (200, 302, 404, 500, 412, 403, etc.) was disclosed via the MediaError Message. This level of information leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks.

* [Bug 1450853](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1450853)

#### [#CVE-2020-15668: Data Race when reading certificate information](#CVE-2020-15668)

Reporter
Tyson Smith
Impact
low
##### Description

A lock was missing when accessing a data structure and importing certificate information into the trust database.

##### References

* [Bug 1651520](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651520)

#### [#CVE-2020-15671: Passwords could be saved to phone keyboard dictionary](#CVE-2020-15671)

Reporter
Karol Frejlich
Impact
low
##### Description

When typing in a password under certain conditions, a race may have occured where the InputContext was not being correctly set for the input field, resulting in the typed passwod being saved to the keyboard dictionary.

##### References

* [Bug 1653862](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1653862)

#### [#CVE-2020-15670: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox for Android 80](#CVE-2020-15670)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox for Android 79. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

[filed from mail to security@ from Sohaib ul Hassan]

Hey Folks!

We are a team of security researchers from Tampere University, Finland.

We have discovered a vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation that

enables us to exfiltrate information from various side channels and

recover the private key.

# Vulnerable function

The vulnerability is found in the non-constant time ECC scalar

multiplication function ec\_GFp\_pt\_mul\_jm\_wNAF @

lib/freebl/ecl/ecp\_jm.cecp\_jm.c. This code path is executed when

either NIST\_P384 or NIST\_P521 EC curve is selected. The wNAF scalar

multiplication computes EC point doubling (ec\_GFp\_pt\_dbl\_jm) at each

iteration, with a conditional branch depending on non-zero scalar

digits, which computes an EC point addition (ec\_GFp\_pt\_add\_jm\_aff).

In general, wNAF point multiplication algorithm is known to be

vulnerable, and successfully targeted in the past e.g. in OpenSSL

ECDSA with L1 cache timings [4], LLC cache timings [3],

ElectroMagnetic emanations (EM) [2], and port contention [1].

Using the EM side-channel, we successfully extracted the position of

zero and non-zero wNAF digits while nss-certutil tool performed scalar

multiplication during the ECDSA signature generation, leaking partial

information about the ECDSA nonce. Given a small number of ECDSA

signatures, this information can be used to steal the private key.

Attached with this report, an EM trace which clearly reveals the

position of point doubling and additions.

We used the EM channel for simplicity, but also achieved success with

various other SW-based channels, including but not limited to timing.

Additionally and related to ECDSA signature generation, we also

exploited using a software controlled side-channel attack the wNAF

encoding function ec\_compute\_wNAF @ lib/freebl/ecl/ec\_naf.c. We were

able to recover the wNAF encoding of the scalar using a single trace.

# Fix

Replace the non-constant time wNAF calls with a constant time

implementation. Our team is willing to help with the fix.

# Disclosure

We are planning for a public disclosure on May 18. But this embargo

date is also up for discussion.

Thank you and your whole research group for this collection of reports. This comment is being added to each.

I’m assigning each of these to a team member for more detailed analysis beyond our initial triage. As all of these affect RHEL, I am also requesting impact analysis from our RedHat peers as well, as even if a side-channel is local, that might indicate higher-severity for server software than for Firefox. The analysis will also determine how to allocate CVE numbers, as needed.

I would like to advise that the embargo period your team has initially indicated is quite short, and in this case conflicts with both RedHat and Firefox release cycles. For a bug being actively exploited, we can do what is necessary; in the general case, our Release Calendar [0] indicates that to meet a 18 May disclosure date, we would need to make and uplift a point release of NSS from Nightly to Firefox Beta 76 within 8 days, which, given the complexity involved, seems unrealistic - and moreso for all four bugs at once. We’ll have a better idea as we complete our analysis of each bug.

Again, thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. Research such as yours makes the whole world safer!

Sohaib and team,

We’ve been alerted to the existence of <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432.pdf>, so it appears the issue is already publicly disclosed. Luckily, < 0.1% of Firefox beta telemetry are p384 and p521 [0]. Unfortunately, this is likely a serious issue for RedHat, as I expect they are more likely to have customers using the larger curves.

Sohaib: Are there plans for imminent disclosure for any of the other issues?

Dan: Since there’s now a spotlight pointed at this, we’re definitely going to need a CVE for RedHat’s management.

Bob, RedHat: Heads-up.

For clarification, you might be misreading Table 1 in eprint:2020:432. It is saying NSS is threatened to do the use of BEEA during projective to affine point conversion. The paper is (mostly) unrelated to the "Scalar Multiplication" column, and does not mention wNAF elsewhere in the paper. (Or even define what it is.)

Our proposed fix for this is, similar to the P-256 code in NSS, a custom `ECGroupStr` for P-384 and P-521 with formally verified and constant time code. My team is happy to assist with that, especially since it is a non-trivial change. (Patching wNAF is a waste of time and effort.)

Thanks. We agree that moving to a non-wNAF and constant-time algorithm is the best direction here. That algorithm could be either generic or specific for these two curves.

We would be happy to review and accept a patch (as well as lend assistance with any NSS-specific questions that come up), but if you already have a CT/FV implementation in mind, we can also take on the work of incorporating it into NSS. Let us know how you’d like to proceed.

Public tooling can give us the CT/FV for the GFp layer, but the EC layer and rigging is missing.

I have a pair of researchers working on automating all of this -- the focus there is for OpenSSL but since the EC bits of NSS and OpenSSL were forked from the same source 20 years ago I'm guessing it's not that hard to tweak our tooling output.

And it is somehow easier for NSS since we're only talking about 2 curves here. (cf. like 50 in OpenSSL.) NSS has done a good job of narrowing their attack surface in that sense.

So give us some time and we'll come to you when we have a working implementation. This will take several weeks but we will keep you posted.

I mentioned on another thread (likely buried somewhere) we can **push the embargo date** on all my team's work (#1631576 #1631573 #1631583 #1631597) to at least **02 June**.

Let's take the time to get the fixes in right. I've been fixing and re-fixing OpenSSL now for over a decade, so I feel like I know exactly what *not* to do. (e.g. push out half baked patches and one-liner crutch fixes, punting the problem to other parts of the library.)

Seems like a CVE has already been assigned to this issue, i can assign CVEs if you want, but isnt Mozilla already a CNA?

Also since the paper is already published, should'nt we consider this issue as already public?

Quick update. We are making progress. We have the formally verified GF layer, and at least a first go at an EC layer. We are working essentially on lots of glue -- between the GF layer to the EC layer, and the EC layer to NSS rigging. I hope to have at least something initial to show within a week or so.

(This is for P-384 and P-521.)

Huzaifa: Sorry for the delay in responding here. There's already a CVE assigned, as you see, but this issue is not public. The paper points to this function, but doesn't reference this particular vulnerability.

Update: our internal unit tests for P-384 and P-521 are now passing. It means one side of the rigging is now done (our own EC layer to fiat's GF layer). So all that's left is

1. More performance optimization of the EC layer
2. NSS rigging

So when we understand the performance tradeoffs more, we'll come to you with a patch.

Right now the code is 64-bit only because it uses the `__int128` type. (And possibly gcc/clang only? I don't know.)

FIAT has 32-bit flavors too that we can likely `ifdef` at compile time, but we don't have that rigged in yet.

Any hints / expectations here in terms of portability, architecture, and required compilers?

My team is a Linux-only shop so anything that isn't gcc or clang we can't sign up for. Cross-architecture is fine -- x64, x32, aarch64, armv7, even maybe mips32 we can test. But yea Linux-only. So we need your help there testing wise since I reckon you support lots of OSs.

Tampere University team,

I realize I haven’t replied to your specific questions here, so let me do that as best I can:

> Any hints / expectations here in terms of portability, architecture, and required compilers?

NSS is pretty cross-platform, but the way we’re approaching all of these patches so far is going to be pretty much the same. As we’re doing with the patch for [CVE-2020-12402](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-12402), we’ll test on all our tier-1 platforms and compilers as part of the review process, but basically that’s every line depicted here — particularly expand the `Builds (+5)` portions to see clang (4) and gcc versions (4.4+). But we’ll help adapt the patches and ensure support.

We can also help with the 32-bit compile-time work with the Fiat code, if you want to post a work-in-progress patch (`moz-phab submit --wip`).

(As something of a reminder to myself, when we do land fiat crypto code, I need to patch Firefox’s `about:license` to include its license)

Finally, I'm marking 68 ESR as wontfix, since this Firefox's perspective this is more of a sec-moderate and so not a typical ESR candidate.

Great thanks JC.

The code is pretty much ready. I'm confident I'll be able to submit a patch tomorrow. The performance looks very good. Just a small issue to solve on big endian platforms.

For P-384, you'll get both 64-bit and 32-bit portable versions.

Unfortunately for P-521, we can only deliver the 64-bit portable version. The reason is a combination of Fiat limitations and 521 being not on a word boundary.

What I can do is: promise to deliver the 32-bit version if and when Fiat supports that field. All the code is 100% machine generated so when that happens, it's less than a 5min job.

So ... I did the submission with `moz-phab` (I think). Some notes:

* The `ecp_secp384r1.c` file is 100% computer generated.
* For review, try to ignore anything between `/* BEGIN verbatim fiat code */` and `/* END verbatim fiat code */`
* Everything from `static void fe_inv_secp384r1` up to `static void precomp_rdx` is also computer generated like everything else, but with high confidence because we did not hand write the ECC arith formulas or inversion -- they are auto generated from EFD format.
* So for review, try to focus on `static void precomp_rdx` up to and including `mp_err ec_group_set_secp384r1`. In particular, the NSS rigging starts at `#include "mplogic.h"`.
* I need to add some kind of license notice

Here's the numbers for my super crappy laptop, `clang-10` 64-bit build.

We've already started the review, which we plan to complete by the middle of next week (~24 June). For scheduling purposes, is there any ETA on the 64-bit P521 patch?

Numbers from the paper attached. Bottom 2 rows are relevant for NSS. Numbers look pretty good.

You're derive is slower because you're doing *explicit* point validation:

1. Checking nP = inf
2. Finally calculating the shared kP

So two scalar multiplications. That made sense when NSS supported a bunch of random curves, but not anymore. Since these are prime-order curves, verifying points satisfy the curve equation is enough so you can do away with (1) above.

It is easy to add that logic to the templating, adding a fourth function pointer. But I haven't yet.

I think it's there as a FIPS requirement to prevent small sub-group attacks. I'd have to check with the lab to verify that it's redundant if y is on the curve and the curve is in a prime field.

RE: machine generated code. I'm OK with that as long as the tool which generated it (and the source input to that tool) is available. (We don't need to rerun it at build time, but we would want users to be able to regenerate their own .c files for the paranoid.

Hey Bob,

Absolutely it's a FIPS requirement. But if the point satisfies the curve equation, and the curve has prime-order, it's guaranteed to be order-n. That's a group theory constraint.

All of our tooling will be open sourced as soon as we clean up stuff, and we wanted to wait until embargoes expire.

If you want "early access", just give me a GitLab username and I'm happy to grant access.

PS I'm not sure the paper describing this code generation helps with review, but I'm also happy to share that if you want nitty gritty academic research details. NSS was only a very small part of the work here (on the mathematically "boring" end since these are extremely legacy curves), as you can see from the table. (Nevertheless, we are very happy to have it in scope.)

OK, I will check with the lab, but I think a check that the curve is prime-order (out of paranoia) and skipping the test in that case would be fine.

We don't need early access, if the tools are available "soon" after embargo, that is fine.

bbrumley, regarding this bug, [Bug 1631573](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631573 "RESOLVED FIXED - ECDSA Timing Countermeasure Bypass"), and [Bug 1623116](/show_bug.cgi?id=1623116 "RESOLVED FIXED - P-384 and P-521 implementation uses a side-channel vulnerable modular inversion function"):

Could we re-target the disclosure dates out one more release cycle, to 2020-07-28 (Firefox 79)? I know my team has started reviews of this bug's attached patches, and I apologize that we don't have further comments posted yet, but we'll be on that alongside getting this week's release of NSS 3.54 out.

Thanks!

Hey JC,

> Could we re-target the disclosure dates out one more release cycle, to 2020-07-28 (Firefox 79)? I know my team has started reviews of this bug's attached patches, and I apologize that we don't have further comments posted yet, but we'll be on that alongside getting this week's release of NSS 3.54 out.

Yea let's re-target. It's a lot of code and we didn't exactly deliver in a timely fashion. Let's take the time to do the fix right.

In the meantime, we even have some performance improvements with our tooling. But I guess that's not the main point here, and when the tooling is public I hope we can provide improvements seamlessly from our upstream tooling.

Slightly better numbers for P-384:

```
Testing NIST-P384 using freebl implementation...
    ECDH_Derive     count: 100 sec: 0.15 op/sec: 651.02
    ECDSA_Sign      count: 100 sec: 0.02 op/sec: 4013.16
        ECDHE max rate = 1166.05
    ECDSA_Verify    count: 100 sec: 0.09 op/sec: 1151.07
... okay.

```

I guess the P-521 numbers are pretty good too:

## Before

```
Testing NIST-P521 using freebl implementation...
    ECDH_Derive     count: 100 sec: 0.29 op/sec: 345.72
    ECDSA_Sign      count: 100 sec: 0.16 op/sec: 623.53
        ECDHE max rate = 242.31
    ECDSA_Verify    count: 100 sec: 0.25 op/sec: 402.94
... okay.

```
## After

```
Testing NIST-P521 using freebl implementation...
    ECDH_Derive     count: 100 sec: 0.17 op/sec: 605.66
    ECDSA_Sign      count: 100 sec: 0.05 op/sec: 1998.28
        ECDHE max rate = 650.99
    ECDSA_Verify    count: 100 sec: 0.11 op/sec: 927.28
... okay.

```

**But more importantly:** we were able to get the 32-bit Fiat code working for P-521! So this gives you complete coverage for the fix :)

I have no Idea if I'm doing this revision thing correctly. In the git universe this would be fixup commits pushed to the PR branch ... *shrug* pls advise if I'm mucking things up.

I added P-256 for consistency, if you're interested.

re [comment 38](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631583#c38 "RESOLVED FIXED - Side channel attack on ECDSA signature generation"): I'm not seeing any potential endian issues. The code seems to treat everything as uint64's or uint128's. I wonder if arm is doing the right thing when multiplying a 128bit value(which is a 64 bit casted to 128 bit) by a 64 bit value and getting the correct 128 bit value

I think we got it. `char` defaults to unsigned on arm but signed on x86/x64. Checking the fixes now.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Medium difficulty.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: It's not risky, but I'm not sure if we want to do this into an ESR this release, or maybe include in a future ESR update.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Moderate possibility, but we'd see the issues pretty rapidly when it gets into Beta.

bbrumley: We are ready to land P384/P521, but I noticed that the summaries are all blank. Would you like to provide one, including any credit to you and your team? If not, that's fine too.

Thanks!

Great!

Oh, right. Sure -- anything similar to below is fine :)

P384 and P521 landed:

<https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/d19a3cd451bbf9602672fdbba8d6a817a55bfc69>

Regarding the P256 patch, the 32-bit performance takes a ~30-50% hit over the existing implementation. We're still interested in taking it, but need to do some investigation into what kind of impact that would have on Firefox, particularly on mobile devices. Maybe some optimizations are possible. We have an in-progress patch to bring in 64-bit HACL\* P256, but will certainly benchmark it against the 64-bit Fiat code.

I'm going to mark this bug resolved and for now, link it to [bug 1653364](/show_bug.cgi?id=1653364 "RESOLVED WONTFIX") so that we can circle back on the last patch.

Thanks again for these contributions!

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
