{
  "CVE-2020-12400": {
    "description": "When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack.",
    "root_cause": "The modular inversion algorithm used during projective to affine coordinate conversion was based on the binary GCD algorithm, which is not constant-time.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing-based side channel vulnerability",
      "Non-constant time execution of modular inversion"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive data via timing information, potentially leading to private key recovery.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Timing side channel attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have the ability to measure the execution time of the modular inversion operation (local microarchitecture attack). This could be from an adjacent process or through shared hardware."
