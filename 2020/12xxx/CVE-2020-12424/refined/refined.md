Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-12424:

**CVE-2020-12424**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how the WebRTC permission prompt was constructed. The URI used to construct the prompt was supplied by the content process and not verified by the parent process. This untrusted URI could potentially be manipulated by a compromised content process to match a previously granted origin, thus bypassing the prompt.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Lack of proper sanitization/verification of the URI provided by the content process.
    *   Reliance on untrusted input for security decisions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A compromised content process could bypass the WebRTC permission prompt, potentially allowing unauthorized access to WebRTC functionality such as camera and microphone.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious or compromised website/content can manipulate the URI provided during the construction of the WebRTC permission prompt.
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited through network-based attacks by serving the malicious content to a vulnerable client.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to compromise a content process, which often involves injecting malicious code into a website being viewed by a victim.
    *   Ability to serve content that triggers the vulnerable WebRTC functionality (e.g., a webpage attempting to access the camera or microphone).
