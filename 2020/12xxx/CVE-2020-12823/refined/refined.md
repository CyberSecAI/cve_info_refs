{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-12823",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `get_cert_name` function within the `gnutls.c` file of OpenConnect.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The buffer overflow can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts.  Specifically, the stack can be corrupted leading to a crash. The vulnerability could also potentially allow arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a crafted certificate presented by the VPN server.",
         "The attack vector is through crafted certificate data provided by the VPN server, which is then processed by `get_cert_name` function."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the certificate data sent by the VPN server."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "net-vpn/openconnect versions before 8.09-r1 on Gentoo",
    "openSUSE Leap 15.2",
    "Debian 8 \"Jessie\" before version 6.00-2+deb8u2",
    "SUSE Linux Enterprise products",
    "Fedora 30, 31, and 32"
  ],
  "patches": [
    "Upgrade net-vpn/openconnect to version 8.09-r1 or later on Gentoo.",
    "Apply the openSUSE security update.",
      "Upgrade to openconnect 6.00-2+deb8u2 or later on Debian 8 \"Jessie\".",
        "Apply the SUSE security advisories.",
        "Upgrade to openconnect 8.10-1.fc30 on Fedora 30, 8.10-1.fc31 on Fedora 31, or 8.10-1.fc32 on Fedora 32."
  ],
  "details": "The vulnerability occurs because the `gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid` function may update the provided buffer size if the buffer is not large enough to store the data. If the function updates the size parameter beyond what is allocated, a buffer overflow occurs. In `get_cert_name`, this leads to a write past the end of the allocated buffer, due to incrementing the size of the buffer via the gnutls function, and then using that size when writing to it. The fix involves avoiding the clobbering the `namelen` variable and using a temporary variable."
