The test suite for ocserv calls openconnect with a certificate that has
a name that is 84 bytes in length. The buffer passed to get\_cert\_name is
currently 80 bytes.

The `gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid` function will update the buffer size
parameter if the buffer is too small.

<http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid.3.html>

> ```
> RETURNS
>        GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not long
>        enough, and in that case the  buf_size will be updated with the
>        required size. GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE if there are no
>        data in the current index. On success 0 is returned.
> ```

Use a temporary variable to avoid clobbering the `namelen` variable that is
passed to `get_cert_name`.

Package        : openconnect
Version        : 6.00-2+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12823
Debian Bug     : 960620

OpenConnect, a VPN software, had a buffer overflow, causing a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact, via
crafted certificate data to get_cert_name in gnutls.c.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
6.00-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openconnect packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](#c0)  Dorian Pula    2004-11-20 20:29:51 UTC  ``` Would be nice to have the subclipse plugin, as part of portage's packages.  Needs javahl, subversion 1.x and eclipse 2.1 or 3.0  Please...  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Karl Trygve Kalleberg (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-24 08:07:50 UTC  ``` We certainly don't have time to do this ourselves, but if somebody external to the project agrees to submit and maintain such an ebuild, we would be interested.  In the meantime, I suggest you add the subclipse plugin to you Update Manager inside of Eclipse.  I'm closing as NEEDINFO, the info being an actual ebuild;) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Paul de Vrieze (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-24 11:41:34 UTC  ``` I agree, I have tried the subclipse plugin. The java-hl bindings do not work without extra magic (LD_LIBRARY_PATH stuff). The bindings to the command line application are still "alpha" according to the application. Further one can now easilly use the update manager even at user level. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  James Le Cuirot   gentoo-dev  2005-01-08 07:12:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 47939](attachment.cgi?id=47939 "subclipse-bin-0.9.25.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=47939&action=edit "subclipse-bin-0.9.25.ebuild")] subclipse-bin-0.9.25.ebuild  And here is that ebuild! It's a binary version but hey. It doesn't need any fiddling with LD_LIBRARY_PATH to make java-hl work. I haven't actually tried using it yet because I haven't used Subversion for years and I don't have any content to play with yet but it should work. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Karl Trygve Kalleberg (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-12 15:17:08 UTC  ``` In my experience, this works easily through the Update Manager. If the ebuild was from-source, we'd include it. As it is, I don't see how this adds any value for the Eclipse user on Gentoo, I'm afraid.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Paul de Vrieze (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-13 08:49:41 UTC  ``` The library path stuff is from later versions. Maybe it is usefull to indicate that for the update manager it is possible to create additional plugin locations. As such not needing to install things as root. ``` |  |

Resorting to tracking who stack canary on stack.  Before looking at the specifics here is how stack canary usually looks like on arm64:    // cat a.c   void g(const char *);   void f(void)   {      char b[128];      g(b);   }  $ aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -O2 -c -S a.c; cat a.s   ...   f: 	stp	x29, x30, [sp, -176]! 	mov	x29, sp 	str	x19, [sp, 16] 	adrp	x19, :got:__stack_chk_guard 	add	x0, sp, 40 	ldr	x19, [x19, #:got_lo12:__stack_chk_guard] 	ldr	x1, [x19] 	str	x1, [sp, 168] 	mov	x1,0  	bl	g  	ldr	x1, [sp, 168] 	ldr	x0, [x19] 	eor	x0, x1, x0 	cbnz	x0, .L5 	ldr	x19, [sp, 16] 	ldp	x29, x30, [sp], 176 	ret .L5: 	bl	__stack_chk_fail  It's a very verbose way to: - load value by '__stack_chk_guard' absolute address into 'x19' register - store canary copy on stack at '[sp +168]' address - restore canary from stack and from address at 'x19' and compare it back.  A good hint here is that right after the store 'x1' value is zeroed out with 'mov x1,0'.  Let's track life of a canary in 'load_certificate' and see where it gets corrupted:  I added 'gdb --args' to openconnect call in test-pass-group-cert-no-pass and removed a few unused evals.
