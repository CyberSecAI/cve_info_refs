Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of authentication for multiple web pages that expose sensitive system information intended for internal use. These pages are automatically queried by the devices for dashboard updates, but they are also externally accessible without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive system information through unauthenticated web pages.
- **Missing Access Control:** The lack of authentication mechanisms for these pages allows anyone with network access to retrieve the information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can access a wide range of sensitive information about the device, including:
    - Interface status logs
    - IP address
    - MAC address
    - Model and firmware version
    - Location
    - Running processes
    - Interface statuses
    - DHCP leases and hostnames
    - Nearby wireless networks
    - Memory statistics
    - Device configuration details (including enabled features).
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosed information can be used to facilitate other attacks, such as gaining access to the device's management interface using disclosed credentials or leveraging other vulnerabilities after reconnaissance.
- **Compromise of Network Security:** Exposure of device and network details could allow an attacker to map the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** The attack vector is simply accessing the vulnerable web pages directly via HTTP requests. The pages follow a predictable naming pattern `live_(string).shtml`, making them easily discoverable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the affected devices. This could be from the local network or, depending on the network configuration, from the internet.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to send HTTP requests to access the unauthenticated pages.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple Wavlink devices, including  Wavlink WN530HG4, Wavlink WN575A3, Wavlink WN579G3,Wavlink WN531G3, Wavlink WN533A8, Wavlink WN531A6, Wavlink WN551K1, Wavlink WN535G3, Wavlink WN530H4, Wavlink WN57X93, WN572HG3, Wavlink WN578A2, Wavlink WN579G3, Wavlink WN579X3, and Jetstream AC3000/ERAC3000.
- The vendor did not respond to attempts to communicate the vulnerability.
- The configuration backup function is also unauthenticated in some devices, allowing the retrieval of the device's configuration file including plain text credentials.
