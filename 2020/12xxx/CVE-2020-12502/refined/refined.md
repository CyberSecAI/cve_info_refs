Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The web interface used for configuring the affected devices lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The web interface does not implement proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can change device settings by tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website. This includes actions such as modifying network settings, uploading configuration files, and potentially more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker creates a website that includes malicious HTML form that targets the device's web interface.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker lures a logged-in user of the affected device's web interface to visit this malicious site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the device.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user of the device's web interface to visit the malicious website while the user is logged in.
*   **Knowledge of the device:** The attacker must have knowledge about the vulnerable web interface endpoints and parameters to construct the malicious requests.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how a malicious website can be crafted to send a ping command to the device, demonstrating that the attacker can perform actions through CSRF. This PoC targets the `/goform/formping` endpoint with the `PingIPAddress`, `submit-url`, and `Submit` parameters.
*   The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper CSRF token verification.
*   The attacker leverages the user's active session to perform actions on the device.

**Affected Products:**

The vulnerability is present in multiple Korenix JetNet series devices, Westermo PMI-110-F2G, and Pepperl+Fuchs Comtrol RocketLinx series.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor recommends updating to the latest firmware version, which likely includes CSRF protection.
*   Other recommendations include restricting network access and using firewall configurations, which do not address this specific vulnerability, but improve overall security.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability allows changing settings in the device web interface, and the specific PoC demonstrates changing the device's ping settings via the `goform/formping` endpoint.
*   This vulnerability is often chained with other vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by the "Semi-Blind Authenticated Command Injection" (CVE-2020-12503) which is exploitable due to the lack of CSRF protection.

This analysis provides a detailed understanding of the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-12502) affecting the mentioned devices and their web interface.
