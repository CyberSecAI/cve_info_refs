### @mo-bl **[mo-bl](/mo-bl)** commented [Oct 12, 2021](#issue-1023715052)

This PR fixes a buffer overflow in the BLE L2CAP credit-based flow control.

The overflow occurs in the `input_l2cap_frame_flow_channel` function, as an adversary is able to control the amount of data copied by memcpy ([source](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/release/v4.4/os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c#L424)).

To fix this issue I suggest to:

* Add a condition for the first fragment that checks, whether the received `payload_len` is larger than `BLE_L2CAP_NODE_MTU`, which is the length of the destination array.
* Add an integer overflow resistant condition for the subsequent fragments that checks, whether the sum of the received `payload_len` of the current fragment and the `current_index` of the `rx_buffer` is larger than `BLE_L2CAP_NODE_MTU`, which is the length of the destination array.

In both cases illegal frames are simply dropped.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Oct 22, 2021](#issuecomment-949408446)

| Thanks for the fix, which checks that the destination buffer has enough space. While inspecting the code, it appears that it lacks more checks on length values extracted from input packets. This includes the `frame_len` (which should be checked against the available source data length `data_len`) and the `channel->rx_buffer.sdu_length` values. It is not necessary to fix it in this pull request, however. |
