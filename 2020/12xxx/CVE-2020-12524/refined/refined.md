- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. The HMI devices do not properly handle a rapid flood of network packets like ICMP pings, leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The devices are vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), specifically when flooded with ICMP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, where the HMI becomes unresponsive, no longer accepts user input, and fails to update the display content.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a network by sending a flood of ICMP ping packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. No specific authentication or privileges are required. The attacker can be on the same network or have network access to the HMI device.
