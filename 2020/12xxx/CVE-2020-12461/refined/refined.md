Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a second-order blind SQL injection vulnerability present in the `ORDER BY` clause of a SQL query within the "Shitter" web application. User-supplied data, specifically the chosen post order preference, is stored in a server-signed cookie. This value is then directly inserted into the `ORDER BY` clause without proper sanitization or escaping, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Second-Order SQL Injection:** The injection point is not directly from user input but via stored data, making it a second-order vulnerability.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Direct output from the database is not displayed, requiring the attacker to infer results using timing or ordering changes.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** User-controlled input is directly placed into the SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing arbitrary SQL code execution.
*   **Vulnerable ORDER BY clause**: The injection point is within the `ORDER BY` clause, which limits the usual `UNION`-based SQL injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can exfiltrate sensitive information from the database by exploiting the blind SQL injection vulnerability. In this case, the attacker is able to leak the admin password hash by using a series of SQL queries to determine characters using `REGEXP` and `CASE` statements.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not detailed, this could potentially lead to further exploitation depending on the database setup, and the permissions granted to the database user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Server-Signed Cookie:** The attacker modifies the "order" value in the cookie with malicious SQL code.
*   **Request to Settings Page:** The attacker sends a request to the settings page, triggering the application to update the user's cookie with the injected SQL code.
*   **Triggering SQL query:** The attacker loads a profile page causing the server to execute the SQL query containing the injected SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server, including the ability to manipulate cookies.
*   **Understanding of SQL and SQL injection:** The attacker must have an understanding of SQL, especially `CASE` statements, `REGEXP` operators, and blind SQL injection techniques, to craft working payloads.
*   **Access to the web application:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable web application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker leverages the `CASE` statement within the `ORDER BY` clause to conditionally sort posts based on the result of a subquery containing `EXISTS` and `REGEXP`.
*   The `REGEXP` operator is used to perform character-by-character bruteforcing of the desired information (e.g., the admin's password hash).
*   By observing the order of the posts (either sorted by creation time or content), the attacker can determine if the regular expression matched.
*   A Python script is used to automate the process of sending requests, analyzing responses, and building the leaked information.
*   The attacker found that by not handling errors properly, the web application displays verbose error messages when an invalid query is run that contain the output of the injection, allowing an alternative method of extraction.
*   The attacker uses the `BINARY` keyword for case sensitive matches.
