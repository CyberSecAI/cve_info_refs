Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-12398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Thunderbird handles the STARTTLS command for IMAP connections. Specifically, if the IMAP server responds with a PREAUTH response after STARTTLS is initiated, Thunderbird incorrectly proceeds with an unencrypted connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Security Downgrade: The vulnerability results in a security downgrade, transitioning from an encrypted connection (TLS) to an unencrypted one.
- Lack of Proper Handling of PREAUTH response: Thunderbird fails to handle the PREAUTH response correctly in the STARTTLS context, leading to the unencrypted connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leakage: Because the connection falls back to an unencrypted state, email data, including usernames, passwords, and email content, is transmitted without encryption, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attack: A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform a MITM attack, capturing sensitive information during the unencrypted communication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is conducted over a network connection to an IMAP server.
- Malicious IMAP Server: An attacker controls or manipulates the IMAP server to send the PREAUTH response after the STARTTLS command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Man-in-the-middle position or control over an IMAP server: The attacker needs the ability to either intercept network traffic or control the IMAP server to send the malicious PREAUTH response.
- Knowledge of client configuration: The attacker relies on the Thunderbird client being configured to use STARTTLS for IMAP.
