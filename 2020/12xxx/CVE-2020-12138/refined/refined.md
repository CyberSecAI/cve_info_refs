Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `atillk64.sys` driver, an ATI Technologies Inc. driver used for hardware diagnostics and configuration.
*   The driver allows low-privileged users to interact with it, enabling them to manipulate physical memory.
*   The core issue stems from the driver's use of `MmMapIoSpace` to map physical memory into system memory and then into user-space without proper validation and restrictions, allowing a low privileged user to read/write arbitrary physical memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Physical Memory Access:** The driver directly maps physical memory into user space. This memory can contain sensitive kernel data.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver does not properly validate the physical address and length parameters passed to `MmMapIoSpace`, which enables attacker-controlled read/write operations to physical memory.
*  **Use of Deprecated API:** The driver utilizes the deprecated API `MmMapLockedPages`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
*   **Arbitrary Kernel Access:** By reading from and writing to kernel memory, attackers can bypass security controls, achieve code execution in kernel space, and modify system behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target machine.
*   **Driver Interaction:** The attack involves interacting with the vulnerable `atillk64.sys` driver through `DeviceIoControl` calls, which allows control of the physical memory address and length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User Access:** The attacker only needs to have low-privileged user access to the system.
*   **Ability to Interact with Driver:** The attacker needs to be able to make calls to `DeviceIoControl` to interact with the vulnerable driver.
*   **Knowledge of Kernel Memory Layout:** The attacker needs some knowledge of kernel memory structures (e.g., the `EPROCESS` structure and pool tags) to find and manipulate security tokens of processes.
*  **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Technical Details (from the exploit PoC):**

*   The exploit works by mapping physical memory into the attacker's process space using the vulnerable driver.
*   The exploit then scans the mapped memory looking for "Proc" pool tags.
*   Once found, it locates `EPROCESS` structures of both the attacker's process (typically `cmd.exe`) and a SYSTEM process (e.g., `lsass.exe`).
*   The exploit then overwrites the attacker's security token with that of the SYSTEM process, gaining elevated privileges.
*   The exploit accounts for varying sizes of headers before the `EPROCESS` structure by looking for a marker value (`0x00B80003`).
*   The PoC highlights instability when mapping large chunks of memory using `DeviceIoControl` on Windows 10 and employs a smaller page-sized mapping strategy as a workaround.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was initially identified by researchers at Eclypsium, and this is not the first time this class of vulnerabilty in signed third-party drivers has been seen.
*   The `atillk64.sys` driver was installed by Gigabyte Fusion 2.0 software and potentially other hardware diagnostic tools.
*   The provided write-up includes a full proof-of-concept exploit code.
