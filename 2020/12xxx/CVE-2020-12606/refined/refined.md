Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `ProcedimientoGenerico` method of the `SVCManejador.svc` web service in SGLAC. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an unauthenticated SQL injection, meaning an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the SQL Server.
*   **Command Execution using `xp_cmdshell`:** The attacker can leverage the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure to achieve operating system command execution, potentially gaining full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** This is a remote vulnerability that can be exploited over the network by sending crafted requests to the `SVCManejador.svc` web service.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily accessible to attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SGLAC web frontend.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate with the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects SGLAC versions prior to 20.05.001.
*   A fix is available in version 20.05.001 and later.
*   The vendor is DBSOFT.
*   There is no public Proof of Concept (PoC) available, according to the provided content.

In summary, CVE-2020-12606 is a critical vulnerability that allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and potentially gain full control of the affected system through SQL injection and `xp_cmdshell` usage.
