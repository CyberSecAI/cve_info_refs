    },
    "Analysis": {
      "RootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation when parsing DNS answers from upstream servers, leading to an infinite loop.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Infinite loop"
      ],
      "Impact": "The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) due to the infinite loop, causing the Unbound resolver to become unresponsive or crash, especially when compiled with debugging enabled. It could also be used as part of a larger attack against another DNS server.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "Network: A remote attacker can send malformed DNS responses to an Unbound resolver."
      ],
       "AttackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control or compromise an authoritative name server to send specially crafted, malformed DNS answers to the vulnerable Unbound resolver.",
      "AdditionalNotes": "The issue was discovered via fuzzing the Unbound code, which identified issues in the parser. An assertion may be triggered when compiled with --enable-debug, leading to a crash."
