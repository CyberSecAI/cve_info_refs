Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an OS Command Injection flaw present in the "Ping", "nslookup", and "traceroute" diagnostic tools of the Smart Box router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The router's web interface allows users to execute network diagnostic commands. The input fields for these commands are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Client-Side Validation Bypass:** The router has client-side input validation to prevent invalid addresses. However, this protection can be bypassed by intercepting and modifying the HTTP request using tools like Burp Suite.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The injected commands are executed with the privileges of the "SuperUser" account, regardless of the user account used to access the diagnostic tools (User, admin, or SuperUser).
*   **Vulnerable Services:** The router runs older versions of services (OpenSSH 5.2, FTP vsftpd 3.0.2, and Samba 3.0.22) with known vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system with SuperUser privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in OpenSSH (CVE-2016-6515) and Samba can lead to a denial of service by overloading the router and/or causing it to reboot.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can gain sensitive information about the router and network.
*   **Possible Router Compromise:** Full access to the router can be achieved, allowing for further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the router's web interface accessible over HTTP (or HTTPS), by intercepting and modifying requests to the "Ping," "nslookup", and "traceroute" tools.
*  **Network Man-in-the-Middle:** Network traffic can be sniffed to obtain user credentials, which are base64 encoded but can easily be decoded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router, or have access to the network through VPN or other means.
*   **HTTP Request Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, such as by using Burp Suite or similar tools.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the command injection flaw in the routerâ€™s web interface.

**Additional Information:**

*   The article mentions that the default "SuperUser" password is the router's serial number, which can be found on the router itself or within the admin interface.
*   The router uses base64 encoding for login and password during authentication.
*  The router's HTTPS implementation uses old versions of SSL, making it insecure.
*  The vendor has stopped providing updates to this router.
