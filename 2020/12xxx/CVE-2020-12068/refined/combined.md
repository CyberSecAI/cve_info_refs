Advisory 2020-04

1  Affected Products

The CODESYS Development System's compiler generates code for the integrated CODESYS visualization,
which is then executed on the CODESYS Control runtime systems.

All CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior V3.5.16.0 imply this vulnerability to the generated code.
This is true for both the 32-bit and 64-bit variants.

As a part of the fix was done in the CmpWebServerHandlerV3, all the following CODESYS runtime products are
additional affected in all versions prior V3.5.16.0, regardless of the CPU type or operating system:

• CODESYS Control for BeagleBone
• CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6
• CODESYS Control for IOT2000
• CODESYS Control for Linux
• CODESYS Control for PLCnext
• CODESYS Control for PFC100
• CODESYS Control for PFC200
• CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi
• CODESYS Control RTE V3
• CODESYS Control RTE V3 (for Beckhoff CX)
• CODESYS Control Win V3 (also part of the CODESYS Development System setup)
• CODESYS HMI V3
• CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit

Certain configurations of the CODESYS visualization are susceptible to a privilege escalation attack allowing
access to visualization screens that are intended only for specific operators.

CVE: CVE-2020-12068 [6]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-66210

2.4  Severity Rating

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has rated this vulnerability as medium.

The CVSS v3.0 base score of 6.5 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N). [7]

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS visualization provides several display variants that can be used for displaying visualization
screens. Using the User management feature of the visualization, it is possible to restrict access to parts of the
visualization for certain operators.

The CODESYS WebVisu and the CODESYS Remote TargetVisu are susceptible to a privilege escalation
allowing access to visualization screens that are intended solely for specific operators. This attack is only
possible under one of the following constellations:

© CODESYS Group

4/5

Advisory 2020-04

• The navigation inside the downloaded visualization is done by switching the entire visualization screens and
only the elements for the navigation are protected by the User management.

• The downloaded visualization contains visualization screens that cannot be reached by navigation.

As the vulnerability affects the visualization feature itself, therefore the CODESYS Control runtime products are
only affected, if the visualization feature is used.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has released version V3.5.16.0 to solve the noted vulnerability issue for all
affected CODESYS products.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

To fix the vulnerability an update of the CODESYS Development system is needed. If the CODESYS WebVisu
is used, an update of the involved CODESYS Control runtime system running the Webserver is necessary too.
In the CODESYS Development system, the fix is bound to the visualization profile. Starting with visualization
profile V3.5.16.0, only the configured start visualizations (in the visualization clients below the Visualization
Manager) are allowed to be accessed. Therefore the effective visualization profiles in the CODESYS project
must be set to a version >= V3.5.16.0 to make the fix effective.

The previous behavior can be restored by setting the compiler define VISU_NO_STARTVISU_CHECK.
However, this is recommended only for compatibility. Instead of setting this compiler define, you should add
additional visualization client objects to have several start visualizations.

5  Mitigation

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerabilities.

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has identified the following workarounds for this vulnerability, in case the
software update is not applied:
• Use frames for navigation instead of switching the entire visualization screen.
• Use the protection of the User management in the CODESYS visualization not only for the navigation
elements but also for all elements that should be restricted to certain operators only.
• Only include visualization screens in the application that are intended for being accessed by operators of the
CODESYS WebVisu and the CODESYS Remote TargetVisu.

As part of a security strategy, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends the following general defense
measures to reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
