Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper privilege management within the CODESYS visualization feature. Specifically, how the CODESYS WebVisu and Remote TargetVisu handle access to visualization screens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The system fails to properly restrict access to visualization screens based on user roles, allowing unauthorized users to view restricted content.
*   **Vulnerable Navigation Logic:**  The vulnerability is triggered in scenarios where:
    *   Navigation within the downloaded visualization is handled by switching entire screens, and only the navigation elements are protected by user management.
    *   The downloaded visualization contains screens that are not reachable via normal navigation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain access to visualization screens that should be restricted to specific operators, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized control.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Sensitive operational data may become visible to unauthorized individuals.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.
*   **WebVisu and Remote TargetVisu:** The CODESYS WebVisu and Remote TargetVisu are the primary attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the affected CODESYS system.
*   **Low Skill Level:**  The advisory states that an attacker with low technical skills can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affects all CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior to V3.5.16.0, and a number of CODESYS runtime products, including:
    *   CODESYS Control for BeagleBone
    *   CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6
    *   CODESYS Control for IOT2000
    *   CODESYS Control for Linux
    *   CODESYS Control for PLCnext
    *   CODESYS Control for PFC100
    *   CODESYS Control for PFC200
    *   CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi
    *   CODESYS Control RTE V3
    *   CODESYS Control RTE V3 (for Beckhoff CX)
    *   CODESYS Control Win V3
    *   CODESYS HMI V3
    *   CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit
*   The vulnerability affects the visualization feature itself, so runtime products are only impacted if the visualization feature is used.
*   The advisory provides workarounds, which include using frames for navigation, protecting all elements with user management, and only including screens intended for web/remote access.
*   A software update to version V3.5.16.0 resolves the issue.

This information aligns with the CVE description by detailing a privilege escalation issue in CODESYS visualization.
