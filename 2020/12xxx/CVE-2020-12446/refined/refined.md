Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `ene.sys` driver in older versions of the Trident Z Lighting Control software exposes functionality that allows unprivileged local users to:
    - Map and unmap physical memory.
    - Read and write to Model Specific Register (MSR) registers.
    - Input from and output to I/O ports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core vulnerability lies in the driver's lack of access control, permitting unprivileged users to interact with hardware resources that should be restricted to the operating system kernel.
- This exposes the system to arbitrary memory access, MSR modification, and I/O manipulation by non-administrative users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` level.
- Arbitrary code execution.
- Full system compromise is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- An attacker with non-privileged user access can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local non-privileged user account on the target system.
- Ability to interact with the vulnerable driver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of Trident Z Lighting Control v1.00.08 and older.
- G.SKILL released a patch in version 1.00.17 to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by ACTIVELabs.
- The vendor was very responsive in issuing multiple patches, and the researcher was able to confirm the final patch resolved the vulnerability.
