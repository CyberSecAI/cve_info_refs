# Gigamon - GigaVUE 0day

Hi,

An issue was discovered in Gigamon GigaVUE 5.5.01.11.
The upload functionality allows an authenticated user to change the
filename value (in the POST method) from the original filename
to achieve directory traversal via a ../ sequence and, for example,
obtain a complete directory listing of the machine.

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
This vulnerability aid the attacker in discovering the whole file
system in the underlying host system - including identifying the
writeable and read-only file systems.

The authenticated user needs to use the upload functionality. The POST
HTTP verb is being used which needs to be intercepted, and modified
(the "filename" parameter must be manipulated in the POST body
section)

These vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor. They said this
version will be decommissioned in 2023 and they decided not to provide
technical support anymore. In other words, they will not fix any IT
Security Issues which have lower than critical risk. This
version is in production in enterprise environments, and will be
available until end of 2023, so the impact is real.

Use CVE-2020-12251.

An issue was discovered in Gigamon GigaVUE 5.5.01.11. The upload
functionality allows an arbitrary file upload for an authenticated
user. If an executable file is uploaded into the www-root directory,
then it could yield remote code execution via the filename parameter.
