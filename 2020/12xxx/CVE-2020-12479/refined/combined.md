## Description

![@bstapes](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20693610?v=4&size=48)[bstapes](https://github.com/bstapes)opened [on Apr 2, 2020](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/issues/2762#issue-592751961)

Teampass allows users to choose from several different languages. The user changes their language preference by sending a POST request to Teampass (`/teampass/sources/users.queries.php`) that contains the string of the language they choose (“english”, “spanish”, etc). This string provided by the user is not validated or sanitized in any way.

After the string provided by the user is stored in the DB, it is eventually used in `core.php` during login on line 78:

`require_once $SETTINGS['cpassman_dir'].'/includes/language/'.$_SESSION['user_language'].'.php';`

This allows any user to file\_include any existing PHP file on disk. If a user could upload their own PHP file, then it could be combined with this bug to achieve code execution on the Teampass server.

**Steps to reproduce**

Send a POST request to change user language, but modify the value of the `newValue` parameter to a value of your choosing (eg: `../backups/script.backup`).

```
POST /teampass/sources/users.queries.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: http://localhost/teampass/index.php?page=items
Cookie: <cookie>;
KEY_PHPSESSID=<value>;
PHPSESSID=<value>;
jstree_select=2

newValue=Spanish&id=userlanguage_10000004&<cookie>

```

Log out and log back in to force the TeamPass server to read the PHP file of your choosing.

**Steps to fix**

* Validate the value from the “newValue” parameter. The only permissible values should be a hard-coded list of strings that exist in /includes/language/ [directory](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/tree/master/includes/language) EG: `$validLanguages = array('arabic', 'bulgarian', 'etc');`.
* In the case of a non-valid value, Teampass should deny the language change and immediately stop processing the data in the newValue parameter. This validation could potentially occur [here](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/blob/master/sources/users.queries.php#L1659), where the `userlanguage` parameter is processed.
