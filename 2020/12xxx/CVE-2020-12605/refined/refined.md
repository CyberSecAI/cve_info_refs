Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-12605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from inconsistent enforcement of HTTP/1.1 request/response header size limits within Envoy. Specifically:
    *   **Missing Incremental Size Validation:** Envoy lacks incremental size validation when parsing header field names. This allows for excessive buffering of header field names beyond the configured `max_header_size` limit.
    *   **Missing Request URL Size Check:** The size of the request URL is not included in the computed request header size. This allows Envoy to attempt route matching and proxying of HTTP/1.1 requests with very large URLs (up to a hard-coded 32MB).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of header field names and request URLs size before processing the request, leading to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Lack of Throttling:** The system does not properly limit or throttle the amount of memory allocated, allowing an attacker to potentially exhaust resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** By sending requests with oversized headers or URLs, an attacker can cause Envoy to consume excessive amounts of memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Resource Consumption (Memory):**  Excessive memory usage due to the lack of size checks can impact the performance and stability of the system.
*   **Performance Issues:** Large URLs can cause performance issues in regex route matching.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted HTTP/1.1 requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/1.1 requests to an Envoy instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Envoy versions 1.14.2, 1.13.2, 1.12.4 or older.
*   The hard-coded buffer limit was 32MB before timeout.
*   Patched versions are 1.14.3, 1.13.3, and 1.12.5.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling".
