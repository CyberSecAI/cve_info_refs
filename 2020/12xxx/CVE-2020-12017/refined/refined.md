### Summary:
The advisory discusses a Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in GE Grid Solutions Reason RT Clocks. Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information access, arbitrary code execution, and device unresponsiveness.

### Technical Details:

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)
*   **Affected Products:** GE Grid Solutions Reason RT Clocks (RT430, RT431, and RT434) with firmware versions prior to 08A05.
*   **Root Cause:** The web application has a vulnerability that allows multiple unauthenticated attacks, leading to serious impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by executing arbitrary commands and sending a request to a specific URL.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution
    *   Device unresponsiveness
    *   Change the password of the 'configuration' user account
    *   Modify the configuration of the device via the web interface
    *   Bypass the authentication required to configure the device and reboot the system.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Low skill level required; exploitable remotely within the local network.
*   **CVSS Score:** 9.6 (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H)

### Mitigation:

*   Update to firmware Version 08A05 or greater.
*   Use strong network and physical security.
*   Block TCP/IP Ports 80 and 443 to block HTTP/HTTPS access to the RT clock web interface.
*   Minimize network exposure for all control system devices.
*   Analyze security events for unexpected traffic.
