Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-12829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sm501_2d_operation()` function within the QEMU emulator's SM501 graphics driver. This overflow occurs within the `COPY_AREA` macro when handling MMIO write operations through the `sm501_2d_engine_write()` callback. The specific condition is when the `rtl` parameter is set to 1, and either `src_y` or `src_x` is less than `operation_height`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The core issue is an integer overflow within the `COPY_AREA` macro.
- Out-of-bounds (OOB) Read/Write: The integer overflow can lead to out-of-bounds read and write operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit can crash the QEMU process on the host, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: While not explicitly confirmed in all sources, some descriptions mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution along with a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker inside the guest: The attacker needs to be inside the guest VM to trigger the vulnerability via MMIO writes.
- Specifically crafted MMIO write operations: The attacker needs to send specifically crafted MMIO write operations to trigger the overflow in `COPY_AREA`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Guest access: An attacker must have the ability to execute code inside the guest virtual machine.
- MMIO access: The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate MMIO addresses related to the SM501 display device in the guest.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the SM501 display driver implementation of QEMU.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry clarifies that the vulnerability lies in the `sm501_2d_operation()` function within `hw/display/sm501.c`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed upstream in the following commit:  `https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=b15a22bbcbe6a78dc3d88fe3134985e4cdd87de4`
*   Red Hat stated that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8 and RHEL Advanced Virtualization are not affected because the vulnerable code or the SM501 device was not included/built in those products.
*   Debian's security advisory (DSA-4760-1) mentions that the integer overflow in the sm501 display device may result in denial of service.
*   Ubuntu security notice (USN-4467-1) states that an attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
