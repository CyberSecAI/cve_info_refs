  "CVE-2020-12117": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "An error in Moxa NPort 5100A Series Serial Device Server allows unauthorized access to serial port configurations via the Moxa Service.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, the Moxa Service, which is enabled by default, allows an attacker to obtain the serial port configurations of the device without proper authentication.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the serial port configurations of the device, potentially revealing sensitive information.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted UDP packet to port 4800 to exploit the vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Moxa device, but no authentication is required."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure default configuration of the Moxa Service on Moxa devices. The Moxa Service, a legacy utility for device discovery and fetching configuration details, is enabled by default and allows unauthenticated access to sensitive information.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure via an unauthenticated service. Specifically, the Moxa Service allows an attacker to query a device's configuration without authentication using a crafted UDP packet.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive device configuration data, including serial port settings.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted UDP packet to port 4800.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Moxa device, but no authentication is required."

      "Attack vectors": "Network. A remote non-authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the internet.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted packet to a vulnerable device via the network. No authentication is required."
