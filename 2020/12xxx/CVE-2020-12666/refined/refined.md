Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12666:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `macaron` web framework handles static file serving. Specifically, when a request is made for a path that isn't a registered route, `macaron` checks if the requested path exists in the static directory. If the path ends with `..` (e.g., `//example.com/..`), the `http.FileSystem` treats it as a directory. This then triggers a redirect to the same path with a trailing slash, resulting in an open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Open Redirect:** The core vulnerability is an open redirect. By crafting a specific URL, an attacker can force the application to redirect a user to an arbitrary external website.
- **Insufficient URL Sanitization:** The `macaron` framework doesn't properly sanitize or validate URLs before performing a redirect within its static file handler.
- **Bypass of Browser Normalization:** Some browsers, like Chrome, attempt to normalize URLs by removing `../` sequences. The vulnerability can be exploited by encoding the `/` character within the path as `%2f`, bypassing this normalization and delivering a malicious path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use the open redirect to redirect users to malicious websites that mimic legitimate sites, attempting to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The provided example in the GitHub issue demonstrates that if a vulnerable application uses a 302 redirect in combination with an http client which follows redirects, it can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks, allowing the attacker to access internal network resources.
- **Chain Attacks:** The open redirect can be chained with other vulnerabilities to increase the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a URL with a path containing `//` followed by a malicious domain and `..`, targeting the application's static file handler. For example: `http://vulnerable-app.com//malicious.com/..`
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL, for example via a phishing email or crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the application is using the vulnerable `macaron` framework, specifically using the static file server, and the structure of a malicious url.

**Additional details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in `macaron` version 1.3.7 by cleaning the path URL before redirecting.
- Red Hat has addressed the issue in their products including OpenShift Service Mesh.
- The vulnerability was present in `macaron` versions prior to 1.3.7.
