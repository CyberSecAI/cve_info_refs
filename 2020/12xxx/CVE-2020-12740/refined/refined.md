Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12740:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer over-read occurs in the `get_ipv6_next()` function within the `common/get.c` file of the tcpreplay software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The vulnerability stems from reading beyond the allocated buffer on the heap in the `get_ipv6_next` function. Specifically, the code attempts to read an integer value at an offset that exceeds the boundary of the allocated memory region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the `tcprewrite` application, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Potential Information Exposure:** There's a possibility of information exposure as the application attempts to process the malformed pcap file, due to the memory being read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted pcap file. An attacker can create a malicious pcap file designed to trigger the vulnerability when processed by `tcprewrite`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Malicious pcap file creation:** The attacker needs the capability to craft a pcap file that can trigger the vulnerable code path in `get_ipv6_next()`.
- **Execution of tcprewrite:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `tcprewrite` application with the crafted pcap file as input. This might involve local file access or potentially remote transfer of the malformed pcap file to the target system.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located at `common/get.c:454`, where the code reads a `maxlen` value from an offset within the `exthdr` buffer:
```c
   454        maxlen = *((int*)((u_char *)exthdr + len));
```
- The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output shows a heap-buffer-overflow, indicating that the memory read at `0x63100001080e` is 1 byte to the right of a 65549-byte region allocated on the heap.
- The GDB debug output confirms a segmentation fault occurs when trying to read a DWORD from a memory location outside the valid bounds of the buffer at the mentioned line.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects `tcprewrite`.
- The issue was addressed in tcpreplay version 4.3.3
- The issue was reported on May 8, 2020.

The provided information clearly indicates the heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability, how to trigger it, and its impact.
