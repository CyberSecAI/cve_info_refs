The provided content includes a detailed write-up about CVE-2020-12713 and CVE-2020-12714. The write-up explains the vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and the fixes that were implemented. 

Based on the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **CVE-2020-12713:** Unrestricted modification of Postfix configuration file `main.cf` through the web interface, allowing execution of arbitrary code as root.
*   **CVE-2020-12714:**  Manipulation of backup files, specifically the SQL dump, and the Postfix configuration file within it, to execute arbitrary commands as the `djigzo` user during restore.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CVE-2020-12713:** Lack of input sanitization or validation when updating the Postfix main configuration file. Failure to restrict the settings that can be modified.
*   **CVE-2020-12714:** The `mysql` command used for database restoration allowed execution of arbitrary non-SQL `system` commands. The backup/restore system did not validate the integrity or safety of configuration files contained within backups.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **CVE-2020-12713:** Privilege escalation from web interface administrator to full root access, allowing complete control over the system.
*   **CVE-2020-12714:** Privilege escalation from web interface administrator to `djigzo` user, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands as that user.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **CVE-2020-12713:** A malicious administrator can insert code into the Postfix configuration via the web interface that executes upon Postfix configuration reload.
*   **CVE-2020-12714:** A malicious administrator can create a backup file, modify the SQL dump file and the `main.cf` within it to inject arbitrary commands, and then restore the modified backup via web interface or command line.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Both CVEs:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in administrator of the CipherMail web interface.

**Additional details:**
*   The writeup also mentions a related issue with weak Diffie-Hellman parameters used by Postfix but this was not a CVE.
*   The write-up details specific fixes: For CVE-2020-12713, they restricted the allowable settings in the postfix configuration. For CVE-2020-12714, they either required an additional system password when restoring via the web interface or completely disabled restoring via the web interface. Patches are available for older releases.
*   The write-up also highlights the importance of validating the source and integrity of backup files before restoring.
