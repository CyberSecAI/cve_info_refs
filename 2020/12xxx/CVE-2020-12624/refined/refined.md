The provided content does not directly relate to CVE-2020-12624. The content describes vulnerabilities found in two dating applications, "Coffee Meets Bagel" and "The League," but it does not reference any specific CVE IDs in the text.

However, the following vulnerabilities were found in "The League" app:

**1. Client-side generated authentication tokens**
   - **Root Cause:** The app generates authentication tokens (bearer tokens) client-side using a UUID, instead of generating them on the server.
   - **Weakness:** The server does not validate the generated UUID.
   - **Impact:** Potential for collisions and other problems.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Client-side generation of the authentication token.
   - **Required capabilities:**  Attacker can control the bearer token generation.

**2. Phone number leak through an unauthenticated API**
   - **Root Cause:**  An unauthenticated API endpoint reveals whether a phone number is registered or not, based on the HTTP response code.
   - **Weakness:** Information exposure through an unauthenticated API.
   - **Impact:**  Enumerating users, potential embarrassment if users are exposed.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending unauthenticated requests to the API endpoint.
   - **Required capabilities:** Ability to send requests to the unauthenticated API.

**3. LinkedIn Job Details Exposure**
    - **Root Cause:** The app over-collects job data from linked in.
    - **Weakness:** Leaking unnecessary details from LinkedIn profile.
    - **Impact:**  Potential exposure of sensitive career information to other users.
    - **Attack Vector:** Viewing user's profile on the app.
    - **Required capabilities:**  Normal user access to the app.

**4. Picture and video leak through misconfigured S3 buckets**
   - **Root Cause:** S3 buckets containing user photos and videos are publicly accessible.
   - **Weakness:** Misconfigured S3 buckets, missing authentication, and public listing enabled.
   - **Impact:** Full exposure of user photos and videos, including metadata, competitor can enumerate users.
   - **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the misconfigured S3 buckets.
   - **Required capabilities:** Ability to access S3 buckets (no authentication).

**5. IP Doxing through Link Previews**
    - **Root Cause:** The app uses recipient-side link previews, so the request for the preview is made from the user's device.
    - **Weakness:** Recipient side link preview exposes user IP to malicious URL.
    - **Impact:** User IP address can be revealed to malicious actors when viewing chat message.
    - **Attack Vector:** Sending malicious URL to user, which the app automatically fetches.
    - **Required capabilities:** Can send chat messages with a URL to the victim.

**6. Zero-click session hijacking through chat**
   - **Root Cause:** The app attaches the authorization header (bearer token) to requests to external domains.
   - **Weakness:** Improper reuse of a global OkHttp client and unnecessary inclusion of authentication headers.
   - **Impact:**  Full session hijacking, attacker gains access to user account.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending a link to a malicious server through chat. The app fetches the link leaking the authentication header.
   - **Required capabilities:** Ability to send chat messages with a URL to the victim.

Therefore, while the content is about vulnerabilities, it does not relate to CVE-2020-12624, so the answer is:

**UNRELATED**
