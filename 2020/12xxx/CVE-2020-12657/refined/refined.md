Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12657:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The official CVE description for CVE-2020-12657 is: "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.5. There is a use-after-free in block/bfq-iosched.c related to bfq\_idle\_slice\_timer\_body."

The provided content includes multiple patches, and one of them is directly related to `block/bfq-iosched.c` and mentions `bfq_idle_slice_timer_body`, so this content is considered RELEVANT. Specifically, the patch titled "block, bfq: fix use-after-free in bfq\_idle\_slice\_timer\_body" resolves this vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the Block Fair Queueing (BFQ) I/O scheduler, specifically within the `bfq_idle_slice_timer` function and its associated `bfq_idle_slice_timer_body` function. The `bfqq` variable, representing a BFQ queue, is read outside of the `bfqd->lock` critical section, which leads to a potential use-after-free if the queue is freed by a different thread.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Use-After-Free:**  A pointer to a `bfq_queue` structure might be used after it has been freed from memory, leading to a crash. The `bfqq` variable, obtained from `bfqd->in_service_queue`, can be concurrently modified or freed by other threads if not protected by a lock.
    *  **Race Condition:** The `bfqq` variable may be accessed concurrently by different parts of the code. The code accessing it in `bfq_idle_slice_timer_body` may access it after it has been expired/freed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A local attacker may cause a denial of service through a kernel crash. The content does not indicate potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local Access: Attackers require local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Specific I/O Scheduling: The vulnerability is related to the Block Fair Queueing (BFQ) I/O scheduler, which could potentially be targeted to trigger it.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local User: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
    *   I/O Operations: The attacker needs to be able to initiate I/O operations that trigger the use of the BFQ scheduler, and have control over the operations that might free up a queue being processed by `bfq_idle_slice_timer_body`.

**3. Technical Details**
The core issue is that the `bfqq` variable, representing a BFQ queue, may be accessed by the `bfq_idle_slice_timer_body` function after it has been freed. This occurs because the `bfqq` variable is obtained from `bfqd->in_service_queue` without appropriate locking and can be modified/freed by other threads or operations.
The fix involves the following:
    *  First the code will check if the `bfqq` variable obtained from  `bfqd->in_service_queue` is actually the active queue by comparing it to `bfqd->in_service_queue`. If it's not the active queue it will return early.
    *   The `bfq_idle_slice_timer_body` function is modified to take `bfqd` as a parameter, and thus allows checks to be performed with the spinlock in `bfq_idle_slice_timer_body`.
    *   The check to see if the queue is in service, and the clearing of the `bfqq->wait_request` flag happen within the critical section.

**4. Additional Notes:**
The SUSE content indicates that it has been resolved with a low severity score for their products.

The content from the kernel changelog also describes other kernel fixes:
  - The content includes fixes for various other vulnerabilities across several kernel modules including, but not limited to, ACPI, ALSA, BPF, CIFS, DRM, IOMMU, KEYS, KVM, MM, NFS, PCI, PowerPC, RCU, SCSI, SPI, and USB.
   - Multiple patches to the BFQ I/O scheduler, are also included along with fixes for data corruption and deadlocks, but are not directly related to CVE-2020-12657.
   - Some of these include use-after-free, memory leaks, null-pointer dereferences, and various race conditions.

Based on the analysis of the content, the identified root cause, impact, and mitigation steps, and the fix, it's a relevant CVE.
