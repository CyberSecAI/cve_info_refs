Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-12675:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content directly references CVE-2020-12675 and identifies it as a vulnerability in the "MapPress Maps for WordPress" plugin.
*   The description aligns with typical plugin vulnerabilities: arbitrary file download/deletion/upload leading to potential remote code execution (RCE).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is not explicitly detailed but it's mentioned that a flaw allows for arbitrary file download, deletion, or upload. The Alert Logic blog mentions that this was discovered during a threat hunt.
*   The vulnerability was present in MapPress plugin versions prior to 2.54.6

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker could potentially download any file on the server that the web server user has access to.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker could delete any file on the server that the web server user has access to.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker could upload a malicious PHP file to the server, potentially leading to RCE
*   **Insufficient Privilege Checks**: The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker having "subscriber privileges", indicating insufficient checks on user roles to access the vulnerable functionality

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to full compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** The arbitrary file download vulnerability could expose sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The arbitrary file deletion vulnerability could disrupt service availability.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can upload a malicious file and deface the website.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **WordPress Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability resides within the MapPress plugin for WordPress.
*   **Web Interface:** Exploitation likely involves sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin through the WordPress web interface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Subscriber Privileges:** The attacker needs at least "subscriber" level access to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates the issue isn't accessible to anonymous users.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send exploit requests.

**7. Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Alert Logic's Threat Research team during a threat hunt.
*   Alert Logic worked with the MapPress development team to resolve the issue.
*   Alert Logic deployed detection content to their Security Operations Center to identify and alert customers to potential exploitation attempts.

**Summary:**

The content reveals a critical vulnerability in the MapPress WordPress plugin (CVE-2020-12675), allowing low-privileged users (subscribers) to download, delete, or upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.54.6, and users are strongly urged to update immediately.
