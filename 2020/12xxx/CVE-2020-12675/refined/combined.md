## Description

MapPress is the easiest way to add unlimited, beautiful interactive Google and Leaflet maps to WordPress.

Create **unlimited maps and markers** using Gutenberg blocks or the classic editor. The popup map editor makes creating and editing maps easy!

Upgrade to [MapPress Pro](https://mappresspro.com/mappress) for even more features, including custom icons (with a built-in icon editor!), search and filter, clustering, and much more. See it in action on the [MapPress Home Page](https://mappresspro.com/mappress) or test it yourself with a [Free Demo Site](https://mappresspro.com/demo)!

### Upgrade

2. Delete your old MapPress version (don’t worry, the maps are saved in the database)
3. Follow the installation instructions to install the new version

I am currently using Mappress for a client project, and it was the best solution I could find to meet all of my client’s needs. Most importantly, the support from the Mappress team has been stellar and has saved me many hours of frustration.

# Alert Logic Identifies New Vulnerability: CVE-2020-12675 in MapPress Plugin for WordPress

Posted **May 28, 2020**
By: [Fortra's Alert Logic](https://www.alertlogic.com/blog/author/webmasterfortra-com/)

During a recent threat hunt aimed at WordPress plugins, the Alert Logic Threat Research team identified a vulnerability in [MapPress Maps for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress). The MapPress plugin has over 80,000 installations. This vulnerability enables an attacker with subscriber privileges to download or delete arbitrary PHP files or upload arbitrary malicious PHP files to vulnerable sites, which could result in remote command execution. After working with the MapPress development team, this vulnerability has been resolved as of version 2.54.6.

Per the [Alert Logic](http://alertlogic.com) responsible disclosure policy, we contacted the developer to report the issue and worked closely with them to resolve the underlying vulnerability. We commend the MapPress development team for responding quickly and working with us openly to resolve the issue. We have reported the vulnerability to MITRE and it has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2020-12675. You can visit the [CVE page](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12675) for additional details (please note, this page is currently in reserved status and more content will be added shortly).

In addition to identifying the CVE, Alert Logic’s Threat Intelligence team has deployed detection content to enable our Security Operations Center to catch and alert our customers to any potential exploits.

Alert Logic strongly recommends that all parties using the MapPress plugin for WordPress immediately update to version 2.54.6 or newer to remediate this vulnerability. We will be providing additional details about this vulnerability in the coming weeks.
