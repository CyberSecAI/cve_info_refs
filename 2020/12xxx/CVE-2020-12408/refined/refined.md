  "CVE-2020-12408": {
    "description": "When browsing a document hosted on an IP address, an attacker could insert certain characters to flip domain and path information in the address bar.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way Firefox handles right-to-left (RTL) characters in URLs when the domain is an IP address. The presence of an RTL character in the URL path can cause the browser to render the domain and path in the wrong order in the address bar.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "URL Spoofing",
       "Incorrect handling of RTL characters in URLs",
       "Insufficient input validation/sanitization for URLs containing IP addresses and RTL characters"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when displayed in the address bar, shows a different domain than the actual server the browser is connected to. This can be used for phishing or other social engineering attacks, where a user may be tricked into believing they are visiting a legitimate site when they are actually on a malicious one.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted URLs containing IP addresses and RTL characters",
      "Social engineering to trick users into clicking on such URLs"
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute malicious URLs. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the user's machine.  They also need to be able to host content at an IP address."
