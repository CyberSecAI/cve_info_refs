The provided content is related to CVE-2020-12129.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The AirDisk Pro v5.5.3 iOS application suffers from multiple persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent XSS:** Malicious script code can be injected into the application through three different parameters:
    - `createFolder` parameter in the "Create Folder" function.
    - `deleteFile` parameter in the "Delete" function.
    - `devicename` parameter displayed next to the application logo.
- The injected scripts are persistently stored and executed on subsequent requests/interactions with the vulnerable parts of the application.
- The application does not properly sanitize input for these parameters, allowing injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Persistent phishing attacks
- Persistent external redirects to malicious sources
- Persistent manipulation of affected application modules

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with wifi access.
- The injection of malicious script codes occurs via POST requests to the application.
- The `devicename` parameter can also be exploited, and executes each time the wifi sharing ui service of Airdisk Pro is opened.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim's device.
- The attacker needs to be able to make POST requests to the application or modify the device name to inject the malicious code.
- Low user interaction is required to trigger the execution of the injected scripts.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is also exploitable through the unauthenticated FTP service, which is enabled by default. This allows injecting malicious scripts into folders and files without authentication.
- The `createFolder` vulnerability allows injection of scripts when naming/renaming folders.
- The `deleteFile` vulnerability allows injection of scripts into the delete confirmation popup.
- The `devicename` vulnerability allows injecting scripts into the device name displayed in the application UI.
