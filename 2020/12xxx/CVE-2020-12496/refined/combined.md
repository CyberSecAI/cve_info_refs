#### Weakness

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor [(CWE-200)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)

#### Summary

Endress+Hauser Ecograph T (Neutral/Private Label) (RSG35, ORSG35) and Memograph M (Neutral/Private Label) (RSG45, ORSG45) with Firmware version V2.0.0 and above is prone to exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. The firmware release has a dynamic token for each request submitted to the server, which makes repeating requests and analysis complex enough. Nevertheless, it's possible and during the analysis it was discovered that it also has an issue with the access-control matrix on the server-side. It was found that a user with low rights can get information from endpoints that should not be available to this user.

#### Details

[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12496)

---

#### Impact

It was found that a user with low rights can get information from endpoints that should not be available to this user.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

Customers should configure a perimeter firewall to block traffic from untrusted networks and users to the device. These recommendations will be incorporated into the device documentation (operating instructions)
Change default password for operator, service and admin account.

Endress+Hauser will not change this behavior.
Customers are recommended to take the measures for Temporary Fix / Mitigation as described above.
