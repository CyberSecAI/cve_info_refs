Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an issue with the access-control matrix on the server-side of the affected devices' webserver firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from an improperly implemented access-control matrix. This allows users with low privileges to access endpoints and sensitive information that should be restricted to higher-privilege users.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Due to the access control issue, sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A low-privileged user can gain access to sensitive information that they should not have access to. This could include device configuration, operational data, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the device's webserver interface.
*   **Authentication Required:**  An attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the device to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged User Access:** The attacker needs to have an existing low-privileged user account on the affected device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device's web server.

**Summary of Findings**
The vulnerability allows a low-privileged authenticated user to access sensitive information by bypassing the access controls of the webserver application.
