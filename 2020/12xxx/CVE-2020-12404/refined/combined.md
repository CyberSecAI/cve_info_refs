Firefox Version: v24.1

OS: iOS 13.3.1

Issue: Universal XSS on Firefox iOS Download link Action

Description:

Firefox iOS user clicks download link in hyperlink option and XSS is triggered on current url, When the hyperlink is in format [https://anydomain/','123');alert(document.domain);//](https://anydomain/%27%2C%27123%27%29%3Balert%28document.domain%29%3B//)

Sample attack scenerio

* Attacker links [https://attacker.com/','123');alert(](https://attacker.com/%27%2C%27123%27%29;alert() in google.com index
* Victim click's download link on firefox iOS

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open <https://vinothkumar.tech/firefox-ios> your iOS firefox browser.
2. Hold the link until preview popup appears.
3. Click Download Link
4. XSS is triggered

Root Cause:

[https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/v24.1/Client/Frontend/Browser/BrowserViewController/BrowserViewController+WebViewDelegates.swift#L171](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/v24.1/Client/Frontend/Browser/BrowserViewController/BrowserViewController%2BWebViewDelegates.swift#L171)

Unescaped url link is being appeneded to the javascript when download action clicked

```
currentTab.webView?.evaluateJavaScript("window.__firefox__.download('\(url.absoluteString)', '\(UserScriptManager.securityToken)')")

```

currentTab.webView?.evaluateJavaScript("window.__firefox__.download('\(safeUrl)', '\(UserScriptManager.securityToken)')")

```

Garvan, can you help prioritize this? I don't have an iOS device but the write-up in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1631739#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - XSS from booby-trapped link on Firefox iOS Download Link Action") looks pretty serious.

Also with this issue attacker can get security token value in the XSS. Using security token attacker can trigger webkit.messageHandlers events(loginsManagerMessageHandler, printHandler, sessionRestoreHelper, .. etc)

Payload to get security token:

```
<a href="https://domain/','123');a=eval(decodeURIComponent('(function(a,b){alert(b);})'));a('1">XSS</a>

```

The above payload will alert the security token.

It's not exactly a "Universal" XSS -- the attacker can't pick any arbitrary victim site. The target site has to be one where users can add links (which is still a large number of popular sites, especial social ones) and a context where the victim will want to download the link rather than click on it to open.

CVE for v25 was missed for this bug, assigning it to v26 in order to get picked up by the release notes process.

The bug <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1632387> is the same type of attack, leaking the token, and did have a sec advisory for v25.
