{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The MJML component `mj-include` does not properly validate the `path` attribute, allowing directory traversal.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal (CWE-22)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can leak local server paths, enumerate local server files, partially read binary server files, or cause denial of service conditions on the application embedding MJML.",
      "attack_vectors": "By using the `path` attribute of the `mj-include` component in a MJML template, an attacker can specify paths outside the web server's root directory.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the MJML template that is being processed by a vulnerable version of MJML. This could be an unauthenticated or authenticated user depending on how the application uses MJML."
    }

  "affected_versions": "MJML <= 4.6.2",
  "patch": "Update MJML to version 4.6.3 and keep `ignoreIncludes` set to false, or ensure that `ignoreIncludes` is set to `true`."
