This post describes how I approached the process, identifying the missing parts and building the entire POP chain.

Back in March 2023, I noticed an interesting security advisory that was published by Wordfence about a critical "Authentication Bypass and Privilege Escalation" (aka CVE-2023-28121) affecting the "WooCommerce Payments" plugin which has more than 600.000 active...

CVE:            CVE-2020-12827

2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.

3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
MJML <= 4.6.2

As a solution MJML disabled mj-include by default in MJML v4.6.3 by adding the
"ignoreIncludes" directive, however, the component could still be explicitly
enabled, making the application vulnerable again.

4. INTRODUCTION
===============
MJML is a markup language created by Mailjet and designed to reduce the pain of
coding a responsive email. Its semantic syntax makes it easy and straightforward
while its rich standard components library fastens your development time and
lightens your email codebase. MJML’s open-source engine takes care of
translating the MJML you wrote into responsive HTML.

(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
MJML offers a component called "mj-include" that allows other external MJML
files to be included into the email template by using its "path" attribute.
(see <https://mjml.io/documentation/#mj-include>).

However MJML does not properly validate the value supplied to the "path"
argument, allowing an attacker to traverse directories or even directly point to
other system files outside of the web server's root directory.

However since MJML expects the referenced file to be in the format of a MJML
file, the attack scope is limited to:

- Leaking the local server path by pointing to a non-existing MJML file, which
throws an error containing the full path, i.e.:
<mjml><mj-include path='test'/></mjml>

- Enumerating local server files by using a true/false approach. Existing server
files return an error, while non-existing do not:
<mjml><mj-include path='/etc/passwd'/></mjml>

- Partially reading local binary server files. Pointing path to binary files
throws an error, but the error message does contain a portion of the referenced
file. On this way it is possible to leak parts of i.e. compressed local log
files:
<mjml><mj-include path='/var/log/apt/history.log.1.gz'/></mjml>

- Causing denial of service conditions on the application embedding MJML, by
reading i.e. /dev/urandom:
<mjml><mj-include path='/dev/urandom'/></mjml>

6. RISK
=======
The vulnerability can be used by an unauthenticated attacker or authenticated
attacker depending on how MJML is embedded to leak sensitive information about
the server such as local server paths and contents of compressed/binary files
or cause denial of service attacks against the application.

7. SOLUTION
===========
Update MJML to version 4.6.3 and keep "ignoreIncludes" set to false.

8. REPORT TIMELINE
==================
2020-04-28: Discovery of the vulnerability
2020-04-30: Reported the vulnerability to maintainers of MJML
2020-05-05: MJML pushes a fix disabling includes by default.
2020-05-11: CVE requested from MITRE
2020-05-13: MITRE assigns CVE-2020-12827
2020-06-14: Public disclosure.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
