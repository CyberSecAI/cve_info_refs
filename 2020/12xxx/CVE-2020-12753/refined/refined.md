Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way LG's bootloader handles image resources stored in the "raw\_resources" partition of the eMMC. Specifically, the RLE decompression routine in both SBL1 and aboot fails to perform bounds checks on the x and y offsets within the image metadata. This allows an attacker to control the output pointer during decompression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Write:** The lack of bounds checking on `offs_x` and `offs_y` in the `load_res_888rle_image` function allows for an attacker to specify an arbitrary memory address as the destination for decompressed image data, causing an arbitrary write.
*   **RLE decompression vulnerability:** The RLE decompression routine in the bootloader is vulnerable to memory corruption if the metadata isn't properly validated, leading to an arbitrary memory write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (SBL1):** By exploiting the arbitrary write in SBL1, an attacker can overwrite parts of SBL1 to disable signature verification, allowing them to load and execute their own code in Secure EL3. This enables full control of the phone. Due to the MMU being enabled in SBL1 a ROP chain is required.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (aboot):** Similarly, the arbitrary write in aboot can be used to gain code execution in non-secure EL1. This allows the attacker to modify the boot process and load unsigned kernels.
*   **Bootloader Unlocking:** Exploiting this vulnerability in aboot could be used to achieve bootloader unlocking on affected devices, which would allow for flashing custom ROMs and kernels.
*   **Device Takeover:** By obtaining code execution in Secure EL3, the attacker can control the entire device.
*   **Circumvention of Verified Boot:** The vulnerability can bypass the intended security of Android Verified Boot.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Modified raw\_resources Partition:** An attacker must modify the `raw_resources` partition on eMMC with crafted image data to control the arbitrary write.
*   **Battery Drain (SBL1):** To trigger the vulnerable SBL1 path, the battery must be discharged below 0%.
*   **Normal Boot (aboot):** Exploiting aboot can be done with a modified boot logo or other graphic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device.
*   **Ability to Modify eMMC:** The attacker must be able to flash a modified `raw_resources` partition to the eMMC storage of the device, either through kernel access, LG LAF or using a hardware flasher and soldered wires.
*   **Knowledge of Framebuffer Address:** The attacker needs to determine the framebuffer address in either SBL1 or aboot.
*   **(SBL1 Exploit) Controlled Battery Drain**: Requires ability to completely drain the battery.

**Additional Notes**
*   The signature within the `raw_resources` partition is only checked for verified boot images, and not for other resources such as the boot logo, charging animations etc..
*   The vulnerability exists in a wide range of LG devices, from the Nexus 5 up to LG Stylo 4 (Q710) and Stylo 5 (Q720), due to reused code for handling `raw_resources`.
*   The provided write-up includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for the LG Stylo 4 (Q710ULM).
