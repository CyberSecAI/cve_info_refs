Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient access control in Firefox content processes on Windows. Specifically, these processes were not properly isolated from each other, and a compromised process could gain elevated privileges to escape the sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inadequate DACL (Discretionary Access Control List):** The default DACL of content processes was too permissive, allowing a compromised process to open other content processes running at the same privilege level.
*   **Insufficient Token Restriction:** The `USER_LIMITED` token level was not restrictive enough, allowing a compromised content process to impersonate the main thread's token for privilege elevation.
*   **Lack of Process Isolation:** The content processes were not sufficiently isolated from each other, allowing a compromised process to access and control other content processes, bypassing the sandbox.
*   **Abuse of COM Servers:** The use of out-of-process COM servers with a privileged identity was exploited to bypass the Job object and child process mitigations, allowing a sandbox escape.
*  **UI Access Bypass:** Abusing a UAC "feature" to gain UI Access privilege was used to bypass UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation) and control the Explorer Run Dialog, enabling spawning processes outside of the sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows a compromised content process to:
*   **Sandbox Escape:** Escape the Firefox content process sandbox.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Elevate privileges to `USER_RESTRICTED_SAME_ACCESS` or higher by impersonating the main thread's initial token.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Execute arbitrary code outside the sandbox, potentially gaining control over the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A compromised content process (e.g., through an RCE vulnerability in a webpage or extension) can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker waits for a new content process to be created and then injects code into it and triggers the vulnerability to escalate privileges and escape the sandbox.
*   The exploit involves creating an out-of-process COM server with elevated privileges, abusing UAC, and using UI access to bypass UIPI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Compromised Content Process:** The attacker must first compromise a content process, typically through a separate vulnerability like a remote code execution (RCE) exploit.
*   **Ability to Inject Code:** The attacker needs the capability to inject code into the Firefox content process.
*   **Windows Environment:** This vulnerability specifically targets Firefox on Windows operating systems.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was reported by James Forshaw of Google Project Zero.
*   The fix involved using the `SetLockdownDefaultDacl` function and adding a restricting random SID (Security Identifier) in the sandbox policies.
*   The vulnerability was considered critical due to the ease of achieving a complete sandbox escape.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 76 and Firefox ESR 68.8.
*  The initial exploitation involved a race condition, where the attacker needed to open and take control of a new process before the sandbox could restrict its privileges
*   The issue was related to how Firefox was using Chromium's sandbox features, indicating a misconfiguration on Firefox's part.
*   The vulnerability was identified while implementing an exploit for a separate Windows kernel vulnerability and was initially targeted at Firefox's content sandbox.
*    The vulnerability highlighted the importance of strict process isolation and sufficient restrictions on access tokens.
* Running Firefox from a network drive required disabling the restricting SIDs, which led to a workaround using `AddUserSidForDenyOnly`.
*     The fix included a specific patch to fix a Gecko profiler issue when using SetLockdownDefaultDacl.
* The  root cause of the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper isolation between content processes and a too permissive initial state of the sandbox.

This detailed breakdown should provide a comprehensive understanding of CVE-2020-12388.
