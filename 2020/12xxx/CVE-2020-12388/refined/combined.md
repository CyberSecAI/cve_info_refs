| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

I can reproduce on a windows nightly asan build after letting the testcase reload loop run for a bit (sometimes it crashes quickly, sometimes takes a while). The stack on the crashing thread I get is a little different, but still a UAF read of 8 bytes somewhere in the CycleCollector. The allocation and freed stacks are the same as shown here.

Doesn't crash on an opt build. Haven't tried a debug build to see if there are any interesting assertions firing.

Thanks for checking. It is indeed being worked, but we're trying hard to avoid just pushing the signatures around. There are some systemic issues around worker shutdown that we're looking into.

That said, I don't think I'd fully processed [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1545345#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web Workers - Use After Free with XMLHttpRequest") indicating control over the instruction pointer. Can you clarify what build you reproduced that on? We may need to land a combination of changes that shunt this scenario to crashes or early failures.

We have a stack of patches in [bug 1559919](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559919 "RESOLVED FIXED - Finish the WorkerHolder cleanup") that we believe should improve worker invariants in general. We'll be trying to land these this week and mop up the rest of the related worker life-cycle invariants as well that aren't fixed. The particular concern for this bug is that IPC messages continued to be processed and run content-exposed code after they should (plus some extra complexities involving the sync loop).

I'm going to assume that [bug 1559919](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559919 "RESOLVED FIXED - Finish the WorkerHolder cleanup") isn't something we can uplift, so where does that leave us for Fx69/ESR68 for this bug? Is there anything we can do at least make this a safe crash there or something?

Massive apologies on the delays on this bug.

[Bug 1559919](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559919 "RESOLVED FIXED - Finish the WorkerHolder cleanup") did not address the invariant issues. So here's the current analysis and plans for imminent fixes:

## What the Test Case Is Doing

* Page:
  + Creates a worker.
  + Spams the worker using BroadcastChannel. The (emergent) intent of this is

    to trigger a synchronous XHR from inside

    DestroySyncLoop/ClearMainEventQueue, creating a nested clearing/syncloop

    destruction.
  + Triggers a page reload.
    - This results in an attempt to terminate the worker, although it's not

      clear that this is necessary for the reproduction.
    - This also just reloads the whole scenario, helping to increase the

      likelihood of a nested syncloop occurring thanks to broadcast channel.
* Worker:
  + Creates a BroadcastChannel listener whose (async) message handler initiates

    a synchronous XHR and then aborts it once it completes.
    - Both methods are WorkerThreadProxySyncRunnables which means they both

      create syncloops which means this widens the potenial for a nested

      syncloop to be created by the BroadcastChannel message.
    - These both end up needing to bounce to the main thread because that's

      where the canonical state lives. (Even if the XHR object should

      notionally not need to consult the main thread, it does unless the worker

      has reached cancellation state.)
  + Creates a file reader that configures the XHR for synchronous operation when

    the load completes (or aborts, as is the case in this situation.)
  + Creates the XHR (before close).
  + Calls self.close() which, because this is a top-level script load which

    means we're in a sync loop, causes a deferred invocation of

    ClearMainEventQueue and defers dispatching the cancel runnable. From a

    spec perspective, it should be impossible to ever dispatch another task to

    the worker after this point.
    - We previously had a safer behavior where we would fail to do a lot of

      things after this point that would be observable by other globals despite

      this global's inability to receive and process further tasks. We

      corrected this, allowing BroadcastChannel messages to be set, etc., and

      somewhat weakening our guards against dubious things happening after

      close() is called.
  + Calls FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer:
    - This is probably fine. This code intends to be a no-op when the worker is

      shutting down (and indeed, with close called, per spec, the load can never

      complete), but because the weak worker ref is tied to canceling, the

      closing state has no effect. But this is likely fine because the state

      per spec should advance to loading, and that is observable per the spec

      for abort() which will generate synchronous event dispatches.
    - This puts us in mReadyState of LOADING and triggers an async wait.
  + Calls FileReader.abort:
    - Because of the above call to readAsArrayBuffer, this does not fast-bail.

      We trigger a synchronous dispatch of the "loadend" event which triggers

      the logic to configure the XHR to be synchronous. It's not clear that

      the FileReader is entirely necessary to the reproduction, but this

      behavior does seem necessary per spec. (And is harmless unless I'm

      missing a nuance.)
  + The script reaches the end of its evaluation, which will cause the syncloop

    to attempt to unwind. Which means it will attempt to call

    ClearMainEventQueue. Unfortunately, BroadcastChannel operates on an IPC

    threading model and so doesn't get its event canceled. Instead its event

    gets processed and the logic in BroadcastChannelChild::RecvNotify's that

    calls only DOMEventTargetHelper::CheckCurrentGlobalCorrectness() to check

    the state of the worker ends up confused and dispatches an event that

    should never have been dispatched. (Although [bug 1455020](/show_bug.cgi?id=1455020 "RESOLVED FIXED - Extend CheckInnerWindowCorrectness() to check the state of the worker.") was notionally

    concerned about this when it renamed the method, it only added an

    mParentObject check. This check is really a check of whether

    WorkerGlobalScope::NoteTerminating() has been invoked which then calls

    DisconnectEventTargetObjects(). But NoteTerminating is only called when

    WorkerPrivate::NotifyInternal is invoked with a status >= Canceling, which

    Close is not. (And as noted above, the cancelling state is deferred. It

    only runs when DestroySyncLoop has returned from ClearMainEventQueue()!)).

## What Invariants Are Going Wrong

* BroadcastChannel is dispatching events when it should not be. This is the

  primary invariant violation here, as it's allowing content to be invoked on

  the stack when it's absolutely not expected to be invoked on the stack. It's

  depending on one of the following things to protect it:
  + Being wrapped into a WorkerRunnable so it gets canceled instead of run.

    (It's not because it's IPC and it's not using the hybrid event target.)
    - The control flow for canceling WorkerRunnables is extra insane, as it

      depends on WorkerRunnable::Run() noticing that

      WorkerPrivate::AllPendingRunnablesShouldBeCanceled() returns true. Normal

      runnables just run.
    - Unfortunately event hybrid event target wrapping is semantically

      problematic because it coerces the normal runnables into control

      runnables.
  + Having DOMEventTargetHelper protect it from dispatching the event. (It's

    not because DOMEventTargetHelper's guard is only effective once the worker

    has reached the Canceling state, which it has not because the event is

    being invoked inside the syncloop destruction which will only advance to

    the canceling state after the event loop is drained.)
    - It is reasonable to enforce that ClearMainEventQueue should preclude

      event dispatch to occur while clearing the queue. We should either fail

      to dispatch or crash. It's arguably reasonable to enforce this at both

      the DETH level as well as the global level.
    - From a semantics level, it makes sense to explicitly have checks for

      whether it's currently legal to call into content and whether it's legal

      to enqueue tasks. Unfortunately, both self.close() and syncloops throw

      wrenches into clear state transitions here. close() definitely precludes

      future task enqueueing. And syncloop unwinding definitely creates

      intervals where calls into content are indicative of fatal invariant

      violations (specifically, when clearing the event queue).
* DestroySyncLoop isn't preventing reentrancy into the mSyncLoopStack.IsEmpty()

  actions, although, again, it's the calls into content that are forcing the

  issue.
  + The double-dispatch of the CancelingRunnables is notionally idempotent and

    okay in terms of reference counting, it's really just the event loop

    clearing that causes issues.
* XMLHttpRequestWorker.cpp's EventRunnable::WorkerRun takes a copy of

  mProxy's raw, non-owning pointer and passes it onwards to

  ProgressEvent::Constructor or NS\_NewDOMEvent, both of whom derive an owning

  RefPtr or nsCOMPtr. This enables a use-after-free on XMLHttpRequestWorker in

  the event of apparent event reordering. This is a thing that's possible when

  you have re-entrancy of syncloop destruction/content invocation on top of a

  syncloop, as this cancels all runnables after the current runnable when our

  invariants expect this to be impossible, allowing naive assumptions of

  strong-refs being held by things that can only be deleted chronologically in a

  future turn of the event loop being violated.
  + NB: I need to explain this better. To restate somewhat more explicitly:

    sync calls from workers assume that no content re-entrancy can occur. The

    whole point of the nested event queues and syncloops is that no content

    re-entrancy ever occurs. This limits the ability to create mismatched

    ownership situations because any GC or strong references on the stack before

    the code went synchronous continue to exist.

## So The (Non)Action Items

* The IPC/runnable issue is important but hard to address because of the

  divergence between what the Cache API expects in terms of semantics (IPC is

  chrome privileged) and what implementations like BroadcastChannel expect

  (IPC is content privileged, roughly speaking).
* Preventing calls into content JS when no longer appropriate is therefore

  paramount. This can be addressed from multiple sides:
  + ClearEventQueue can 100% inhibit calls into JS by DETH or any code until

    explicitly cleared.
  + DOMEventTargetHelper can be made to understand when it is being used in a

    context that is explicitly synchronously reentrant from content, versus when

    it is being used in an explicitly asynchronous fashion. This is a unique

    distinction for workers, but a necessary and fundamental distinction in the

    face of `self.close()`. APIs such as BroadcastChannel and MessageChannel

    have explicitly async dispatches (at least for our IPC handlers; there

    may be some edge-cases for MessageChannels for freshly created channels that

    haven't had their ports shipped/entangled/etc.). In these cases, any

    attempt shoudl 100% fail after self.close() is called. The only wackiness

    we allow with sync XHR/etc. is that the stack be unwound. No further

    tasks should ever get to run.
* The syncloop reentrancy/mPostSyncLoopOperations-double-invocation needs harder

  guards that ensure we aren't allowed to start a new syncloop while popping the

  current one. A lesser option would be to reorder the stack consultation so

  that we noticed we're at 1 to sensitize for the call but don't actually pop

  down to 0 until the return, which would result in the nested seeing a 2->1

  transition instead of an additional, duplicative 1->0 transition, but it's

  really not okay to be pushing an additional syncloop. (Syncloops should only

  be allowed to be entered when in content, but it's not okay to be in content

  at that time.)

I'll attempt to get a candidate set of fixes with appropriate reproduction confirmations of this tomorrow. (That is, the reproduction should properly trigger failsafe assertions in the initial draft of the patch, and then the reproduction should only generate errors in the second draft of the patch wherein the invariants are properly guarded against without triggering the backstop crashing assertions.) This may spill into Friday as I try and better validate that I understand how the actual use-after-free is occurring.

I'm experiencing difficulty right now reproducing on nightly under linux64 opt, debug, or opt asan under both reproduction test cases including with a release assert on calling into JS content when ClearMainEventQueue and running asan and opt under rr (primarily attempting to offset my fast multi-core machine by serializing execution). And this includes running multiples tabs concurrently.

We did correct our worker thread priority from being below-normal to normal though (which I think is a significant priority difference on windows), so it's likely we've made it harder to reproduce the exact situation in question.

Tomorrow I'll endeavor to create a variation that just spams BroadcastChannel messages to trigger content re-entrancy in syncloop unwinding after self.close() is involved. That should be sufficient to validate the hard backstop content re-entrancy guards and the broadcast channel DOMEventTargetHelper guards. Once that's working (and those guards disabled again) it should be simple enough to expose an oracle to content to let it know when to trigger a nested syncloop and to verify we avoid attempting to perform the last-syncloop actions twice.

I'll also pursue local windows builds since that's the platform of greatest concern. Also if anyone has any recent reproduction backtraces on hand, please do paste/attach them to the bug as it would be useful to help account for code drift. (But no need to go out of your way. It's clear the content re-entrancy issues continues to exist even if it's somewhat harder to reproduce them.)

Status update:

* Reproducing BroadcastChannel re-entrancy is in fact very easy. I created a mochitest for reproduction assistance.
* Reproducing the GC problem that led to the crash has been harder against trunk, so I'm planning to reproduce on the original revision and then potentially bisect a bit.
  + In my [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1545345#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web Workers - Use After Free with XMLHttpRequest") analysis I was overly focused on the re-entrancy invariants and that Yaron's ASAN repro provided evidence of this, but I'm still trying to reconstruct how we could end up with both an XMLHttpRequestWorker in the snow-white list that gets MaybeKillObject()ed (meaning it has a 0 refcount at the time of deletion) as well as have the dom::Event whose underlying WidgetEvent has an nsCOMPtr reference to the same XMLHttpRequestWorker itself be in the snow-white list. By rolling back to the code at the time of a known repro, I hope to reproduce under rr/pernosco and then leverage that to create a more targeted reproducing test and verify how that applies to trunk through the impending release.

The key things here are:

* We have a sync event dispatch on the stack into JS space. The dispatch to the target does not have a kung fu death grip and assumes that mProxy continues to hold a strong ref to the XHRW.
* WE ARE PROCESSING CONTROL RUNNABLES IN THE MIDDLE OF ARBITRARY JS CONTENT IN THE INTERRUPT CALLBACK.
* WE ARE DISCONNECTING THE EVENT TARGETS IN THE MIDDLE OF SYNCHRONOUS EVENT DISPATCH.

Some of these things are concerning. I leave it as an exercise to the reader to infer which ones most terrifyingly are violating invariants...

Note that the intents here I think are reasonable. We do want to ensure that an infinite looping worker can be terminated by its parent/owner. That's absolutely reasonable. However, much like the syncloop semantics that defer the actual ramifications of self.close() until the stack is successfully unwound, we should not be actually undertaking the teardown of the global in this manner while we have potentially multiple syncloops on the stack as well as event dispatch. (However, it's fine to ensure that all JS content frames for the global immediately error all the way up the stack... the idea is just that much like the cycle collector hygienically defers the actual deletion of objects, it's wiser for us to defer DETH-disconnect and strong reference dropping until there's no longer any content and naive C++ frames on the stack. Although we should ensure kung fu grips are held in places where they aren't currently held but should be held...)

The particular test I used to reproduce this problem has also resulted in the given scenario happening inside asymmetrically paired Pin/Unpin calls, so that may also be involved or the dominant issue. I'll look into that tomorrow as well.

Attempts to re-create this on trunk post-landing of [bug 1588248](/show_bug.cgi?id=1588248 "RESOLVED FIXED - Assertion failure: !mProxy->mSyncLoopTarget, at src/dom/xhr/XMLHttpRequestWorker.cpp:1416") seem to indicate that the problem has been mitigated since that landed in 72. I believe the particular permutation of events was the Sync XHR on the stack twice with the DETH global destruction on the stack (and then multiple Unpin calls lined up). Since it's no longer possible to get the same Sync XHR on the stack twice, the UAF is mitigated.

I'm going to start putting up patches later today with variants of

1. Allow the global to mark when JS shouldn't run.
2. Have BroadcastChannel/friends check to not even bother trying to run JS in the closing state.
3. Defer global destruction until the stack has actually unwound.

Any of the 3 would have prevented the problem, although all 3 are required for sanity/correctness.

No, we want :baku's review as well. I've upgraded his review request to blocking to make that clear.

Relatedly, has our taskcluster migration given us a private try server that we can safely push security fixes to in order to have better test coverage than my local testing?

I'm currently running additional local tests against trunk and ESR68. :RyanVM indicated via other channels that there is not currently a private try server available.

The exact test-case no longer reproduced, but I've been concerned about other potential syncloop gadgets so now after some assistance from :jkratzer I'm pursuing directed fuzzing. The question I'm trying to answer is whether we've already mitigated the class of UAFs initially seen on this bug, and if so, on which releases it's mitigated. The rationale is that there is some level of analytic complexity risk from the fix and it would be preferable to land it on trunk only, at least initially.

|  | |

And by class of UAFs I mean:

* MessageChannel/BroadcastChannel allow content to run during syncloop destruction.
* Syncloop-using APIs are called during syncloop destruction in a way that allows for use-after-frees due to bad assumptions in syncloop-using code. (This may have required bad assumptions in conjunction with unsafe uses of raw pointers in cases that erroneously assume the raw pointer usage was covered by a strong reference.)

Sounds like this might be too risky to land late in the beta cycle, so I'll call it wontfix for 75; hopefully we can have it bake some more on 76.

Comment on [attachment 9130470](/attachment.cgi?id=9130470 "Bug 1545345 - Improve worker shutdown. r=baku,smaug") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9130470&action=edit "Bug 1545345 - Improve worker shutdown. r=baku,smaug")

[Bug 1545345](/show_bug.cgi?id=1545345 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web Workers - Use After Free with XMLHttpRequest") - Improve worker shutdown. r=baku,smaug

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Not 100% clear at this time. It's possible that the landing of [bug 1588248](/show_bug.cgi?id=1588248 "RESOLVED FIXED - Assertion failure: !mProxy->mSyncLoopTarget, at src/dom/xhr/XMLHttpRequestWorker.cpp:1416") (which is now on all supported branches including ESR68) solved the only UAF. I'm attempting local fuzzing to see if other issues might exist, but we can consider sec-approval in parallel to me finishing that up.

This patch is about closing holes that definitely result in invariants being violated. We do know how to violate the invariants from tests, we don't know how to cause a UAF.

If someone suspects that the patch might be related to a secbug, they might be suspicious of things involving syncloops and content re-entrancy. This would give them a general idea of what to pursue, but various things that have landed (workers run at higher priorities, we do more global checks, etc.) should have upped the difficulty level.

We do have bugs on generally improving the state of workers so we could try and land this under the auspices of a bug like [bug 1539508](/show_bug.cgi?id=1539508 "NEW - [meta] Simplify WorkerPrivate's end-of-life flow").

* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Unknown
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: esr68?
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: The patch was intentionally designed to not be risky, but it's still touching/fixing stuff that's scary. In discussion with RyanVM (and his discussions), we've been talking about letting this just ride the train on nightly to beta and in general seeing how it bakes.

We assume they will identify security patches since the check-in comment will have a bug reference that's not accessible, or suspiciously omit the bug number. The latter is bad for us in the future ("why is this here?") so please do put in the bug number.

My local test matrix was primarily using ASAN for most directories, missing the fact that normal `MOZ_ASSERT`s will not fire in that case although many other DEBUG-only things are run under ASAN. I've corrected the sanity-checking assertion locally and am locally re-running impacted tests under a full DEBUG build and will re-submit shortly.

I've consulted with :sfink on the hazard analysis which did not like the QueryInterface calls performed in <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/8526066f548af9ec3ebb462ff73c47ccc183f533/js/xpconnect/wrappers/WrapperFactory.cpp#843>. This call previously didn't matter because the unrooted `realCallback` was not used beyond the call. But with the forbidden script check refactoring, it is.

Given the analytical issues involved, we've opted to go with rooting `realCallback`. Since the patch has already been rendered public already by the 2 bounced landings, I've pushed a hazard analysis job to try and will re-land assuming that comes back green:

I am attempting to verify this fix, but I am having trouble creating the server correctly. Can you provide more detailed steps (or a tutorial that I could understand) on the server creation part? My skills stop at the creation of the Simple HTTP server. Thank you.

A number of other accidentally mitigating fixes have meant that the reproducing test cases haven't worked for a very long time. We're still pursuing fuzzer improvements to help provide confirmation of the fixes, but for now the fix can't be verified.

Patch is now updated for ESR68 in that separate phabricator request. I did some local testing with a debug build and explicitly including the test that caused the initial landing bounce. I did not push to try. I requested the uplift approval in case that's desired.

#### [#CVE-2020-12392: Arbitrary local file access with 'Copy as cURL'](#CVE-2020-12392)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP POST data of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as cURL' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in the disclosure of local files.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer, philipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, André Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Firefox: Default Content Process DACL Sandbox Escape

Platform: Firefox 73.0.1 and 75.0a1, 64-bit on Windows 10 1809/1909 (not tested earlier OS versions).

Class: Elevation of Privilege

Summary: The Firefox content processes do not sufficiently lockdown access control which can result in a sandbox escape.

Description:

According to <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox> the current content process sandbox is Level 5 which runs with Chromium token level of USER\_LIMITED. However, USER\_LIMITED is sufficient to open any of the other content processes running at the same time.

The ability to open another process presents a problem, the initial token is set to USER\_RESTRICTED\_SAME\_ACCESS. If a content process is compromised via an RCE then an attack waits for a new content process to be created (there’s also likely a way of making a new content process start programmatically) the process can be opened before the initial thread token is dropped with the call to LowerToken and the attack can run as USER\_RESTRICTED\_SAME\_ACCESS.

Even though the content process runs as a Low Integrity Level this access is sufficient to escape the sandbox. There’s likely to be multiple routes to escape but one which works that I’ve provided as a POC is as follows:

1. Wait for a new content process to start. Immediately suspend the process.
2. Impersonate the main thread’s initial token to elevate privileges.
3. Create an out-of-process COM server using the privileged identity to escape the process Job object. This also bypasses the child process mitigation as that’s set on the primary token, not the impersonation token.
4. Migrate to the new COM server process, abuse a UAC “feature” documented at <https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2019/02/accessing-access-tokens-for-uiaccess.html> which allows us to create a new process with UI Access privilege under our control.
5. Use UI Access to bypass UIPI and programmatically access the Explorer Run Dialog to spawn a process outside of the sandbox.

Fixing wise, you should be able to call the Chromium sandbox target policy function SetLockdownDefaultDacl to restrict the access between content processes. Note that it’s possible this will cause some system code to fail, you’ll need to do extensive testing to make sure it’s not a problem.

On a related topic I’d also recommend calling:

sandbox::ApplyProcessMitigationsToCurrentProcess(sandbox::MITIGATION\_HARDEN\_TOKEN\_IL\_POLICY).

In the main browser process. This prevents related token stealing attacks, which while mostly mitigated in Windows could still pose a risk. This can be done in slow time, it doesn’t have to be part of this fix.

Proof of Concept:

I’ve provided a PoC as a Visual Studio 2019 project. It contains a C# DLL injector and a C++ DLL which will be injected into a running copy of Firefox. The exploit will send details to the debug output which you can capture using Sysinternals Debug View.

Note, I’ve tested this on the latest stable as well as Nightly. It seems at least in Nightly it hits a release assert at <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/ipc/glue/Transport_win.h#68> if debugging, continuing the execution the exploit still works. I think this assert is probably due to the process suspension, though it’s not entirely clear. I’m of the opinion that it doesn’t block the exploit, and is not really related.

1. Compile the VS2019 solution project as Release build, x64. The C# It will need to grab the NtApiDotNet library from NuGet to work.
2. Copy the DLL from x64\Release and InjectDll.exe and NtApiDotNet.dll from InjectDll\bin\Release to a generally accessible directory (say C:\Test).
3. Start a copy of Firefox running.
4. From a command line run InjectDll.exe FirefoxSandboxEscape.dll. Check that prints a PID, this is the process the code has injected into which should be a sandboxed content process.
5. In firefox create a new tab and navigate to a new web page. This should cause a new content process to be created for the exploit to hijack. A command prompt running at medium should appear.

Expected Result:

Code running in one content process should not be able to open other content processes.

Observed Result:

Content process is opened, initial thread token repurposes and sandbox escaped.

This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapse,

the bug report will become visible to the public. The scheduled disclosure

date is 2020-05-28. Disclosure at an earlier date is also possible if

agreed upon by all parties.

Yes, that describes the fundamental issue and our problems with deploying that fix.

The only outstanding issue that we know about is a performance one.

There is another (I believe DirectWrite) performance issue when we have acceleration enabled, but not webrender.

James however gives a much more extensive account of how this can be abused - thanks for the detailed report.

Our original concern was access to other running content processes with different trust levels from the parent (or indeed privileges in the case of the file content process).

The ease of complete escape might mean we need to swallow those performance problems though.

Would it be possible to be added to issue 1554110 to see the discussion, or does it contain other sensitive information? I'm investigating possible better fixes at the Chromium repo level so understanding of issues would be useful.

Thanks for adding me on to the other bug. I'm currently working on a change to Chromium. In summary in entails:

* Generating a random SID and adding that as a new restricted SID.
* Added the random SID granting full access into the default DACL.
* Use SetLockdownDefaultDacl to remove the other DACL access.

This should provide isolation of processes, threads and their resources from each other running at the same level as long as the each process gets a random SID. However the process will be able to access itself, this should hopefully fix issues with DirectWrite cache, although of course that will get broken at some point if you decide to drop to a lower privilege. I've no idea on the impact of the audio service though. Enabling this will still be optional, it won't be applied to everything just in case of breakage.

It won't stop a process opening another at a similar level which doesn't employ these tricks, so for example an IE PM process running at the same time would still be accessible, but there's not much you can do about that other than running in a more restrictive sandbox.

I'll let you know when I having something in the Chromium repo to test. Of course if you have other ideas it'd be good to know.

Thanks James, no other ideas at the moment, but I'm continuing to try and track down the other performance regressions.

Sounds like that will definitely render my OpenProcessToken fix unnecessary, hopefully it will sort the other performance regressions as well.

We were already planning to break the DirectWrite cache deliberately at some point assuming that we would hit the same reconnection issue that you had, but we'll probably only do that when we have the accelerated rendering moved to the GPU process.

I've implemented the new sandbox feature in Chromium. [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/c1ce57ea5d31208af589b4839390a44ab20b0c8f](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/%2B/c1ce57ea5d31208af589b4839390a44ab20b0c8f).

I don't know what you're process is to merge in updates. To enable you'd need to call both SetLockdownDefaultDacl() and AddRestrictingRandomSid() on the sandbox policy.

Thanks for the speedy implementation.

We normally take full updates, with some shimmed files to reduce dependency creep.

We also have a set of our own patches for various reasons.

In cases like these, I'll try and merge in just that update, we're not too far behind, so hopefully it won't be too painful.

Local testing with James's fix looks good, thanks again for this!

* Audio issue appears to be fixed on Windows 7 even without cubeb sandbox (remote audio) enabled
* Gecko profiler issue with stacks fixed
* Performance issues appear to be fixed, although it's a little difficult to be sure of this with local runs. Given that I tried to land the SetLockdownDefaultDacl fix on [bug 1557282](/show_bug.cgi?id=1557282 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add SetLockdownDefaultDacl to the content process sandbox policy for Windows.") (an open bug) last year and I have pushed try pushes with various attempts to fix performance issues I didn't think pushing this fix to try added any new risk. Performance issues appear to be fixed:

  <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&selectedJob=291846719&revision=3576fb045d820f0fcb977a916d7e6391d6826d24>

As far as I can see, we'll need to add these settings to all of our sandboxed processes, because if a way can be found to cause them to start (or restart) then they would also be initially running at low integrity and with a permissive access token. So, I think I'm going to have to push a full try push with those changes added, to get some test coverage. My feeling is that if the content process issues are fixed, we have a reasonable chance it won't cause issues in other processes.

One concern I have is when firefox is being run from a network drive.

For legacy reasons a number of people expect this to work.

When we detect this we stop using restricting SIDs in the access tokens, instead just relying on deny only settings.

For some reason, we never got to the bottom of, restricting SIDs don't seem to work for certain things when accessing a network drive.

As the random SID is only added as a restricting SID, it's obviously not there when we're not using them.

James - in the case above is there an easy way (with existing sandbox code or otherwise) to add the random SID to the Access Token as a normal SID, so we still keep access to our own process?

Unfortunately it's not really possible to add arbitrary groups, at least not without running with SeTcbPrivilege which basically requires you to be running a system service. The problem with UNC paths is by default Windows blocks access to network resources from restricted tokens, regardless of how much access those tokens have. i.e. even if you add every SID restricted as you have in the list of groups it won't. I believe there's a system setting you could change to allow this to work but of course that'd have to be enabled by the user.

From a unprivileged user process really the only possibility would be to disable the sandbox in your current implementation. There might be a theoretical possibility to use AppContainers on modern Windows 10 versions (which is supported in the Chromium sandbox) but that's fraught with difficult as well.

Could you try the POC I sent to ensure it breaks with the new sandbox changes? I've don't manual analysis in Chrome but not full end to end testing in FF.

Thanks, I guess we have two other choices then, dveditz, tjr - what do you think?:

* Don't lockdown the dacl when running from a network drive, even though that fundamentally weakens the sandbox.
* Land the other fix for the gecko profiler stack issue and just leave the performance problems when we're running from a network drive. Of course there is a chance this will cause other currently unknown issues, but maybe that is better than having a known effectively unsandboxed browser.

> Could you try the POC I sent to ensure it breaks with the new sandbox changes? I've don't manual analysis in Chrome but not full end to end testing in FF.

I've compiled up the POC in VS2017 and checked that it was working without the fix.

With the fix the injected into process crashes, but the medium integrity command prompt doesn't appear.

You can still apply the DACL lockdown, but without the restricting SIDs it won't have any effect. The fix I implemented relies on both a token being sufficiently restricted and the potential target processes running with a restricted DACL. If you've effectively turned off the Restricted SIDs then you'll no longer prevent other processes from opening each other.

As for the POC I'm not sure it should crash, but I guess I've not actually checked it running. Is there a way of getting a test build so I can verify myself? Alternatively I can provide some instruction on using some of my analysis tools in PowerShell which you can use to verify process access.

Ah, I guess the User's SID isn't set to deny only.

You could use the build from the try push:

<https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/api/queue/v1/task/IKBzjJx4ReCaH6BkeHZ5Tg/runs/0/artifacts/public/build/install/sea/target.installer.exe>

That only has the fix enabled for content processes and I think your injection could pick up any child process because of the confusing -contentproc arg (which I think actually means we're using firefox.exe and not plugin-container.exe or something), if you also added command contains or possibly ends with "tab", then you should be guaranteed to get a content process.

I tried this by flipping the flag to always not use restricting SIDs and sure enough the fix no longer works (the exploit starts working again, I had to tweak it a bit to inject into processes without a restricted token).

However, I added into the USER\_LIMITED code when not using restricted SIDs: `restricted_token.AddUserSidForDenyOnly();` and that was enough for it to block the exploit again.

I'm not sure what else that might break, in theory for the normal case we don't have the User's SID because it's not in the restricted set, but Windows permissions can be unpredictable in some cases.

I wouldn't recommend blocking the user SID through a deny only, at least if you want anything to work correctly. Certainly opening the process would almost certainly fail, although it'll seem to work from in-process because there's a sandbox hook to handle it. The big issue with system services comes down to making a call to a service, that service impersonates the caller then tries to open the calling process which fails.

Right, we're back to the same regressions as before, one of which I have a fix for and the other performance ones caused presumably by the mechanism you describe.

However, having a performance hit only when running from a network drive, is probably better than having a totally compromised sandbox in that case. We may of course find other things that are broken in other ways than just performance.

I've tested running from a network drive with the User's SID set to deny only and that does stop the POC.

Things seemed to work OK.

I tried things that run the various different child processes.

It was slow, but that mainly seemed to be down to running from the network rather than this change.

So, I propose to land these patches using open [bug 1557282](/show_bug.cgi?id=1557282 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add SetLockdownDefaultDacl to the content process sandbox policy for Windows."), given that has already had related traffic on it.

Two try pushes:

<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&duplicate_jobs=visible&selectedJob=291996630&revision=29d18576ca967f5ec79c491beed287f008cc5f3d>

The first shows that adding this to the socket process breaks tests, the second is without the settings on the socket process.

I don't think we need to worry about that immediately, because:

* the socket process isn't shipping just yet (although it is soon)
* it starts before any other child processes and as far as I can tell currently doesn't attempt to restart, if that changes, which I guess it may well, then we'll need to work out what the settings are breaking

Not adding the rules to the socket process, has the added bonus of meaning all three patches apply to Beta and Release cleanly.

Unfortunately not ESR68 though, I'm having trouble getting that to build locally at the moment.

I've reproduced with the POC on a Beta and Release build and tested it was blocked with the new settings.

I'll upload the proposed patches to this bug first.

SetLockdownDefaultDacl, apart from when we are running from a network drive.

[Bug 1557282 Part 2: Fix profiler issues when using SetLockdownDefaultDacl. r=dmajor!](attachment.cgi?id=9131514&action=diff)

When we are running from a network drive the new feature in part 1 doesn't work.

So this uses DuplicateHandle instead of OpenThread to get the thread handle used

by the profiler.

It also removes a DuplicateHandle THREAD\_ALL\_ACCESS call that also fails and a

DuplicateHandle to get a real process handle, which only seems to have been to

fix something on Windows XP.

The handle passed in is always the profiler one, so already has the necessary

permissions. If no thread handle is passed then the pseudo handle is used.

Finally won my fight with the ESR68 build, patches incoming.

I can see the permissions being set properly, but even without them the POC doesn't seem to work for some reason.

I worked out what was going wrong in the POC for esr68.

In RunExploit `HANDLE proc` was uninitialised and it was then picking up a terminated process and trying to suspend it.

Why this only caused a problem for esr68, I'm not sure.

When I initialised it to nullptr the POC started working and is blocked with the ESR68 patches attached.

I also realised this morning that this is wrong, because we ought to also worry about already running compromised low integrity processes (another firefox instance for example or chrome GPU process (much less likely to be compromised I know)). If firefox with the socket process is then opened the exploit works as the socket process initialises.

One way to break this exploit at least is to run the socket process at USER\_LIMITED from the start, this seems to break the creation of the out-of-process COM server I think.

The media socket process tests still work locally.

One other idea I had was to start the socket process at medium integrity not low (to prevent it being opened), before dropping to untrusted, but this breaks the tests.

I'll try the USER\_LIMITED change on try with the socket process tests and update patch part 3 later, as I see no reason not to do this if it doesn't break anything.

James - do you think starting the socket process without the locked down dacl but at USER\_LIMITED from the start is enough of a mitigation here or do we need to work out why the dacl lockdown is breaking things? (My guess is that it is to do with socket opens, but I haven't proved that.)

Try push with USER\_LIMITED from start of socket process. Just socket process tests (spi):

Try push with the socket process using USER\_LIMITED from the start looks good.

I've decided to upload this as a fourth part, because it wouldn't need to be uplifted as the socket process is only enabled on Nightly at the moment.

By the way, I've tried to get everything ready for landing because I will have some time today and tomorrow to work on this, but I'm then on PTO from Monday.

Sorry for the buggy POC.

The fix is all best efforts IMO. At the current FF's content sandbox level (and Chromium GPU) I'm sure they're probably still a way out given enough time and effort spent. Chromium has the advantage that finding a GPU RCE is slightly more difficult than finding a renderer sandbox escape so that's the only reason it's less of a concern (however I did enable the lockdown in Chromium on Friday).

I think the biggest risk is the initial token, if you can get it working with USER\_LIMITED then that's a good idea. Still would be interesting to find out why your tests are failing as it might identity some new misfeature in Windows which needs to be taken into consideration in the future.

Thanks, looks like we can use USER\_LIMITED from the start for the socket process.

Hopefully when I get back I can find out what is broken in the socket process with the locked down dacl.

James, what's the Chrome disclosure timeline on this? If we ship the fix in Firefox 76 (scheduled for 2020-05-05), is that early enough? (It should be per the timeline in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1618911#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox: Default Content Process DACL Sandbox Escape"), just want to make sure that still stands.)

Disclosure wise the Project zero issue will be opened on 2020-05-28 as per the original report. We recently changed our policy and you get the whole 90 days from reporting date before the issues are disclosed. 2020-05-05 should therefore more than meet schedule.

From the Chrome (non-P0) perspective the fixes are merged into Canary/Dev but the issue is not public and won't be for a similar time period. However the fixes don't make any reference to FF in any way.

From discussion, there's an additional complication: for ESR 68, when we're on a network drive and use the fallback fix, we can't rely on AudioIPC to fix the audio issues. So that configuration might end up with broken audio. Not sure how common that configuration is, but Enterprise environments might be exactly the situation where running from a network drive happens. Blergh!

I've tested running ESR68 from a network drive with the patches applied on two windows 10 installations and audio appears to be working OK.

Given [bug 1567662](/show_bug.cgi?id=1567662 "RESOLVED FIXED - No audio on Firefox Nightly on Windows 10"), from the last time I tried to land this (without the new chromium fix), I suspect that there will be some cases where it is broken.

On windows 7 ESR68 from a network drive had broken audio.

It appeared to be working fine when running locally.

RyanVM reminded me that this isn't in ESR68 yet.

The patches landed using publicly open [bug 1557282](/show_bug.cgi?id=1557282 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add SetLockdownDefaultDacl to the content process sandbox policy for Windows.").

The fixes for this don't seem to have caused any issues on Nightly or Beta Fx76 as far as I know.

We know that we will get some problems with broken audio on ESR68 when running from a network drive (Firefox binaries installed on a network share).

That's because we don't have the benefit of cubeb remoting there.

The preferred fix for this, if people can't live with broken audio, is to install Firefox locally on the machine or possibly use Release version if the network installation is a must.

Is everyone happy that we should still take this on ESR68 given the security implications?

If we are, then I'll get the patches updated with any further rebasing / review comments and get them uploaded to [bug 1557282](/show_bug.cgi?id=1557282 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add SetLockdownDefaultDacl to the content process sandbox policy for Windows.") for uplift approval.

The blog is not about this issue. I identified this issue while implementing the exploit chain for the Windows kernel bug in that blog post. I originally targeted FF's Content Sandbox, but the blog post I only briefly mention FF and focus on Chrome to avoid people looking too closely. The P0 issue for this vulnerability is still hidden and within the 90 days of disclosure.

Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer, philipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, André Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
