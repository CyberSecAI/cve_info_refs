|  | 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2020-12256) |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | The rConfig 3.9.4 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The devicemgmnt.php file improperly validates the request coming from the user input. Due to this flaw, An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting arbitrary javascript |
|  | ("><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>) in `deviceId` GET parameter of devicemgmnt.php resulting in execution of the |
|  | javascript. |
|  |  |
|  | Step To Reproduce-: |
|  |  |
|  | 1. Login with the credential. |
|  | 2. Go to https://ip-rconfig/devicemgmt.php?deviceId="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2020-12259) |
|  |  |
|  | The rConfig 3.9.4 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The configDevice.php file improperly validates the request coming from the user input. Due to this flaw, An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting arbitrary javascript |
|  | ("><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>) in `rid` GET parameter of devicemgmnt.php resulting in execution of the javascript. |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | Steps To Reproduce-: |
|  |  |
|  | 1. Go to https://ip-rconfig/configDevice.php?rid="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | 1. Session Fixation (CVE-2020-12258) |
|  |  |
|  | The rConfig is vulnerable to session fixation. Due to the lack of randomization of the session and reuse session(prior login, after login). |
|  | An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by chaining with XSS.he can set the user session and would take control of the user's account. |
|  |  |
|  | Steps To Reproduce-: |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | 1. you can confirm the same session by checking prior login and after logging |
|  | 2. Now try to trigger the XSS by setting the session |
|  | (https://ip-rconfig/configDevice.php?rid="><script>document.cookie="PHPSESSID=123456789"</script>). |
|  | 3. you can observe that session id has been set as of our choice. |
