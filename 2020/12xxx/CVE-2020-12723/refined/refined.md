{
    "CVE-2020-12723": {
        "description": "The vulnerability is caused by recursive calls to `S_study_chunk()` in Perl's regular expression compiler, which could corrupt the intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression, potentially allowing an attacker to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression. This flaw occurs when Perl's regular expression compiler calls S_study_chunk() in a recursive fashion to optimize the intermediate language representation of a regular expression.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Corruption of intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression.",
             "Insertion of instructions into the compiled form of a regular expression.",
            "Denial of Service."
         ],
        "impact": "An attacker could abuse this behavior to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression, or cause a denial of service.",
        "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted regular expression to the Perl regular expression compiler, specifically when untrusted regular expressions are compiled.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to supply a crafted regular expression to the Perl regular expression compiler. This requires the ability to influence the regular expressions that are compiled by the target application. This vulnerability is not about matching an untrusted text, but compiling an untrusted regular expression."
