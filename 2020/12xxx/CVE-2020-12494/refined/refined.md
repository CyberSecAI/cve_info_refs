- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Beckhoff TwinCAT RT network driver for Intel 8254x and 8255x does not properly pad Ethernet frames with payloads smaller than the minimum Ethernet frame size. Instead of padding with zeros or a fixed pattern, it uses arbitrary memory content.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200). The driver transmits arbitrary memory content within the padding bytes of undersized Ethernet frames. This memory content may contain slices of previously transmitted or received frames.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary memory content from the affected device. While the attacker cannot directly control which memory is exposed, this may reveal sensitive data.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends Ethernet frames with payloads smaller than the minimum frame size to the affected device. This can be achieved using ICMP echo requests or other small packets.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device. No special privileges or authentication is required.
