- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `file.php` script where the `file` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate it to traverse directories outside of the intended scope.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `file` parameter containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an unauthenticated attacker can access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `file.php` script. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
