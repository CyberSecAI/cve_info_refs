- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A certificate validation handler, introduced in Zulip Desktop 0.5.10 to support the `ignoreCerts` option, inadvertently disabled all certificate validation except during initial server association.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper certificate validation. The application was not validating certificates, thus making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could perform man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially intercepting and modifying communications between the Zulip desktop client and the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, such as man-in-the-middle.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Zulip Desktop client and the server. This could be on the same local network or by controlling a network device in the traffic path.
