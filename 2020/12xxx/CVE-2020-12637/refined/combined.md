# Zulip Desktop 5.2.0 security release

  [![](/_astro/anders.C7YvkPz3_2eFAUl.webp)](author/anders/)  [Anders Kaseorg](author/anders/)   May 6, 2020 • 2 min read

Today we released Zulip Desktop 5.2.0, fixing a critical security issue:

* CVE-2020-12637: Zulip Desktop 0.5.10 introduced a certificate validation
  handler to support the undocumented `ignoreCerts` option available by manually
  editing the configuration file. However, the handler inadvertently disabled
  all certificate validation, whether or not `ignoreCerts` was enabled, except
  during initial association with the server.

The Zulip security team discovered this issue during internal auditing. All
versions of Zulip Desktop from 0.5.10 through 5.1.0 are affected.

We have fixed the validation handler to correctly respect the `ignoreCerts`
option, which safely defaults to `false`. We do not recommend enabling the
`ignoreCerts` option, and we expect to remove it completely in a future release.
(Administrators of self-hosted servers should install a valid certificate, as we
have always recommended; see our documentation on
[using Certbot](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/ssl-certificates.html#certbot-recommended).)

This release also includes the following changes since 5.1.0:

* Upstream dependencies have been upgraded to the latest releases, including
  Electron 8.2.5.
* An [issue](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-desktop/issues/947) where
  downloading a file caused the file chooser dialog to open twice has been
  fixed.
* A helper has been added to enable an improved social login flow that runs in
  the default web browser rather than inside the app. The new flow is available
  now in Zulip Cloud and in self-hosted servers running from Git master, which
  will become the upcoming Zulip Server 2.2 release.

## Upgrading

All installations should upgrade to this latest release as soon as possible.
Installations with the default automatic upgrades enabled will be upgraded to
the new release when next launched.
