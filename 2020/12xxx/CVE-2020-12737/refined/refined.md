Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in Rumpus version 8.2.11 on macOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically in the URL, allowing an attacker to use "../" sequences (URL-encoded as "%2e%2e%2f") to navigate outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server. The provided example demonstrates accessing the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP request to the Rumpus server. The malicious path is embedded within the URL.
*   The attacker must be a valid user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Rumpus server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Rumpus server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The gist provides an example of a crafted URL to exploit the path traversal:
    `http://hostname/%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd`
    *   `%252e%252e%252f` is the URL-encoded form of `../` which allows the attacker to navigate up the directory tree.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to exist in Rumpus version 8.2.11 on macOS.
