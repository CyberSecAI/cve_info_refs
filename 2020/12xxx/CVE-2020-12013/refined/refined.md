The provided content relates to CVE-2020-12013.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper control of code generation, specifically within a custom client function that interfaces with the MC Works64 GridWorX server or the ICONICS GENESIS64 FrameWorX server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a code injection issue (CWE-94). It stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or validation when processing messages from a custom client, which allows for the injection and execution of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands remotely, leading to the disclosure of internal data or allowing internal data tampering. The impact is rated as high for confidentiality and integrity, and low for availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending specially crafted messages from a custom client function that interfaces with the affected server component (GridWorX server for Mitsubishi, FrameWorX server for ICONICS). This requires network access to the vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted messages to the GridWorX (Mitsubishi) or FrameWorX (ICONICS) server from a custom client. This implies the attacker needs network access to the server and the ability to craft specific client messages that trigger the vulnerability.
