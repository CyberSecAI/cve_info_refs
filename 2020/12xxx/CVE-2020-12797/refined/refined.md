Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12797:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2020-12797 in the changelog of Consul version 1.7.4 and 1.6.6. It is also explicitly mentioned in the summary of the GitHub pull request #8047 which is associated with the vulnerability. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause lies in the improper handling of legacy ACL tokens during replication between Consul datacenters.
-  When using the legacy APIs to create or update legacy ACLs, an internal conversion process does not compute a necessary field. Due to this, when replicating legacy token updates, changes to a legacy ACL tokens rules will not be propagated to a secondary datacenter.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inconsistent ACL Enforcement:** Legacy ACL token rule changes are not correctly propagated to secondary datacenters. This leads to inconsistent permissions across the Consul cluster.
-  **Missing Calculation of Necessary Field:** An internal conversion process during legacy API usage fails to compute a necessary field needed for replication.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** An attacker with control over a secondary datacenter could potentially bypass intended restrictions set in the primary datacenter by exploiting the lack of rule updates propagation.
- **Inconsistent Security Posture:** Inconsistencies in ACL enforcement could lead to unexpected access or denial of access, depending on the datacenter an agent communicates with.
- **Compromised Security:**  A malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to resources in a secondary datacenter due to inconsistent enforcement.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulation of Legacy ACLs:** An attacker could modify a legacy ACL token's rules in the primary datacenter, knowing that these changes will not be enforced in secondary datacenters.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over Primary Datacenter:** The attacker would need the ability to create or modify ACL tokens within the primary Consul datacenter.
- **Access to Secondary Datacenter:** The attacker needs to be able to access and make requests from a secondary datacenter where the updated rules are not enforced.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content gives more specific technical details compared to the official CVE description, including the fact that it affects the propagation of legacy ACL rule changes.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that the necessary field is computed during the internal conversion of legacy ACL tokens and their rules, so the update can be properly replicated.
- The content suggests mitigations which include disabling token replication in secondary DCs, or deleting and recreating tokens in the primary datacenter instead of updating them.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Consul versions 1.7.4 and 1.6.6.
