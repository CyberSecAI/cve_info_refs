- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The certificate used to identify Orchestrator to EdgeConnect devices is not validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper certificate validation (CWE-295).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can establish a TLS connection from an EdgeConnect device to an untrusted Orchestrator, potentially allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception, or unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by establishing a TLS connection from an EdgeConnect device to a malicious Orchestrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to impersonate a legitimate Orchestrator to an EdgeConnect device.
