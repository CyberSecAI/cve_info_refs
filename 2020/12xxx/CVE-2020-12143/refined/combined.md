Security Advisory 2020-04-24-01-002: The certificate used to identify Orchestrator to
EdgeConnect devices is not validated

CVE ID:   CVE-2020-12143

 Vulnerability Type:   CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation

Details
The certificate used to identify Orchestrator to EdgeConnect devices is not validated, which makes it
possible for someone to establish a TLS connection from EdgeConnect to an untrusted Orchestrator.

Resolution

•  Changes have been made to strengthen the initial exchange between EdgeConnect appliances
and the Orchestrator. After the changes, EdgeConnect will validate the certificate used to
identify the Orchestrator to EdgeConnect.

•  TLS itself is continually subject to newly discovered and exploitable vulnerabilities. As such, all
versions of EdgeConnect software implement additional out-of-band and user-controlled
authentication mechanisms.

Recommended Actions for Silver Peak Customers

•  Do not change Orchestrator’s IP address as discovered by EdgeConnect appliances.
•  Upgrade to Silver Peak Unity ECOS™ 8.3.0.4+ or 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity

•

Orchestrator™ 8.9.2+.
In Orchestrator, enable the “Verify Orchestrator Certificate” option under Advanced
Security Settings and ensure that Orchestrator is not using a self-signed certificate.
