Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `goback_url` parameter was handled in `cfieldsExport.php` and `cfieldsImport.php`. Initially, the `goback_url` was accepted as a user-provided request parameter, which could lead to an open redirect vulnerability. The fix is removing the possibility of user provided `goback_url` and instead, the `goback_url` is hardcoded with a fixed value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The original code allowed a user-controlled `goback_url` parameter, making it possible to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The code was not properly validating or sanitizing the `goback_url` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL with a malicious `goback_url` to redirect users to a phishing page, potentially compromising user credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to a site hosting malicious software, leading to malware infections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker could craft a link with a manipulated `goback_url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the vulnerable script `cfieldsExport.php` or `cfieldsImport.php`, with a malicious `goback_url` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to click on the crafted malicious link.

**Code Changes:**

The commit diffs show that the fix involves removing the `goback_url` parameter from the list of expected parameters in `init_args()` function in both `cfieldsExport.php` and `cfieldsImport.php`. Instead of using a user-supplied value, the `goback_url` is now hardcoded to a fixed internal page, `lib/cfields/cfieldsView.php`.

```php
// OLD code:
$iParams = array("doAction" => array(tlInputParameter::STRING_N,0,50),
"export_filename" => array(tlInputParameter::STRING_N,0,100),
"goback_url" => array(tlInputParameter::STRING_N,0,2048));

// NEW code:
$iParams = array("doAction" => array(tlInputParameter::STRING_N,0,50),
"export_filename" => array(tlInputParameter::STRING_N,0,100));
```

and

```php
// OLD Code
$args->goback_url = isset($_REQUEST['goback_url']) ? $_REQUEST['goback_url'] : null;

// NEW Code
$args->goback_url = $_SESSION['basehref'] . 'lib/cfields/cfieldsView.php';
```
This change prevents the user from controlling the redirection target.
