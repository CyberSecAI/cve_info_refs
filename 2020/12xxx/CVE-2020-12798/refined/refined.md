Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of insufficient operating system policies on the Cellebrite UFED device and the ability to leverage permitted functionality to circumvent those policies. Specifically, the device attempts to restrict access to operating system features like file browsers and command prompts, but these restrictions can be bypassed through the wireless network connection dialog.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The core issue is that the Cellebrite UFED device does not adequately restrict access to privileged operating system functions. The intended limitations can be bypassed, allowing users to escalate privileges.
*   **Input Validation Error (CWE-20):**  The vulnerability leverages the "Wireless Network connection string" and specifically the certificate authentication process to expose file dialogs which should not be accessible under normal circumstances, indicating an input validation issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain an unprivileged command prompt through the bypass method. From there, they can use publicly available exploits to escalate to SYSTEM level privileges.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By combining the privilege escalation with a pre-uploaded payload, the attacker can gain full remote control over the Cellebrite UFED device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires physical access to the Cellebrite UFED device.
*   **Wireless Network Connection Dialog:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the wireless network connection options to access certificate properties and subsequently the file explorer.
*   **USB drive:** The attacker needs to pre-load an executable payload onto a USB drive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the Cellebrite UFED device.
*   **Basic Understanding of Windows OS:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of navigating Windows dialogs and file systems.
*  **Ability to create a reverse shell payload:** The attacker needs the ability to generate an executable payload file using `msfvenom` (or similar).
*  **Ability to setup a listener to receive the shell:** The attacker needs the ability to set up a listener using `msfconsole` (or similar) to receive the reverse shell connection from the payload executed on the UFED device.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to affect Cellebrite UFED versions 5.0 to 7.5.0.845.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matt Bergin (@thatguylevel) of KoreLogic, Inc.
*   The vendor (Cellebrite) claims the vulnerability is not present on devices manufactured since at least 2018, but they could not pinpoint the exact version where the issue was resolved.
