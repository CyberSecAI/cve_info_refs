Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12668:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `securitylab.github.com` explicitly mentions `GHSL-2020-072: Arbitrary file disclosure in JinJava - CVE-2020-12668`. Therefore, the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the ability to gain unauthorized access to `Class` instances within Jinjava templates and then use these instances to access the `ClassLoader` and consequently, arbitrary resources or files.

Specifically:
    *   Jinjava's restrictions on direct access to `Class` objects can be bypassed by accessing methods that return `Class[]` or `Map<?, Class>`.
    *   The internal Jinjava interpreter is exposed via the  `____int3rpr3t3r____` variable, providing access to context, functions, and tags.
    *   `Method` instances obtained via the interpreter provide access to parameter types which can be `Class` instances.
    *   `Class` instances can be used to access a `ClassLoader` instance, allowing access to classpath resources.
    *   `Class` or `ClassLoader` instances can be used to obtain file URLs, allowing access to arbitrary files in the filesystem.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Incomplete Restriction of Class Access:** Jinjava only blocked direct access to `Class` objects but missed indirect access through methods returning `Class[]` or `Map<?, Class>`.
    *   **Exposure of Internal Interpreter:** The `____int3rpr3t3r____` variable exposed internals of Jinjava, allowing access to context, functions, and tags.
    *   **Unrestricted Resource Access:** Ability to access classpath resources and arbitrary file system locations.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: The vulnerability can be leveraged to initiate Server-Side Request Forgery attacks by accessing resources using different protocols such as `http`, `https` or `ftp`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker could read the contents of arbitrary files on the server's file system.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing the internal Jinjava interpreter reveals configuration details and potentially sensitive information.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery:** Attackers could use the server to make requests to other internal services or external resources.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through crafted JinJava templates.
    *   Attackers would need the ability to create or modify JinJava templates, for instance, in a CMS environment.
    *   The injection of malicious code into templates allows access to the internals of the Jinjava engine and then the ability to access the file system.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs privileges to write and execute JinJava templates (e.g., within a CMS).
    *   No other specific attacker capabilities or positioning are mentioned.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in JinJava version 2.5.4, as seen in the changelog from `github.com_435327b2_20250119_115127.html`, which indicates that the fix for this issue was done in the pull request "Add interpreter to blacklist" ([https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/pull/435](https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/pull/435)).
*   The fix involved adding `JinjavaInterpreter` to a blacklist of restricted classes, as shown in `github.com_e16ff1ca_20250119_115125.html`.
*  The pull request `https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/pull/426` "add method to blacklist" from `github.com_fd2762ad_20250119_115123.html` indicates further attempts to restrict access.
*   The advisory was reported by  `@pwntester (Alvaro Mu√±oz)` as seen in `securitylab.github.com_3044db40_20250119_115128.html`, which also provides a detailed summary of the vulnerability and its exploitation methods.
