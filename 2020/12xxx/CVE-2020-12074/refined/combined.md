## Description

Top-rated plugin to import and export WordPress users and WooCommerce customers using CSV. Migrate to your new site without any data loss.

### Top-Rated WordPress User Import Export Plugin

The most-rated **WordPress User Import Export** plugin ever! This plugin lets you easily import and export WordPress users and WooCommerce customers from your website. You can easily migrate your users and customers from one store to another without losing data. Perfect for smooth, error-free site migrations every time.

You can import or export user/customer data using CSV files. This helps effortlessly migrate or update user data on your website. No more manually adding each user or customer one by one. Just migrate or update everything in one go!

### Key Features of WordPress User Import Export Plugin

🔸 Import or export **user/customer data** based on **user roles**, **user email**, and **date range** of when the users were added to the system.

🔸 **Batch Export/Import** for easier processing of data

🔸 **Retain existing users’ passwords** while migrating to a new website

✅ Tested OK with WordPress 6.7.1

### How Does It Work?

This WordPress user import export plugin uses CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files as input. You must create a CSV file and enter the user details in a structured format. (refer to this  [sample CSV)](https://www.webtoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Users_SampleCSV.csv) This is to match each field of the user import CSV file to the appropriate user fields in WordPress.

For example, the user\_email field gets mapped to the User Email. Otherwise, the admin needs to manually map the import user CSV fields.

> Note – For the plugin to work correctly, you must map the headers of all the columns correctly and ensure that all of the fields you enter are in the correct format.

You can create the CSV from scratch or export the user CSV using the same plugin. Use any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Google Spreadsheets, to create and edit your CSV file.  [Save this file in UTF-8 encoding with extension .csv.](https://www.webtoffee.com/how-to-save-csv-excel-file-as-utf-8-encoded/)

After entering all details about users in a spreadsheet, you can bulk import users to WordPress. With this plugin, you can also export and download user details as a CSV file.

For a step-by-step guide on setting up the plugin, check out our documentation: [WordPress Users & WooCommerce Customers Import Export Plugin – User Guide.](https://www.webtoffee.com/user-import-export-plugin-wordpress-user-guide/)

# Vulnerability Patched in Import Export WordPress Users

On February 26th, our Threat Intelligence team discovered a vulnerability in [Import Export WordPress Users](https://wordpress.org/plugins/users-customers-import-export-for-wp-woocommerce/), a WordPress plugin installed on over 30,000 sites. The flaw allowed anybody with subscriber-level access or above to import new users via a CSV file, including administrative-level users.

We reached out to the plugin’s developer on February 26th, who responded that they were currently working on updating their plugin with several security fixes. They released a patch for the problem before we provided the full disclosure of the vulnerability to them. After the initial release, we provided some additional security recommendations for issues not addressed in that initial release. The plugin’s developer released a patch addressing those concerns shortly thereafter.

This is considered a high severity security issue that could allow attackers to completely take over WordPress sites. We highly recommend updating to the latest version, 1.3.9, immediately.

Wordfence Premium customers received a new firewall rule on February 26th to protect against exploits targeting this vulnerability. Free Wordfence users will receive the rule after thirty days, on March 27th.

**Description:** Arbitrary User Creation

**Affected Plugin:** [Import Export WordPress Users](https://wordpress.org/plugins/users-customers-import-export-for-wp-woocommerce/)

**Plugin Slug:** users-customers-import-export-for-wp-woocommerce

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.3.8

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-12074](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12074)

**CVSS Score:** 8.8 (High)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 1.3.9

Import Export WordPress Users is used to easily import and export WooCommerce and WordPress users. In order to provide this functionality, the plugin registers an AJAX action, `wp_ajax_user_csv_import_request`, which leads to the execution of a four-step upload and import function, `dispatch()`, using a separate case for each step.

```
class WF_CustomerImpExpCsv_AJAX_Handler {

   /**
    * Constructor
    */
   public function __construct() {
      add_action( 'wp_ajax_user_csv_import_request', array( $this, 'csv_customer_import_request' ) );
   }

   /**
    * Ajax event for importing a CSV
    */
   public function csv_customer_import_request() {
      define( 'WP_LOAD_IMPORTERS', true );
                WF_CustomerImpExpCsv_Importer::customer_importer();
   }

}
new WF_CustomerImpExpCsv_AJAX_Handler();
```

Steps one and two of the four-step process already had nonces and capability checks, however, there were no nonce checks at steps three and four. There, the permissions check only verified that a user had the `manage_woocommerce` capability if WooCommerce was enabled.

```
case 3 :
    // Check access - cannot use nonce here as it will expire after multiple requests
    if (function_exists('WC')) {
        if (!current_user_can('manage_woocommerce'))
            die();
```

Typically, a capability check for `manage_woocommerce` would be sufficient in cases where a plugin requires that WooCommerce is installed in order to be activated. However, this plugin’s functionality was designed to be used with both WooCommerce-powered WordPress installations and standard WordPress installations. A site running this plugin without WooCommerce installed had no capability check, allowing any user logged in with subscriber-level capabilities and above the ability to execute steps three and four and ultimately import new users.

This vulnerability allowed attackers to import new users with administrative capabilities and gain complete control over the site. They could then revoke the original site owner’s access, inject malicious Javascript that might redirect site visitors to a malicious site, inject malware and backdoors to retain access to the site, or even escalate control to other sites in the hosting account, and much more. Once an attacker obtains administrator level access to a site, they can pivot and escalate their malicious activity in endless ways. As such, it is incredibly important to update to the latest version of this plugin immediately.

Freshly Imported WordPress Users.

## Unrestricted File Location Usage During User Import

In steps one and two of the import process, administrators are prompted to upload a CSV file that will be used later in step three to provide user data for the import. The first two steps were both protected by WordPress nonces as well as WordPress’s inherent capability controls that only allow administrators and editors to use the `upload_files` function. This meant that although subscribers could technically import users in step three of the process, they could not upload files to be used as part of the import process.

However, these restrictions didn’t matter, as step three did allow remote files to be used during the import process, which allowed attackers the ability to bypass the capability checks in steps one and two of the process. An attacker could simply include a remotely hosted file for the file parameter. This file would then be used to supply a list of users to be added during the import.

![](https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-11-at-4.20.02-PM.png)

Example CSV file used during user import.

Fortunately, in the latest version, the developer implemented security precautions to restrict files that can be used during import. The plugin now only accepts CSV files that have been previously imported to the site. Therefore, remotely hosted files can no longer be used as part of the user import process.

## Other WebToffee WooCommerce Plugins Affected

Several additional WooCommerce-centric import/export plugins from WebToffee used the same import functionality. However, they were unable to be activated unless WooCommerce was installed, ensuring that the `manage_woocommerce` capability check was sufficient in restricting low-level users from completing imports. Despite that, there were no nonce checks on these imports, meaning that the source of requests were not verified. If an administrator of a site was tricked into executing an unwanted action, products could be injected, along with comments, orders and more, potentially containing malicious payloads.

The following plugins were affected, and we recommend updating to the latest versions in parentheses as soon as possible:

* [Order Export & Order Import for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/order-import-export-for-woocommerce) (1.6.1)
* [Product Import Export for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-import-export-for-woo/) (1.7.5)
* [Order XML File Export Import for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/order-xml-file-export-import-for-woocommerce/) (1.3.1)
* [Product Reviews Import Export for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-reviews-import-export-for-woocommerce) (1.3.3)
* [XML File Export Import for Stamps.com and WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/xml-file-export-import-for-stampscom-and-woocommerce/) (1.1.9)
* [WordPress Comments Import & Export](https://wordpress.org/plugins/comments-import-export-woocommerce) (2.1.11)
