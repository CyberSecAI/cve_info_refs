{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2020-12074",
    "Root cause": "The plugin lacked sufficient access control checks during the user import process, specifically in steps 3 and 4 of the import function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing nonce checks in steps 3 and 4 of user import.",
      "Insufficient capability checks: Only checked for 'manage_woocommerce' capability when WooCommerce was active, and no capability check was performed when it wasn't.",
      "Unrestricted file location usage: Allowed import from remote files, bypassing file upload capability checks.",
      "Missing nonce checks in other related import/export plugins"

    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers could import new users with administrative privileges, leading to complete site takeover. They could also inject malicious code and compromise site data, redirect users to malicious websites or cause other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP request to the `wp_ajax_user_csv_import_request` AJAX action, using the plugin's import functionality.  The attacker can provide the required data via CSV file hosted remotely.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site and the ability to craft HTTP requests. The attacker also needs access to a remote server to host the malicious CSV file."
