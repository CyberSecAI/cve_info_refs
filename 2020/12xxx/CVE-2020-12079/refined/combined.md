⚠️ **Hey everybody! This is an important security fix. Please update immediately if you are using Beaker 0.8.x.** ⚠️ Follow [#1519](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/1519) for more information. We will post a full post-mortem there after users have had time to update.

* ⚠️ Critical security fix ([#1519](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/1519))

> **Note** Some users have reported that the settings page will not open, making it difficult to update. If this is the case for you, download the binary from this page and reinstall.

A very big thank you to [@imagemlt](https://github.com/imagemlt) for researching this issue and responsibly disclosing it.

---

A major new release of Beaker is now in closed beta and will be releasing soon this year! It has also had this security fix applied. Stay tuned for updates at <https://twitter.com/beakerbrowser>
