Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the `exemplaryStatusId` parameter within the `/index.php?module=gnuteca3&action=main:search:simpleSearch` endpoint.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`exemplaryStatusId`) before using it in a SQL query, leading to a SQL Injection vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modification or deletion of data.
    *   Potential compromise of the application and underlying system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to `/index.php?module=gnuteca3&action=main:search:simpleSearch`, by manipulating the `exemplaryStatusId` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
