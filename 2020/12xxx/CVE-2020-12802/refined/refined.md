    "description": "LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only documents from locations deemed 'trusted' are allowed to retrieve remote resources. This mode is not the default mode, but can be enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources within a document. A flaw existed where remote graphic links loaded from docx documents were omitted from this protection prior to version 6.4.4.",

  "CVE-2020-12803": {
    "description": "ODF documents can contain forms to be filled out by the user. Similar to HTML forms, the contained form data can be submitted to a URI, for example, to an external web server. To create submittable forms, ODF implements the XForms W3C standard, which allows data to be submitted without the need for macros or other active scripting. LibreOffice allowed forms to be submitted to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling form submissions to overwrite local files. User-interaction is required to submit the form, but to avoid the possibility of malicious documents engineered to maximize the possibility of inadvertent user submission this feature has now been limited to http[s] URIs, removing the possibility to overwrite local files.",
