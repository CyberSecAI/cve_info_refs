{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A POST request with an invalid tagging XML can crash the RGW process by triggering a null pointer exception.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "NULL pointer exception"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause Ceph to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a POST request to Ceph RGW with a malformed XML payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Ceph RGW service."
