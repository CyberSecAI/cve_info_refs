# phpList 3.5.3 released: Enable Matomo Analytics for your campaigns

[ARCHIVE](/newslist)
 2020/04/22    [Leave a comment](https://www.phplist.org/newslist/phplist-3-5-3-release-notes/#respond)

phpList 3.5.3 is now available for download, including Matomo Analytics Integration, PHPMailer update and  5 other changes.

## Changes in this release

Matomo Integration is now available as an alternative to Google Analytics. You can choose between Matomo or Google Analytics in the Settings page of your account.  Similarly to the current GA parameters, when selected, each URL will have four additional query parameters that will be displayed and can be edited on the Finish tab when composing a campaign. The data is not collected, stored or viewed in phpList.

Special thanks to our community member [Duncan Cameron](http://www.dcameron.me.uk/phplist) for implementing this feature. You can see more details about the changes on [the pull request](https://github.com/phpList/phplist3/pull/643).

#### Usability improvements and functionality enhancements

* A configuration setting can now be used to allow customising the format of a displayed DATE — see [the pull request](https://github.com/phpList/phplist3/pull/639). Check how it is used via the “[Help](https://github.com/phpList/phplist-lan-help/pull/22/)” option.
* Consistent formatting of ‘date’ and ‘datetime’ fields used on Send, Admin and Plugins pages — thanks to [@duncanc](https://www.phplist.org/members/duncanc/), see [the pull request](https://github.com/phpList/phplist3/pull/640).

#### Fixes

* [Security Fix]: Implement an XSS filter in /lists/admin/template.php file to avoid privilege elevation — thanks to [Dien Pham](https://github.com/dienuet) from Vietnam Security Network (VSEC) for reporting the issue and testing the fix.
* Removed unnecessary function calls for page category and subcategory, avoiding repeated calls of some functions and reducing loading time for the homepage – thanks to [@duncanc](https://discuss.phplist.org/u/duncanc) , see [the pull request](https://github.com/phpList/phplist-ui-bootlist/pull/116)
* Further changes to the bootstrap select to address the sometimes missing “Language menu”– see [mantis issue](https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=0019988)
* Correct the link to the PHPMailer documentation in config\_extented.php — thanks to @adgitate1

#### Other

PHPMailer upgraded to version 6.1.5  from PHPMailer 6.1.1 — thanks to [@duncanc](https://www.phplist.org/members/duncanc/), see [the pull request](https://github.com/phpList/phplist3/pull/641)
