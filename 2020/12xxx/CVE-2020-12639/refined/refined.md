The provided content includes information related to CVE-2020-12639.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper filtering of Javascript code within the /lists/admin/template.php file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege elevation. An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code into templates, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of other users, including administrators, which can lead to privilege elevation or takeover of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code into the template.php file through an input field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify template settings or introduce malicious code through a template editor accessible through the admin panel. They would likely need at least some level of authenticated access to the application in order to be able to make changes to templates.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented involves adding an XSS filter to the `/lists/admin/template.php` file. The report and fix were provided by Dien Pham from Vietnam Security Network (VSEC).
