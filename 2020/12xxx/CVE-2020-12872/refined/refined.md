Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12872:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2020-12872 in the issue tracker of the `erlyaws/yaws` GitHub repository. The issue links to a Medium article that details the vulnerability.  The medium article content aligns with the description of the Sweet32 attack, which is a known vulnerability related to weak 64-bit block ciphers.  Therefore the content is relevant to CVE-2020-12872.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of weak 64-bit block ciphers (specifically DES and 3DES) in the Yaws web server's TLS/SSL implementation. These ciphers are susceptible to the Sweet32 attack, which is a type of birthday attack.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Use of Weak Ciphers:** The primary weakness is the support for and use of DES and 3DES ciphers, which have a small block size (64-bit) making them vulnerable to block collision attacks
    *   **Lack of Session Rekeying:**  The server allows for long-lived connections using these vulnerable ciphers which is required for a practical Sweet32 attack.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can recover sensitive information, such as HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, and potentially passwords.
    *   **Traffic Interception:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can intercept and decrypt the traffic between the client and the server.
    *   **Account Takeover:** In scenarios where the session cookie is stolen by the attacker, they can use it to impersonate the victim, gaining unauthorized access to their account and data.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) Attack:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser. This JavaScript code forces the browser to repeatedly send HTTP requests to the targeted server using a vulnerable cipher.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker intercepts the traffic between the client and server, collecting the data for analysis and exploitation, though the provided attack used javascript in the browser.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Monitoring:** The attacker needs to be able to monitor and record the encrypted traffic between the client and the server.
    *   **JavaScript Injection/Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript in the user's browser to generate a large amount of traffic.
    *   **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs sufficient computational power to process and analyze captured traffic, particularly for sorting and identifying block collisions. The article mentions the use of the stxxl library for sorting the captured data, highlighting the need for handling large datasets.

**3. Additional Technical Details (From Medium Article and sweet32.info):**

*   **Sweet32 Attack Explanation:** The Sweet32 attack exploits the birthday paradox, which states that in a set of randomly chosen elements, there's a higher probability of collisions than one might expect. In this case, when the same key is used to encrypt more than 2^32 blocks with a 64-bit block cipher, collisions in the ciphertext are likely to occur. When combined with predictable parts of the encrypted data (like HTTP headers or cookies), these collisions allow for the decryption of the secret part (e.g. the cookie or auth token).
*   **Data Requirements:** The Medium article states that the attack becomes practical after capturing around 785 GB of traffic, which could take hours to capture.
*   **Practical Exploitation:** The attacker can use a web worker or similar methods to send large amounts of HTTP traffic within the same session to the server.
*   **Targeted protocols**: The article specifically discusses the vulnerability in the context of HTTP over TLS and OpenVPN. It also mentions that other protocols like SSH and IPsec may be vulnerable.

**4. Mitigation:**

*   **Disable Weak Ciphers:** The primary recommendation is to disable the use of DES and 3DES ciphers.
*   **Prefer Strong Ciphers:** Configure the webserver to prefer stronger 128-bit ciphers like AES.
*   **Implement Session Rekeying:** Force session rekeying after a certain amount of data has been sent or after a certain time.
*   **Client-Side Mitigation:** Browsers can mitigate the attack by implementing data limits per connection and by treating 3DES only as a fallback cipher.

**5. Code Snippets**

The medium article includes Javascript code examples which illustrate how a malicious client would force the browser to send large amounts of traffic to a vulnerable server.

**In summary**, CVE-2020-12872, as detailed by the content, highlights the danger of using weak 64-bit block ciphers like DES and 3DES. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via a birthday attack (Sweet32) to intercept traffic and steal sensitive data from web server using vulnerable ciphers. The main fix is to disable or reduce the use of the vulnerable ciphers and/or configure frequent session rekeying.
