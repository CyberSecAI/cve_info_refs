The provided content relates to CVE-2020-12642.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper configuration of the XML parser within the Report Portal service-api, specifically regarding external entity resolution during JUnit XML launch import.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The service-api was vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks due to the XML parser not being configured to prevent external entity resolution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by importing a specially crafted XML file that leverages external entities. This could lead to:
   - Extraction of secrets from the Report Portal service-api module.
   - Server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, and the vulnerability is triggered through the import of a malicious XML file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to import XML files into the Report Portal service-api. This likely involves being an authenticated user with the necessary permissions to initiate a launch import.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the service-api starting from 3.1.0.
- The issue was fixed in Report Portal versions 4.3.12+ and 5.1.1+, which disable external entity resolution for their XML parser.
- The vulnerability was reported by an external security researcher.
