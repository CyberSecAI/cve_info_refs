Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2020-12255:

**Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution via File Upload

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file upload validation in rConfig version 3.9.4. Specifically, the `vendor.crud.php` script checks the `Content-Type` of uploaded files but fails to validate the file extension or header, allowing an attacker to bypass restrictions by manipulating the `Content-Type`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate File Type Validation:** The application relies solely on the `Content-Type` header for file validation, ignoring the file extension and actual file content.
- **Lack of Extension Whitelisting:** The application does not enforce a whitelist of allowed file extensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file containing arbitrary code (e.g., a web shell). By accessing the uploaded PHP file, the attacker can execute code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Functionality:** The vulnerability is exploited through the file upload feature available under the 'Add Vendor' option in the `vendors.php` page.
- **Content-Type Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `Content-Type` of the uploaded file to `image/gif` to bypass the server-side validation.
- **Direct File Access:** After uploading the malicious PHP file, the attacker accesses the file directly via a URL like `https://ip-rconfig/images/vendor/shell.php?cmd=whoami` to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs to be able to access the rConfig application and have the ability to navigate to the file upload page (`vendors.php`).
- **Ability to Intercept HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a tool like Burp Suite, to change the `Content-Type` of the uploaded file.
- **Knowledge of the Upload Path:** The attacker needs to know where the uploaded files are stored on the server (e.g., `images/vendor/`) to access and execute the uploaded PHP file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit details the steps for uploading a shell.php file by changing the `Content-Type` to `image/gif`, bypassing the server validation.
- The exploit also references a method to reset the admin user's password if the attacker does not have administrative credentials. This is done by utilizing the exploit at <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48878>
