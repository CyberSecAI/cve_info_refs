### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)

A vulnerability has been discovered in the fdtCONTAINER component issued by M&M Software and used by other products, including RTIS and PACTware. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability on the workstation by supplying/providing a manipulated project file. If that manipulated project file is loaded, malicious code could be executed without notice.

[CVE-2020-12525](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12525) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Transportation Systems
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Emerson reported this vulnerability to CISA and M&M Software.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

M&M Software recommends users choose one of the following solutions:

* Update the fdtCONTAINER component/fdtCONTAINER application to a version that provides a more secure deserialization of the project data. This version will still use a deprecated serialization technology but will fix the currently known attack vector and will be compatible with existing, non-manipulated project files.
* Update the fdtCONTAINER component/fdtCONTAINER application to a version (fdtCONTAINER component: 3.7 or newer, fdtCONTAINER application: 4.7 or newer) that provides a secure deserialization of the project data with an updated serialization technology. This will break the compatibility to existing, non-manipulated project files.

The [CERT@VDE advisory for M&M Software](https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2020-048) also recommends the following mitigation practices:

* Exchange project data only via secure exchange services.
* Use appropriate means to protect the project storage from unauthorized manipulation.
* Do not open project data from an unknown source.
* Reduce the user rights of the host application to the necessary minimum.

Emerson has published a notification ([EMR.RMT20004.Rev3](https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/emr-rmt20004-rev3-en-7259618.pdf)) for this vulnerability in RTIS. RTIS users should review this notification for additional information specific to RTIS.

CERT@VDE has published an advisory ([VDE-2021-001](https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2021-001)) for this vulnerability in PEPPERL+FUCHS PACTware.

CERT@VDE has published an advisory ([VDE-2021-002](https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2021-002)) for this vulnerability in Weidmüller FDT/DTM Software with WI Manager.

Mitsubishi Electric has published advisory [2020-020](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-020_en.pdf) concerning the vulnerability in MELSOFT FieldDeviceConfigurator.

CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Ensure the least-privilege user principle is followed.
* Do not open project files from untrusted sources.
* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

#### Impact

Pepperl+Fuchs analyzed and identified affected devices.
Remote attackers may exploit multiple vulnerabilities to get access to the device and
execute any program and tap information.

#### Solution

In order to prevent the exploitation of the reported vulnerabilities, we recommend that the
affected units be updated with the following three firmware packages:

* U-Boot bootloader version 1.36 or newer
* System image version 1.52 or newer
* Application base version 1.6.11 or newer

Furthermore, it is always recommended to observe the following measures if the affected
products are connected to public networks:

1. An external protective measure to be put in place.
   Traffic from untrusted networks to the device should be blocked by a firewall.
   Especially traffic targeting the administration webpage.
2. Device user accounts to be enabled with secure passwords.
   If non-trusted people/applications have access to the network that the device is connected to, then configuring passwords for all three User Accounts is recommend.

#### Reported by

T.Weber (SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab) reported this vulnerability.

CERT@VDE coordinated and provided the CVE IDs.
