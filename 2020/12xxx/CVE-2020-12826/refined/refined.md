Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the Linux kernel's signal subsystem related to permission checks during process exit. Specifically, a parent process can specify an arbitrary signal for a child process to send upon exit, but if the parent has executed a new program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. This check can be bypassed by integer overflow of parent's self_exec_id.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `self_exec_id` and `parent_exec_id` fields of the `task_struct`. These 32-bit unsigned integers are incremented on each `execve()` call, and can wrap around.
- **Insufficient Permission Checks:**  The check in `do_notify_parent()` function which is designed to prevent arbitrary signals being sent from child to parent does not properly handle integer overflows. 
- **Race condition:** Although not directly related to the overflow itself, the signal subsystem's permission checks are vulnerable to a race condition between the parent and child.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Signal Delivery:** A local attacker can bypass the kernel's signal permission checks and send arbitrary signals to a privileged (e.g., setuid-root) parent process after the parent process has executed a new program.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation or Denial of Service:**  The specific impact depends on how the setuid programs handle arbitrary signals, with a potential impact ranging from denial of service due to arbitrary application crash, to privilege escalation through a vulnerability in a signal handler.
- **Coredump Generation:** A core dump can be generated in a high privileged context if the signal is SIGSEGV which is typically blocked in production configurations by setting /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable to 0 or 2.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Process Execution:** The attacker requires the ability to execute programs, including those with setuid permissions.
- **Timing:** The exploit involves repeatedly executing a program to cause an integer overflow to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account on the target system.
- Ability to execute programs.
- The attacker needs to run a program for an extended period (potentially days) to cause the integer overflow.
- Knowledge of potentially vulnerable setuid programs.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The `self_exec_id` and `parent_exec_id` fields are part of the `task_struct`, which is the core structure for managing processes in the Linux kernel.
- The vulnerability is located in the `do_notify_parent()` function, called from `exit_notify()` when a process exits. This function checks if the child can send a non-SIGCHLD signal to its parent based on security domain.
- The check involves comparing the child's `parent_exec_id` with the parent's `self_exec_id`.
- The `setup_new_exec()` function increments the `self_exec_id` field upon an execve() call.
- The vulnerability can bypass a fix introduced in Linux Kernel 3.3.5 that overwrites exit signal to always be SIGCHLD when a new program is executed, by overflowing the parent's `self_exec_id` counter to match a child's parent_exec_id value, before the new program is executed.
