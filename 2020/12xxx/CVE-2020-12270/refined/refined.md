{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Bluezone app generates user IDs using a predictable seed for its random number generator, based on the device's timestamp. The app broadcasts this fixed ID via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Predictable User IDs: The 6-character IDs are generated using a seed based on the timestamp, making them predictable.",
    "Fixed Bluetooth ID: The app broadcasts the same generated ID repeatedly.",
    "Insufficient ID Length: The IDs are only 6 characters long, which leads to a high probability of collisions with a large user base.",
    "External Storage Backup: The app backs up the database of observed IDs, MAC addresses and device names to external storage, making it accessible to other apps.",
	"Use of seedrandom library: The use of the seedrandom library seeded with the current timestamp makes the generated IDs predictable"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can track users, their movements, and their social graphs by monitoring Bluetooth broadcasts of the fixed IDs. Attackers can pre-register all possible IDs, potentially denying service to future users. An attacker can also generate all possible IDs and broadcast them everywhere, or target specific groups of users based on their installation time.  Data stored in the external storage can be accessed by other apps, and can be falsified by users to alter exposure records.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Passive tracking via BLE monitoring",
	"Denial of service by pre-registering IDs.",
    "Targeted tracking of specific user groups.",
	"Data exfiltration and falsification via external storage access"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range to intercept broadcasts and may also require an understanding of the ID generation algorithm to predict future IDs, also must have access to the external storage on the device to view backups."
