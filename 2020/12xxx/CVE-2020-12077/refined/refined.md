{
  "CVE-2020-12077": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin registered AJAX actions that called functions without capability checks and nonce checks.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization in map title and body parameters.",
         "Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to insecure file upload, deletion, and disclosure functionalities.",
         "Lack of capability checks and nonce checks in AJAX actions."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a map, redirecting site visitors to malicious sites or using an administrator's session to take over the site. The RCE vulnerability could lead to complete site takeover, allowing attackers to modify files, upload additional files, connect to the database, and insert administrative users.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted $_POST requests to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with specific action parameters.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated user with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, is required to exploit these vulnerabilities."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure handling of map data and template files.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data",
        "Unrestricted file upload and deletion",
        "File disclosure vulnerability via direct access."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary code on the server, complete site takeover, site reset, and potential exposure of sensitive database credentials.",
       "Attack vectors": "Malicious requests to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` to save, delete, or retrieve map templates.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires an authenticated user."
