## Description

MapPress is the easiest way to add unlimited, beautiful interactive Google and Leaflet maps to WordPress.

Create **unlimited maps and markers** using Gutenberg blocks or the classic editor. The popup map editor makes creating and editing maps easy!

Upgrade to [MapPress Pro](https://mappresspro.com/mappress) for even more features, including custom icons (with a built-in icon editor!), search and filter, clustering, and much more. See it in action on the [MapPress Home Page](https://mappresspro.com/mappress) or test it yourself with a [Free Demo Site](https://mappresspro.com/demo)!

I am currently using Mappress for a client project, and it was the best solution I could find to meet all of my client’s needs. Most importantly, the support from the Mappress team has been stellar and has saved me many hours of frustration.

## Description

MapPress is the easiest way to add unlimited, beautiful interactive Google and Leaflet maps to WordPress.

Create **unlimited maps and markers** using Gutenberg blocks or the classic editor. The popup map editor makes creating and editing maps easy!

Upgrade to [MapPress Pro](https://mappresspro.com/mappress) for even more features, including custom icons (with a built-in icon editor!), search and filter, clustering, and much more. See it in action on the [MapPress Home Page](https://mappresspro.com/mappress) or test it yourself with a [Free Demo Site](https://mappresspro.com/demo)!

### Upgrade

1. Deactivate your old MapPress version
2. Delete your old MapPress version (don’t worry, the maps are saved in the database)
3. Follow the installation instructions to install the new version

I am currently using Mappress for a client project, and it was the best solution I could find to meet all of my client’s needs. Most importantly, the support from the Mappress team has been stellar and has saved me many hours of frustration.

# Critical Vulnerabilities Patched in MapPress Maps Plugin

On April 1, 2020, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence Team discovered two vulnerabilities in [MapPress Maps for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress), a WordPress plugin with over 80,000 installations. One vulnerability that allowed stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was present in both the free and pro versions of the plugin, while a far more critical vulnerability that allowed Remote Code Execution (RCE) was present in the pro version.

We reached out to the plugin’s author the next day, April 2, 2020 and received a response within a few hours. A patched version of both MapPress Free and MapPress Pro were released within hours. We strongly recommend updating both the free and pro versions to the latest version, 2.54.2, as soon as possible.

Wordfence Premium users received a new firewall rule on April 2, 2020 to protect against exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Wordfence users still using the free version will receive the rule after thirty days on May 2, 2020.

**Description**: Authenticated Map Creation/Deletion Leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Plugin**: [MapPress Maps for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress)

**Plugin Slug**: mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress

**Affected Versions**: <=2.53.8 Free and Pro

**CVE ID**: CVE-2020-12077

**CVSS Score**: 6.5(Medium)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Fully Patched Version**: 2.53.9

MapPress Maps for WordPress allows site owners to add custom maps on their site, using both the Google Maps API and the open-source Leaflet engine. Both the free and pro versions of this plugin registered AJAX actions that called functions lacking capability checks and nonce checks. The affected AJAX hooks:

```
add_action('wp_ajax_mapp_delete', array(__CLASS__, 'ajax_delete'));
```
```
add_action('wp_ajax_mapp_save', array(__CLASS__, 'ajax_save'));
```

As such, it was possible for a logged-in attacker with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to add a map containing malicious JavaScript to an arbitrary post or page by sending a `$_POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `mapp_save`, the `postid` parameter set to the post to add the map to, and the `map` parameter containing JSON data representing the map to be added. Malicious JavaScript could be added to the `title` and `body` parameters of a “Point of Interest” in the saved map, which would be executed whenever a visitor to the site clicked on the mapping pin denoting that Point of Interest (POI). Alternatively, if the global setting for “Show a list of POIs with each map” was enabled, the JavaScript would be executed immediately upon visiting a page with an impacted map.

This vulnerability could redirect a site visitor to a malicious site, or even use an administrator’s session to take over the site by adding a malicious administrative user.

The vulnerable function:

```
   static function ajax_save() {
       ob_start();

       $mapdata = (isset($_POST['map'])) ? json_decode(stripslashes($_POST['map']), true) : null;
       $postid = (isset($_POST['postid'])) ? $_POST['postid'] : null;

       if (!$mapdata)
           Mappress::ajax_response('Internal error, your data has not been saved!');

       $map = new Mappress_Map($mapdata);
       $mapid = $map->save($postid);

       if ($mapid === false)
           Mappress::ajax_response('Internal error, your data has not been saved!');

       do_action('mappress_map_save', $mapid);     // Use for your own developments

       // Return saved mapid
       Mappress::ajax_response('OK', array('mapid' => $mapid));
   }
```

Alternatively, an attacker could delete an existing map by sending a `$_POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `mapp_delete` and the `mapid` parameter of the map to delete. While this would be significantly less impactful, it could still be used by an attacker to remove any of the original maps on the site, potentially prompting an administrator to investigate and trigger a script inserted into a malicious map.

The vulnerable function:

```
   static function ajax_delete() {
       ob_start();

       $mapid = (isset($_POST['mapid'])) ? $_POST['mapid'] : null;
       $result = Mappress_Map::delete($mapid);

       if (!$result)
           Mappress::ajax_response("Internal error when deleting map ID '$mapid'!");

       do_action('mappress_map_delete', $mapid);   // Use for your own developments
       Mappress::ajax_response('OK', array('mapid' => $mapid));
   }
```

**Description**: Authenticated File Upload, Deletion, and Disclosure Leading to RCE or Site Reset

**Affected Plugin**: [MapPress Maps for WordPress](http://mappresspro.com/)

**Plugin Slug**: mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress

**Affected Versions**: <=2.53.8 Pro

**CVE ID**: CVE-2020-12077

**CVSS Score**: 9.9(Critical)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version**: 2.53.9

The pro version of the MapPress plugin offers the ability to create templates controlling how maps are displayed. It saves these templates as custom .php files. Unfortunately, the plugin registered several AJAX actions that called functions without capability checks or nonce checks:

```
add_action('wp_ajax_mapp_tpl_get', array(__CLASS__, 'ajax_get'));
add_action('wp_ajax_mapp_tpl_save', array(__CLASS__, 'ajax_save'));
add_action('wp_ajax_mapp_tpl_delete', array(__CLASS__, 'ajax_delete'));
```

Note that while the names of some of these functions are identical to functions in the previous vulnerability, they are located in another file and belong to a different class. The file containing this vulnerable code was present in both the free and pro versions of the MapPress plugin, but was only active in the pro version.

As such, it was possible for an authenticated attacker with minimal permissions to upload an executable PHP file such as a backdoor or webshell. This could easily lead to complete site takeover, as an attacker with backdoor access could then modify any file on the site, upload additional files, or connect to the database and insert an administrative user.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a `$_POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `mapp_tpl_save`, the `name` parameter set to the base name of the file they wanted to create, and the `content` parameter set to executable PHP code. This file would then be created and could be executed from the directory of the currently active theme, resulting in Remote Code Execution.

The vulnerable function:

```
   static function ajax_save() {
       $name = (isset($_POST['name'])) ? $_POST['name'] : null;
       $content = (isset($_POST['content'])) ? stripslashes($_POST['content']) : null;
       $filepath = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/' . $name . '.php';

       $result = @file_put_contents($filepath, $content);
       if ($result === false)
           Mappress::ajax_response('Unable to save');

       // Return filepath after save
       Mappress::ajax_response('OK', $filepath);
   }
```

An authenticated attacker could also delete any existing PHP file on the site by sending a `$_POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `mapp_tpl_delete`, and the `name` parameter set to the basename of the file to delete.

For example, to delete `wp-config.php` a directory traversal attack could be used, with the `name` parameter set to `../../../wp-config`. This would cause the site to be reset, at which point an attacker could gain control of the site by setting it up from scratch and connecting it to a remotely hosted malicious database.

The vulnerable function:

```
   static function ajax_delete() {
       $name = (isset($_POST['name'])) ? $_POST['name'] : null;
       $filepath = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/' . $name . '.php';

       $result = @unlink($filepath);
       if ($result === false)
           Mappress::ajax_response('Unable to delete');

       Mappress::ajax_response('OK');
   }
```

Finally, an authenticated attacker could view the contents of any existing PHP file on the site by sending a `$_GET` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `mapp_tpl_get`, and the `name` parameter of the file to disclose. For example, to view the contents of `wp-config.php`, an attacker could set the `name` parameter to `../../../../wp-config`. This could allow an attacker to determine the site’s database credentials. If the site’s database allowed remote access, the attacker could then use this to add an administrative user or make any other desired changes to the database, up to and including deleting nearly all of the site’s content.

The vulnerable function:

```
   static function ajax_get() {
       $name = (isset($_GET['name'])) ? $_GET['name'] : null;

       $filename = $name . '.php';
       $filepath = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/' . $filename;

       $html = @file_get_contents($filepath);
       $standard = @file_get_contents(Mappress::$basedir . "/templates/$filename");

       if (!$standard)
           Mappress::ajax_response('Invalid template');

       $template = new Mappress_Template(array(
           'name' => $name,
           'content' => ($html) ? $html : $standard,
           'path' => $filepath,
           'standard' => $standard,
           'exists' => ($html) ? true : false
       ));

       Mappress::ajax_response('OK', $template);
   }
```
