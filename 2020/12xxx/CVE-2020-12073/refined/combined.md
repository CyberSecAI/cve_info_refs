The Starter Templates feature gives you access to a library of 250+ professionally designed website templates built using the Elementor page builder and WordPress block editor. To use a template, you simply import it, edit the content, and launch your website.

The Responsive Plus plugin extends the popular [Cyberchimps Responsive theme](https://cyberchimps.com/responsive-theme/). It adds the following features:

* One click demo import of ready-to-use Elementor & block templates.
* Option to import the entire website or selected pages, which allows you to mix and match while building website.

#### What are ready-to-use website starter templates?

The Responsive theme comes with **250+ ready-to-use [website starter templates](https://cyberchimps.com/wordpress-themes/)**.

All you have to do is import a template, edit content, and launch.

#### Key Features

**Elementor Template Library:**

Responsive Plus plugin offers 250+ ready-made templates.

You can import complete sites as well as single pages like:

* Home Page
* About Page
* Service Page
* Contact page and any other available page.

Responsive Plus plugin also has 500+ built-in sections that you can download for free. Deliver exceptional WordPress websites with niche-specific sections, impress clients, and boost your business.

**White Label Feature:**

White-label features help you replace the Cyberchimps Responsive Theme branding with your brand.

You can replace the original developer’s name, logo, and other branding elements with your or your client’s company. This feature allows you to create a personalized look and feel for the theme, making it your own product.

**Mega Menu:**

Transform your website with a visually appealing mega menu that adapts seamlessly to all devices. Your visitors will be able to easily navigate your website by showing a variety of categories and subcategories.

The mega menu feature works with the Cyberchimps Responsive Theme. Please ensure the theme is activated to see the mega menu settings on your WordPress website.

**Custom Fonts:**

Using the Custom Fonts feature, you can upload personalized fonts to match your website’s typography requirements. These fonts can be purchased or downloaded from free font resource websites because they are usually not available in the free Google Fonts Library.

Responsive Theme offers deep integration with the WooCommerce plugin to customize every aspect of your product pages. You can unlock additional WooCommerce features using the WooCommerce module to create your product page layout, typography, colors, live previews, and images!

I quite like the Responsive Theme, albeit it’s beginning to feel a little ‘old hat’ now, but I can’t give it full marks all the time the annoying ‘nag’ inviting me to review it appears on my Dashboard, and won’t allow me to close it. Highly infuriating

The Responsive WordPress theme is awesome! It’s perfect for anyone who wants a sleek and modern design that works great on all devices. You can customize it however you want, even if you’re not a tech expert. And it loads super fast, which is great for keeping visitors on your site. Overall, I’d highly recommend this theme to anyone looking to create a beautiful and functional website.

# Severe Flaws Patched in Responsive Ready Sites Importer Plugin

On March 2nd, our Threat Intelligence team discovered several vulnerable endpoints in [Responsive Ready Sites Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-add-ons/), a WordPress plugin installed on over 40,000 sites. These flaws allowed any authenticated user, regardless of privilege level, the ability to execute various AJAX actions that could reset site data, inject malicious JavaScript in pages, modify theme customizer data, import .xml and .json files, and activate plugins, among many other actions.

We reached out to the plugin’s developer on March 3, 2020, and they were proactive and quick to respond. They released patches consisting of nonce and permissions checks on nearly all of the AJAX endpoints before we sent over the full vulnerability details the following morning. We still provided the full disclosure, and pointed out a few AJAX endpoints missed in their initial release. They released a final patch just a few days later.

This is considered a severe security issue that could lead to attackers completely taking over WordPress sites. We highly recommend updating to the latest version available, 2.2.7, immediately.

Wordfence Premium customers received a new firewall rule on March 2, 2020, to protect against exploits targeting this vulnerability. Free Wordfence users will receive the rule after thirty days, on April 1, 2020.

**Description**: Unprotected AJAX Actions

**Affected Plugin:** [Responsive Ready Sites Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-add-ons/)

**Plugin Slug:** responsive-add-ons

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.2.5

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-12073](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12073)

**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.2.6

Gutenberg & Elementor Templates Importer For Responsive, also called Responsive Ready Sites Importer, is a plugin designed to import templates and site content to be used with the Gutenberg or Elementor page builders. The plugin is very simple to use and provides a plethora of templates for site owners to choose from.

The import functionality relies on various AJAX actions, with functionalities ranging from resetting site data prior to an import all the way to importing .xml and .json files to provide data for the import. We discovered 23 vulnerable endpoints, and the majority of these were found in the /class-responsive-ready-sites-importer.php file.

```

/**
 * Constructor.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
public function __construct() {

   add_action( 'init', array( $this, 'load_importer' ) );

   $responsive_ready_sites_importers_dir = plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ );
   require_once $responsive_ready_sites_importers_dir . 'class-responsive-ready-sites-importer-log.php';
   include_once $responsive_ready_sites_importers_dir . 'class-responsive-ready-sites-widgets-importer.php';
   include_once $responsive_ready_sites_importers_dir . 'class-responsive-ready-sites-options-importer.php';

   // Import AJAX.
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-set-site-data-free', array( $this, 'import_start' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-xml', array( $this, 'import_xml_data' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-wpforms', array( $this, 'import_wpforms' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-customizer-settings', array( $this, 'import_customizer_settings' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-widgets', array( $this, 'import_widgets' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-options', array( $this, 'import_options' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-end', array( $this, 'import_end' ) );

   add_action( 'responsive_ready_sites_import_complete', array( $this, 'clear_cache' ) );

   include_once $responsive_ready_sites_importers_dir . 'batch-processing/class-responsive-ready-sites-batch-processing.php';

   // Reset Customizer Data.
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-reset-customizer-data', array( $this, 'reset_customizer_data' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-reset-site-options', array( $this, 'reset_site_options' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-reset-widgets-data', array( $this, 'reset_widgets_data' ) );

   // Reset Post & Terms.
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-delete-posts', array( $this, 'delete_imported_posts' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-delete-wp-forms', array( $this, 'delete_imported_wp_forms' ) );
   add_action( 'wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-delete-terms', array( $this, 'delete_imported_terms' ) );

   if ( version_compare( get_bloginfo( 'version' ), '5.0.0', '>=' ) ) {
      add_filter( 'http_request_timeout', array( $this, 'set_timeout_for_images' ), 10, 2 );
   }
}
```

Using the `import_start` function tied to the `wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-set-site-data-free` action as an example below. It can be shown that there was a lack of capability checks and nonce checks as part of the functions. This was evident in all of the identified functions triggered by the registered AJAX actions that we found vulnerable.

```

/**
 * Start Site Import
 *
 * @since  1.0.0
 * @return void
 */
public function import_start() {

          $demo_api_uri = isset( $_POST['api_url'] ) ? esc_url( $_POST['api_url'] ) : ''; //phpcs:ignore

   if ( ! empty( $demo_api_uri ) ) {

      $demo_data = self::get_responsive_single_demo( $demo_api_uri );
      if ( ! $demo_data['success'] ) {
         wp_send_json( $demo_data );
      }

      update_option( 'responsive_ready_sites_import_data', $demo_data );

      if ( is_wp_error( $demo_data ) ) {
         wp_send_json_error( $demo_data->get_error_message() );
      } else {
         do_action( 'responsive_ready_sites_import_start', $demo_data, $demo_api_uri );
      }

      wp_send_json_success( $demo_data );

   } else {
      wp_send_json_error( __( 'Request site API URL is empty. Try again!', 'responsive-addons' ) );
   }

}
```

All of the vulnerable actions could be called with a simple request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=[Vulnerable-Action]` along with the appropriate parameters set, by any authenticated user, including users with minimal subscriber-level permissions.

Fortunately, in the latest version of this plugin, capability checks to help control access and execution, as well as CSRF protection using WordPress nonces, were implemented on all of these endpoints.

## A Deeper Dive on a Few Endpoints

Although there were several unprotected endpoints, a few were a little more worrisome than others.

The AJAX action `wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-xml` triggers a function that imports an XML file to be used to supply data as part of the import process. Then, the AJAX action `wp_ajax_responsive-wxr-import` would trigger the function that imports all the data from the previously imported XML file. Using these two actions together could allow an attacker to import an XML file containing malicious payloads such as new pages on the site. The malicious payloads would then be executed anytime a user browsed to the newly imported page. This could result in malicious site redirects and rogue administrative user creation, among other consequences.

The AJAX actions `wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-options`, `wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-widgets`, and `wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-customizer-settings` triggered functions that would import widgets, site options, and site customizer data. These could be used by an attacker to overwrite site data with malicious data of their choice.

## A Brief Note To Site Owners and WordPress Developers

*Site owners.* Vulnerable AJAX endpoints are, unfortunately, a very common vulnerability among WordPress plugins and themes. We highly recommend disabling user registration on your site if it is not necessary for the site’s functionality. If your site is running a plugin or theme with a vulnerable AJAX endpoint, this will prohibit any attackers from being able to register an account, login, and then execute attacks against these vulnerable endpoints that could potentially compromise your site.

It is also highly recommended to ensure your plugins and themes are up to date at all times as these vulnerabilities are often immediately discovered and patched. In the cases where a patch isn’t released quickly, it is important you have a Web Application Firewall in place, such as the one provided by Wordfence, to help provide protection during the interim period where a vulnerability might be discovered and actively attacked before it has been completely patched.

*Developers.* It is incredibly important to add capability checks and CSRF protection on functions controlled by AJAX actions in plugins and themes. Subscriber-level users and above have the ability to execute these actions if the proper security measures are not in place. Many WordPress sites allow open registration, creating a large attack surface for these vulnerabilities that are typically very easy to exploit.

Use functions like [`current_user_can()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/current_user_can/) to check for user capability on actions along with [`wp_create_nonce()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_create_nonce/) and [`wp_verify_nonce()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_verify_nonce/) to verify the legitimacy of a request’s source to protect against CSRF on all AJAX functions.

To see how common these vulnerabilities are, you can review some of our recently discovered unprotected AJAX actions vulnerabilities in [Popup Builder](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/03/vulnerabilities-patched-in-popup-builder-plugin-affecting-over-100000-sites/), [Import Export WordPress Users](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/03/vulnerability-patched-in-import-export-wordpress-users/), [301 Redirects – Easy Redirect Manager](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/12/critical-vulnerability-patched-in-301-redirects-easy-redirect-manager/), and [RegistrationMagic](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/03/multiple-vulnerabilities-patched-in-registrationmagic-plugin/). As a plugin developer, it is important to take preventive steps against creating these vulnerabilities, just as it is important to protect yourself against these as a site owner.
