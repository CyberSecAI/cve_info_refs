Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper access controls and security checks on multiple AJAX endpoints within the "Responsive Ready Sites Importer" WordPress plugin. Specifically, there was a lack of capability checks and nonce verification in the functions associated with these AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unprotected AJAX Actions:** The plugin registered several AJAX actions that could be triggered by any authenticated user (including subscribers) without proper authorization checks or nonce verification.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Vulnerability:** Due to the lack of nonce verification, an attacker could potentially craft malicious requests and trick an authenticated user into executing them.
- **Insecure Data Import:** The plugin allowed importing of arbitrary XML and JSON files, as well as options, widgets and customizer settings without validation or sanitization, which could be used to inject malicious code or overwrite existing data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
- **Full Site Takeover:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript, modify theme customizer data, activate plugins, and import malicious XML/JSON files, potentially leading to complete control of the WordPress site.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could reset site data, import malicious data, overwrite existing site options, widgets, and customizer settings with malicious payloads.
- **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers could inject malicious redirects into website pages, leading users to phishing sites or other malicious content.
- **Rogue Admin User Creation:** Attackers could potentially create new administrative users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability via HTTP requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
- **Method:** By crafting a request to vulnerable AJAX endpoints (`wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-set-site-data-free`, `wp_ajax_responsive-ready-sites-import-xml`, and others) with the appropriate parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needed to be a logged in user on the target WordPress site. Even a subscriber-level account would suffice.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker would need to know the names of the vulnerable AJAX actions.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable plugin was called "Responsive Ready Sites Importer" (also known as "Gutenberg & Elementor Templates Importer For Responsive").
- The vulnerability was present in versions <= 2.2.5.
- A fix was released in version 2.2.6, adding nonce and permission checks.
- The vulnerability had a CVSS score of 9.1 (Critical).
