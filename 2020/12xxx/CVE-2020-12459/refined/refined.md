Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12459:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The bugzilla.redhat.com content explicitly mentions `(CVE-2020-12459) grafana: information disclosure through world-readable grafana configuration files`. This aligns directly with the official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER), confirming relevance.
*   The security.netapp.com content contains an advisory (NTAP-20200518-0004) specifically about `CVE-2020-12459 Grafana Vulnerability in NetApp Products`, further confirming its relevance.
*   The lists.fedoraproject.org entry explicitly mentions the fix for CVE-2020-12459 in the `grafana-6.7.3-1.fc31` update.
*   The src.fedoraproject.org content shows a commit message referencing the fix for CVE-2020-12459
*  The github.com entry describes a similar issue but in a different file (`grafana.db`). It is not directly related to CVE-2020-12459.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that the default file permissions for Grafana configuration files (`/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` and `/etc/grafana/ldap.toml`) were set to be world-readable (0644) instead of the more restrictive 0640 in versions 6.x through 6.4.3 of Grafana distributed by Red Hat.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness was the incorrect setting of file permissions, which allowed any local user to read the configuration files.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The configuration files contained sensitive information such as `secret_key` and `bind_password`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker could gain access to sensitive information, such as the Grafana `secret_key` and LDAP `bind_password`. This information could potentially be used for further attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker must have a user account on the system where Grafana is installed.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system.
*   **Ability to Read Files:** The attacker needs to have the ability to read files on the system. This capability is provided by the misconfigured file permissions, as they are world-readable.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Grafana versions 6.x through 6.4.3, as distributed by Red Hat, were affected. Grafana versions 5.x had correct file permissions. Red Hat ServiceMesh package includes Grafana v6.4.3, which also has the incorrect file permission. OCP 3.11 ships with Grafana 5.4.3 which is also affected.
*  **Mitigation:** The identified mitigation is to manually change the permission of the configuration files to `640` using `chmod 640 /etc/grafana/grafana.ini /etc/grafana/ldap.toml`.
*   **Fix:** The fix involved changing file permissions to 640 and updating the Grafana package. The commits that implemented the fix are located at `<https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/grafana/c/fab93d67363eb0a9678d9faf160cc88237f26277>`.
*   **NetApp's assessment:** NetApp stated that none of its products were affected by this vulnerability. This is likely due to differences in deployment and configuration from the vulnerable Red Hat distribution.
*  **Container Context:**  For OCP and OSSM, while the database files were set to world readable, SELinux MCS labels reduce the impact by preventing other processes on the host from reading these files.
*   **RHSA:** Red Hat addressed this vulnerability in RHSA-2020:2362 (Openshift Service Mesh 1.0) and RHSA-2020:4682 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8)

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

The vulnerability in Grafana configuration files (CVE-2020-12459) arose from insecure default file permissions, making sensitive information readable by local attackers. This vulnerability primarily affected Grafana versions 6.x through 6.4.3 distributed by Red Hat, as well as the version shipped with OCP 3.11 and potentially Red Hat ServiceMesh, although the impact was reduced by SELinux in container deployments. The vulnerability was addressed by changing the file permissions of `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` and `/etc/grafana/ldap.toml` to `640` . NetApp has determined that none of its products are affected by this CVE.
