Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles Content Security Policy (CSP) for documents loaded via `data:` URLs within `<object>` elements. Specifically, the CSP of the parent document was not being applied to these embedded documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **CSP Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is a Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass. The intended security mechanism to restrict the execution of scripts was ineffective for `data:` URL documents within `<object>` elements.
-   **Incorrect Policy Inheritance:** The core issue is that `data:` URL documents loaded inside `<object>` elements failed to inherit the CSP of their parent document. This is in contrast to `<iframe>` elements, where the parent's CSP is correctly inherited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unrestricted Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allowed the execution of scripts within the embedded `<object>` content that should have been blocked by the parent's CSP.
-   **Potential for Self-Contained Exploits:** An attacker could leverage this to deliver self-contained exploits by embedding malicious `data:` URLs within `<object>` elements on a website with a restrictive CSP policy.
-   **Bypassing WebExtension Protections:**  This vulnerability could bypass security mechanisms that WebExtensions rely on to block scripts through CSP. Even though the embedded document has a null origin, it could still deliver a self-contained exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious HTML:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTML page containing a `<object>` element with a `data:` URL that includes malicious JavaScript.
-   **Website Compromise:** An attacker could compromise a legitimate website and inject the malicious HTML, potentially targeting users visiting the compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Inject HTML:** An attacker would need the ability to inject HTML content into a webpage. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    -   Compromising a website directly.
    -   Using a vulnerability in a website's code that allows for HTML injection.
    -   Convincing a user to visit a webpage containing the malicious code.
-   **Basic Web Development Knowledge:** The attacker would need to be familiar with HTML and the usage of `<object>` elements and `data:` URLs.

**Additional details:**
- This issue was classified as a "moderate" severity issue.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 76 and not backported to older releases.
- The issue was initially reported in 2017 and fixed in 2020.
