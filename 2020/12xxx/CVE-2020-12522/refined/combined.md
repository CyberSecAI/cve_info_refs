#### Details

[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12522)

---

#### Impact

By exploiting the described vulnerabilities the attacker potentially is able to manipulate or disrupt the device.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

* Disable I/O-Check service
* Restrict network access to the device.
* Do not directly connect the device to the internet.

**Remediation**

The I/O-Check service protocol is only needed during installation and commissioning, not during normal operations. It is highly recommended to disable the I/O-Check service after commissioning. This is the easiest and securest way to protect your device from the listed vulnerabilities.

Regardless to the action described above, the vulnerability has been fixed in FW11, released in December 2017.

#### Reported by

This vulnerability was originally found by Florian Seidel of WAGO and was rediscovered by Uri Katz of Claroty.
