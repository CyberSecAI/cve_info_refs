Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-12620:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `setdns` command within the `pihole` command-line interface (CLI) not sanitizing input correctly. Specifically, when the `setdns` command is used to set upstream DNS servers, it sources an environment variable that contains user-provided input. This allows the attacker to inject and execute shell commands by inserting shell metacharacters into the DNS server IP address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By appending shell metacharacters like `&&` followed by a command to a DNS server IP address, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running `pihole`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** An attacker with the ability to run `pihole` as a privileged user (such as `www-data`) can achieve root shell access by injecting a command into the `setdns` command.  This is because the `setdns` command sets an environment variable which is then sourced by the shell.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploited, this allows the attacker to execute any command on the system as the root user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface (Indirectly):** Though not the primary attack vector, the vulnerability can be triggered via the web interface by crafting a malicious `/etc/pihole/dnsserver.conf` file, which is read to populate the list of upstream DNS servers. When the attacker selects the crafted IP address and saves the changes through the web interface, the injected command executes.
- **CLI (Directly):**  The vulnerability is directly exploited by running the command `sudo pihole -a setdns "1.1.1.1&&bash"` from the command line, granting a root shell if the user has permission to run `pihole` with `sudo`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Write Access to `/etc/pihole/dnsserver.conf` (for web interface vector):** For exploiting the vulnerability via the web interface, the attacker needs to be able to modify the `/etc/pihole/dnsserver.conf` file.
- **Ability to Run `pihole` with `sudo`:**  The attacker must be able to execute the `pihole` command as a privileged user (e.g., `www-data`, if allowed with sudo) to leverage the command injection vulnerability.
- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system running Pi-hole to modify files or execute commands.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in Pi-hole versions prior to 5.0.
- CVE-2020-14162 is a related vulnerability that allows for direct root shell access via the `pihole -a setdns` command by an attacker that is able to run `pihole` with sudo.
- The original method of exploitation (modifying dnsserver.conf) actually leverages both CVE-2020-12620 and CVE-2020-14162.
