Based on the provided content, CVE-2020-12006 refers to multiple vulnerabilities in Advantech WebAccess/SCADA. There are three distinct vulnerabilities, each stemming from a lack of input validation and leading to remote code execution:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the `DATACORE.exe` process when handling IOCTL `0x0000791e`.
*   **Weakness:** Directory Traversal due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution as Administrator.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No specific capabilities are required besides network access.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the `ViewSrv.dll` process when handling IOCTL `0x00002711`.
*   **Weakness:** Command Injection due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution as Administrator.
*  **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No specific capabilities are required besides network access.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the `DrawSrv.dll` process when handling IOCTL `0x00002711`.
*   **Weakness:** Command Injection due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution as Administrator.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No specific capabilities are required besides network access.

All three vulnerabilities share the same CVE ID, but they affect different components of Advantech WebAccess/SCADA and have different root causes (directory traversal vs command injection). They all allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges.
