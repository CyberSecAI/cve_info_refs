Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2020-12832.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient path sanitization in the Simple File List plugin, specifically affecting non-Linux users who enable front-side file management. The plugin did not properly validate file paths, allowing for directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The plugin failed to properly sanitize file paths, allowing attackers to potentially access files and directories outside of the intended upload directory.
- Insufficient input validation: The plugin did not properly validate user-provided file paths allowing for `../` sequences.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized file access: Attackers could potentially read or modify arbitrary files on the server.
- Possible remote code execution (RCE): depending on server configuration, an attacker could potentially upload a malicious file to an arbitrary location and execute it.

**Attack vectors:**
- File management interface: The vulnerability is exposed through the front-end file management interface when enabled by the administrator.
- File paths: Malicious user-supplied file paths containing `../` sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the front-end file management interface. This might require having a valid user account if the file management is restricted to logged-in users.
- The attacker needs the ability to manipulate file paths.
- The system has to be a non-Linux system as Linux systems are not affected by this vulnerability due to different handling of paths.
