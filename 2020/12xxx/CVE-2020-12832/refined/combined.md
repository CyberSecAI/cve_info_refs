## Description

Simple File List is a free plugin that is great for when you need to provide a list of files, either publicly available or private to logged-in users. Place a file list anywhere on your site using a simple shortcode, allowing your front-end users to open, download and optionally edit them. Users can also upload files if you choose.

Simple File List is also a good alternative for organizations using clumsy FTP or Dropbox for larger files. Simply provide your clients with a link to their file list.

### Features

* Displays a file list, file uploader or both using simple shortcode: [eeSFL]
* Manage your files and the list settings from the Admin List on the back-end.
* Choose from three file list styles: table, tiles or flex.
* Choose from a light or dark theme, or choose no theme and provide the styling of your theme.
* Complete settings for the file list style and display, file upload restrictions, and upload notifications.
* Both the front-end list and file upload form can be shown to users based on their role; Everyone, Only Logged-in User, Only Admins or Nobody (OFF).
* Collect the users name, email and description of the file(s) uploaded. This can optionally be shown in the file list.
* Files can be assigned descriptions, which can be added from the Admin list or user uploads.
* Optionally allow your front-end users full control over renaming, moving, sending, deleting and editing descriptions.
* Includes a number of custom hooks you can tie into for file and list actions:

  \*\* Uploaded, Added, Removed, Deleted, Edited, Listed, Loaded, Scanned

### This Plugin is Great For:

* Posting official documents.
* Sharing files within an organization.
* Sharing files with business clients or a community.
* Enabling distance learning by allowing schools to share class materials with students.
* When you need a list of archived files, such as videos, PDF files, or music files.
* When you need a simple front-side uploader so people can send you files.
* Exchanging files when the sizes get too large for email attachments.

### File List Features

* Limit access to only Admins or logged-in users, or hide the list and only show the uploader.
* Add and manage your files from the Admin List on the WordPress back-end.
* Show details like file dates, size and a thumbnail for PDFs, images and videos.
* Add descriptions to files and optionally show them in your list.
* Sort file by name, date modified, date added or file size … ascending or descending.
* Files are kept separate from the media library.
* Add the free Media Player extensions for an improved experience with audio and video files.

  \*\* [Simple File List Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ee-simple-file-list-media/)

### File Uploader Features

* Simple reliable uploader, works on mobile devices too.
* Drag and drop zone, plus upload progress bar

* For each list mode you can separately control permissions for file uploading and front-side file management.

**Group Mode**

Restrict file list access to a specified group of WordPress users.

## FAQ

### Q: Who is Simple File List for?

A: Anyone who exchanges files with clients, customers or within an organization.

### Q: Are the file uploaded to the Media Library?

A: No, files are uploaded to a special folder inside your general WordPress uploads folder, or anywhere you specify.

### Q: Can I limit the access to my file to only logged-in users?

Yes, you can limit to Admins or anyone who is logged in. If you need further users access control, consider the [File Access Manager](https://simplefilelist.com/file-access-manager/) extension.

### Q: Can people who upload overwrite existing files?

A: No, by default a file will not be overwritten. If a file is uploaded having the same name as one already present, a series number is appended to the name ( filename\_(2).ext ). If you don’t want this, uncheck the box on the Upload Settings tab.

### Q: Can I place different lists in different places?

A: Yes, you can put place your file lists on different posts, pages and widgets. If you upgrade to the [Pro](https://simplefilelist.com) version, you can even place different folders on your site.

### Q: Are the files in the list searchable by Google and other search engines?

A: Only if you place a list on the front-side of your website which is viewable to the general public. If you choose USER, ADMIN or NO, in the List Settings these files will not be indexed by search engines.

### Q: Can I customize the appearance of the list and uploader?

A: Yes, the CSS is easily over-ridden, making it easy for anyone with CSS knowledge to customize the page design. Check the Instructions page within the plugin’s admin panel for more info.

### Q: Can I create custom behavior after an action completes?

A: Yes, you can hook into one of the many [custom hooks](https://free.simple-file-list.com)) provided.

### Q: What is the maximum upload file size?

A: This is a setting that you choose in the file configuration. The initial default is the maximum that your host will currently allow. The absolute maximum size will depend on your hosting setup. which is automatically detected.

### Q: What if I have trouble or need assistance? Will you help?

A: Yes! I enjoy helping people. Please contact me with any issues using the [WordPress Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-file-list/) or via [simplefilelist.com](https://simplefilelist.com/get-support/)

### Q: Why did you develop this plugin?

A: I got frustrated with the difficulties of getting files back and forth between myself and my non-technical clients once they become too large for email, and having an archive for them to return to was needed. Training these people to use FTP or Dropbox was a challenge. I wanted something simple that I could use on my own website, so I created a simple index.php page that solved my problem. I later realized that others could benefit from this functionality, so I decided to port it to my favorite website platform; WordPress. I also hoped that the donations would pay for a large home and a private jet, but that has not happened yet 🙁 Regardless, I still enjoy giving to the community and helping others.

Version 5 worked well, but the uploading UI on the backend was a bit odd. Version 6 really is a nice improvement. Been using the plugin for a few years, easy to manage and a great way to organize shared and hidden files as needed right on your server.

This plugin is a lifesaver when you need a simple way to present a list of hundreds of viewable / downloadable files to the enduser as part of a document library or catalog. Or if you want bulk file uploads, organized separately from the abyss of the default media library, with consistent web addresses that don’t have Wordpress’s year-month organization. The ability to password protect the upload location and do file overwriting is a major plus. There are so many other useful settings and features that I could go on and on. For the price, the Pro option and extensions were a no-brainer for me. Kudos to the developer of this plugin!

Just what I’ve been looking for, a very simple way for users to upload/download files. Very easy to use and the developer responds quickly for support.

I needed to add a directory for users to exchange files and SFL does the job quite well. Some of the other plugins I looked at try to do too many other things. SFL does the task just as needed. I had some plugin conflicts going on and Mitch was quite helpful.
The pro version and extensions are well worth it.

I bought Simple File List Pro and was very happy with the product. Definitely a good purchase.
As my site is a few years old, I had some issues with it. I emailed Mitch and he was very responsive to my needs and helped resolve the issues I had.
As for the product itself, it has a very nice, clean interface. It is easy to set up and the documentation is thorough.
My only regret is that I didn’t hear about this plugin sooner.
I highly recommend this product.
