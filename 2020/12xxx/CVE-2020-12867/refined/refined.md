{
  "CVE-2020-12867": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference in sanei_epson_net_read in SANE Backends before 1.0.30 allows a malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim to cause a denial of service, aka GHSL-2020-075.",
    "root_cause": "The `sanei_epson_net_read` function in `epson2_net.c` has a bug where, if it receives a response with an unexpected size, and `size != wanted`, it proceeds to use `s->netbuf` without checking if it is initialized. In the case of the PoC the `s->netbuf` has not been initialized and is NULL leading to a null pointer dereference when trying to read `s->netbuf`",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote denial of service, where “remote” means a device or computer connected to the same network as the victim. For example, in a typical office environment the malicious device would need to be somewhere inside the building. Because the vulnerability causes `simple-scan` to crash as soon as it starts, it makes the application unusable.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted response to a SANE client that is scanning for network scanners. The attacker must have a device/computer on the same network as the victim."
