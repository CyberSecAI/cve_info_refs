Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-12899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an "Arbitrary Read" issue within the AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10. The specific location in the code is not described other than it is a call to an "escape" interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arbitrary Read vulnerability: The driver allows reading from arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- KASLR bypass: By reading kernel memory, an attacker can obtain kernel addresses to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization.
- Denial of service: The arbitrary read can lead to a crash or other instability, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located within the AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10 and is triggered through an "escape" call interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the AMD Graphics Driver in Windows 10 using an escape call interface. It is implied that a low privilege user can trigger the vulnerability.
