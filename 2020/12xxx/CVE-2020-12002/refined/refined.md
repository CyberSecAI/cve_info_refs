Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-12002:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This occurs in multiple components of Advantech WebAccess/SCADA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system, with the privileges of the Administrator. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- Potential for information disclosure and compromise system availability as noted by US-CERT advisory, however, the specific CVE-2020-12002 is only mentioned for Remote Code Execution via Stack-based Buffer Overflow in the advisories.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, network-based attacks. The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely and authentication is not required.
- The specific attack vector is through sending user-supplied data to the vulnerable components of the Advantech WebAccess/SCADA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable system.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Low skill level is required to exploit based on US-CERT advisory.

**Specific Vulnerable Components:**
The identified advisories from ZDI specify the following vulnerable components:
  - BwBacNetJ device driver
  - DATACORE.exe (specifically IOCTL 0x00005241 and 0x00005227)
  - OPCUA device driver
  - GpsET200 device driver
  - SyntecUA device driver

**Additional details**
- The US-CERT advisory mentions that this CVE is related to stack-based buffer overflow
- The US-CERT advisory confirms that a fix is available for affected versions of WebAccess Node 
- Multiple different components are vulnerable to the same kind of vulnerability.
