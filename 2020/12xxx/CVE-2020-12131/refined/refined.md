The provided content is related to CVE-2020-12131.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the AirDisk Pro iOS application, specifically when handling user-supplied data for folder creation, file deletion prompts, and device name display. This allows for the injection of malicious script code, leading to persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application fails to sanitize user inputs in the `createFolder`, `deleteFile`, and `devicename` parameters.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or encode user input before displaying it in the UI. This allows malicious script code injected through these parameters to be executed in the context of the application's web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal user session cookies.
- **Persistent Phishing Attacks:**  Malicious scripts could be used to display fake login forms and harvest user credentials.
- **Persistent External Redirects:**  Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Persistent Manipulation of Application Modules:** The application's functionality could be altered by the injected scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **createFolder parameter:** Malicious script code injected through the `createFolder` parameter is executed when the folder listing is displayed.
- **deleteFile parameter:** Script code injected into the `deleteFile` parameter is executed within the delete confirmation popup.
- **devicename parameter:** Malicious script code injected via the device name is executed when the file sharing UI is accessed.
- **FTP service:** Vulnerabilities can be exploited through the unauthenticated FTP service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access (e.g., via Wi-Fi) to the device running the vulnerable AirDisk Pro application.
- **Low User Interaction:**  Minimal user interaction is required for the attacks to be successful. For example, just browsing the folders or triggering the delete popup is enough to execute the injected script.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploitation is possible even without authentication, especially via the FTP service, indicating the vulnerability is exploitable by anonymous users on the same network as the target device.
