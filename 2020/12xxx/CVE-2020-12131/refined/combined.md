Easy to create file like: Text File, New folder, Playlist, Take Photo/Video, Import From Library, and Voice Record.
AirDisk Pro allows you to store, view and manage files on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. You can connect to AirDisk
Pro from any Mac or PC over the Wi-Fi network and transfer files by drag & drop files straight from the Finder or Windows
Explorer. AirDisk Pro features document viewer, PDF reader, music player, image viewer, voice recorder, text editor, file

Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the official SuperBackup v2.0.5 ios mobile application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise the mobile
web-application from the application-side.
The first vulnerability is located in the `createFolder` parameter of the `Create Folder` function. Attackers are able to name
or rename paths via airdisk pro ui to malicious persistent script codes. Thus allows to execute the persistent injected script
code on the front site of the path index listing in the content itself on each refresh. The request method to inject is POST
and the attack vector is located on the application-side. Interaction to exploit is as well possible through the unauthenticated
started ftp service on the local network.
The second vulnerability is located in the `deleteFile` parameter of the `Delete` function. The output location with the popup
that asks for permission to delete, allows to execute the script code. The injection point is the file parameter and the execution
point occurs in the visible delete popup with the permission question. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector
is located on the application-side.
The third web vulnerability is located in the `devicename` parameter that is displayed on the top next to the airdisk pro ui logo.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious persistent script code by manipulation of the local apple devicename information.
The injection point is the devicename information and the execution point occurs in the file sharing ui panel of the airdisk pro
mobile web-application.
Remote attackers are able to inject own script codes to the client-side requested vulnerable web-application parameters. The attack
vector of the vulnerability is persistent and the request method to inject/execute is POST. The vulnerabilities are classic client-side
cross site scripting vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing
attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] AirDisk pro Wifi UI
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] createFolder
[+] deleteFile
[+] devicename
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with wifi access with low user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Disallow special chars in the folder and filenames. Sanitize all inputs and filter all involved parameters to prevent application-side attacks.
2. Parse the output location of the popup permission message content to prevent further executions after injects via post method.
3. Sanitize the devicename displayed on top of the wifi user interaction by a secure parsing mechanism.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerabilities in the application functions are estimated as medium.
