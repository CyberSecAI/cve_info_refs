Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12778:

**Root Cause:**

- The restore backup script in iTop does not properly escape the token value when it's called with an invalid token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Because the script displays the invalid token without escaping it, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the token value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through crafted URL with an invalid token.
- An attacker could lure a victim into clicking a malicious URL containing a crafted, invalid token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with an invalid token.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing the malicious URL, thus executing the XSS.
