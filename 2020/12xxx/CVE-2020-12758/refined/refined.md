   - The content from `github.com_622ab879_20250119_134452.html` which is the pull request `CVE-2020-13170: Local ACL Token Used in Remote Datacenters #8068` has been edited to show that it is related to "CVE-2020-13170: Local ACL Token Used in Remote Datacenters", while the content from `github.com_d158d640_20250119_134453.html` describes the vulnerability, and references `CVE-2020-12758` and contains the fix.

   Therefore, the content is relevant to `CVE-2020-12758`.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A service-router configuration entry without a defined destination, when created by a user with `service:write` permissions, causes a crash in Consul servers. This indicates an unhandled case within the service-router config validation or processing logic.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - Lack of proper validation in the service-router config entry. Specifically, the absence of a destination field was not correctly handled, leading to a crash.
     - Inadequate error handling during processing of service-router config entries.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing Consul servers to crash. This disruption impacts the availability of services that depend on Consul for service discovery and configuration.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - The attack vector is through the creation of a malformed service-router config entry. This can be done through the Consul API or CLI by a user with `service:write` permissions.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - An attacker needs to have a valid ACL token with the `service:write` permission within the Consul cluster. This would usually be a user or service with elevated privileges to register and modify services.

**3. Additional Details:**

   - The provided fix involves constructing a default destination if none exists.
   - The vulnerability was introduced in Consul v1.6.0 and fixed in v1.7.4 and v1.6.6.

   - The vulnerability can be triggered by creating the specific config entry, not by normal usage.

In summary, the vulnerability in `CVE-2020-12758` stems from improper handling of service-router entries lacking a destination field, leading to a crash. Attackers with `service:write` permissions can exploit this through the API. This issue was resolved in Consul versions 1.7.4 and 1.6.6, which included a fix to construct a default destination, and a check preventing the crash.
