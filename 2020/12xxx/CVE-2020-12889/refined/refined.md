{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MISP connection was being shared by all users when used as a remote transform, which could lead to unauthorized access or information disclosure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper sharing of a MISP connection, leading to potential unauthorized access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized access to MISP data or actions performed by other users, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Utilizing the MISP-maltego transform as a remote transform where the connection is shared between multiple users.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a user of the MISP-maltego transform when it is configured to run in remote mode. The attacker needs to share the system with other users."
