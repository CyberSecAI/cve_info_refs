Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12783:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the SPA (Simple Password Authentication) authentication mechanism in Exim. Specifically, the code lacked proper validation of user-supplied data related to NTLM authentication messages, which are encoded structures containing length and offset fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to manipulate the offset and length parameters of the NTLM response, leading to an out-of-bounds read in memory.
- **Integer Overflow:** Initial attempts to fix the vulnerability were prone to integer overflows on 32-bit systems, potentially leading to crashes. This was later corrected.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By controlling the offset, an attacker could bypass authentication checks by adjusting the offset to point to the `ntRespData` structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the SPA/NTLM authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the mail server.
- **Data Confidentiality:** The vulnerability could expose sensitive information to an attacker by accessing arbitrary memory regions.
- **System Crash:** On 32-bit systems, the vulnerability could cause a crash if exploited using integer overflows.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via network access to the mail server utilizing the NTLM authentication mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to connect to an Exim server via network and perform NTLM authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious NTLM authentication message.
- The SPA authentication mechanism must be enabled on the Exim server, though this is not the default configuration.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is present in `src/auths/spa.c`. The vulnerable code is related to parsing and validating the response from an NTLM authentication request. Specifically, the code that handles the offset and length fields within the NTLM response:
```c
    int len = SVAL(&responseptr->uUser.len,0)/2;
    if (  (off = IVAL(&responseptr->uUser.offset,0)) >= sizeof(SPAAuthResponse)
        || len >= sizeof(responseptr->buffer)/2
        || (p = (CS responseptr) + off) + len*2 >= CS (responseptr+1)
        )
    {
        DEBUG(D_auth)
        debug_printf("auth_spa_server(): bad uUser spec in response\n");
        return FAIL;
    }
```
and:
```c
    off = IVAL(&responseptr->ntResponse.offset,0);
    if (off >= sizeof(SPAAuthResponse) - 24)
    {
    DEBUG(D_auth)
        debug_printf("auth_spa_server(): bad ntRespData spec in response\n");
        return FAIL;
    }
```
The original code lacks proper bounds checking for user-supplied values, allowing for out-of-bounds reads. The fix ensures that the offset and length values remain within the bounds of the data structures being accessed.
The vulnerability affects the SPA authenticator which is not enabled by default.

**Additional Notes:**
The content from `www.openwall.com` does not directly pertain to CVE-2020-12783, but is a general advisory on multiple Exim vulnerabilities. It does not provide new details on this vulnerability.
Multiple sources mention the fix for this vulnerability in Exim 4.94, although other sources (like ubuntu security notice) have provided fixes to older versions like exim 4.93.
The vulnerability was discovered by Orange Tsai from DEVCORE security team.
The fix for this vulnerability has been backported to different Debian and Ubuntu versions.
