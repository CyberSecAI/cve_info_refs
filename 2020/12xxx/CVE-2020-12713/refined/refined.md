Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-12713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **MTA Configuration File Manipulation:** The CipherMail software allowed an administrator to directly edit the Postfix main configuration file (`main.cf`) through the web interface. This file supports various settings, some of which can lead to code execution.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The software did not sufficiently validate changes made to the Postfix configuration, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** By inserting specific commands into the Postfix configuration file, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An administrator with access only to the web interface could, through the code injection, gain root access to the entire system.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The lack of proper validation on the settings entered through the web interface was a significant weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation granted attackers full root access to the server.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially access or modify sensitive data stored on the system.
*   **System Control:** Complete control of the system, allowing for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** Attackers would leverage the web-based administration interface of CipherMail to modify the Postfix configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** Attackers needed to have administrative-level access to the CipherMail web interface.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in CipherMail Gateway and Webmail Messenger.
*   The fix involved implementing an `allowed_settings` variable that contains a list of safe settings. Changes to settings not on this list are blocked.
*   The advisory also mentions a related vulnerability (CVE-2020-12714) regarding backup and restore functionality, but only CVE-2020-12713 is addressed in this analysis.
*   The original advisory was provided by Core Security.
