Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-12447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Onkyo TX-NR585 receiver's web interface has a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The web interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
- **Weak Input Validation/Filtering:** The implemented filter to prevent directory traversal is weak and can be easily bypassed using URL encoding techniques such as `%2e%2e%2f`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive File Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, like `/etc/shadow`, which contains password hashes.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** With access to password hashes and potentially other configuration files, an attacker can potentially gain further access and control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP requests to the device's web server.
- **URL Encoding:**  Attackers use URL encoded directory traversal sequences (`%2e%2e%2f`) to navigate the file system and access unauthorized files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the Onkyo receiver or have the ability to route to it.
- **Knowledge of the target:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target receiver.
- **HTTP tools:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, such as using tools like Burpsuite.
