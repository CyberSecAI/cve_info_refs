| --- | --- |
| CERT [VU#845620](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/845620) | It is theoretically possible for an attacker to forge RSA signatures when the RSA key has a public exponent of three. SecureCRT® version 5.2.1 and earlier, SecureFX® version 4.0.1 and earlier, and VShell® version 2.6.2 and earlier for Windows, Red Hat Linux, HP-UX, AIX, and Solaris are potentially vulnerable to this attack. |

#### Advisories 2004

---

| **December 2004** |  |
| --- | --- |
| BugTraq 12122 | SecureCRT is reported prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability. It is reported that supplying an excessive string value to the application through the hostname field may trigger this vulnerability. Apparently, this causes the client application to crash.  SecureCRT 4.0.9 and earlier may be vulnerable when SSH2 is used. SecureCRT 4.1 or newer provides a fix for SSH2 connections. |
|  | [View Details](/support/advisory/2004/12/12122.html) |
| **November 2004** |  |
| Secunia [SA13275](https://secunia.com/advisories/13275/) | Secunia Advisory - SecureCRT Arbitrary Configuration Folder Specification Vulnerability. CRT™ and SecureCRT 4.0 and 4.1 allow an arbitrary configuration folder to be specified to the "telnet:" URI handler via the "/F" command-line option. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary commands via a malicious logon script with the privileges of the user running CRT or SecureCRT. This vulnerability is only applicable to users who have made CRT or SecureCRT their default Telnet client. |
|  | [View Details](/support/advisory/2004/11/112304.html) |

| CERT [VU#550464](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/550464) | CERT Vulnerability Note - Remote denial-of-service vulnerability in the KDC and libraries.  **Not Applicable to VanDyke Software Products.** CERT has released a security advisory affecting MIT Kerberos 5 versions 1.3.4 and earlier. Although VanDyke products are not affected, there may be installations of VShell within an MIT Kerberos 5 environment which support Kerberos authentications through GSSAPI. In such cases, administrators are strongly encouraged to update MIT Kerberos to a version later than 1.3.4. |
|  | For more information on this vulnerability, including information regarding fixes for these vulnerabilities, please visit: [MIT Kerberos Security Advisories](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/) |

| CERT [VU#997481](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/997481) | CERT Vulnerability Note - Timing Attack Vulnerabilities "Cryptographic libraries and applications do not adequately defend against timing attacks." SecureCRT 4.0.4 and earlier may be vulnerable when SSH1 is used. SSH2 connections are not affected by the vulnerability. No other VanDyke Software product is affected by this vulnerability. SecureCRT 4.0.9 or newer provides a fix for SSH1 connections. |
|  | [View Details](/support/advisory/2003/03/997481.html) |

| **January 29, 2003** |  |
| --- | --- |

#### Advisories 2002

---

| **July 25, 2002** |  |
| --- | --- |
| BugTraq | VanDyke Software released SecureCRT version 3.4.8 and version SecureCRT 4.0.9 or newer to eliminate a security issue in SecureCRT 2.x, 3.x, 4.0 beta 2 or earlier. The issue made SecureCRT vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack which could allow malicious parties to execute arbitrary code when connecting to an SSH1 server that has been modified to perform this exploit. SSH2 connections are not affected by the vulnerability. |
|  | [View Details](/support/advisory/2002/07/072502.html) |
