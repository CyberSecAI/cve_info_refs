Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-12497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the parsing of PLCopen XML files within Phoenix Contact PC Worx and PC Worx Express. Specifically, when parsing the `pou` element, the software does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack buffer. The `name` attribute of the `pou` element is also vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121): Occurs due to insufficient input validation when handling user-supplied data during the parsing of XML files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.
- Compromised workstation: Availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the application programming workstation might be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Malicious PLCopen XML file: The attacker needs to manipulate a PC Worx project file and then exchange the original file with the manipulated one on the programming workstation. The user has to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Access to a valid PC Worx project
- Ability to manipulate data within the project folder
- Ability to replace the original files on the programming workstation with the manipulated versions.
- User interaction is required (opening a malicious file)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Phoenix Contact PC Worx and PC Worx Express versions 1.87 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor by Natnael Samson working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- A similar vulnerability exists with mwe file parsing in the same software (CVE-2020-12498).
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by using secure file exchange services and verifying file integrity with checksums.
- A fix was planned for future versions of Automation Worx Software Suite.
