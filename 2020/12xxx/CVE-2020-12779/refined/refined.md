Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12779:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the iTop application's audit page displaying an error message and the invalid OQL query without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (the OQL query) before displaying it in an error message on the audit page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the error message displayed on the audit page. This code could be executed in the context of a user's browser session when they access the audit page with a crafted OQL query.
- Exploitation could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
   - Stealing user session cookies.
   - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
   - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious OQL query crafted by the attacker. The attacker needs to induce a user (typically an administrator) to use this crafted query on the audit page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft an OQL query containing malicious JavaScript code. They then need to find a way to make the victim use this crafted OQL query within the iTop application. This is likely achieved through social engineering. The target would need to have access to the audit page to view the resulting error message.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in iTop versions prior to 2.7.1 and 3.0.0.
- The vulnerability has been patched in versions 2.7.1 and 3.0.0.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by TW/CERT.
