Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `RecordingService.java` file of BigBlueButton. Specifically, the `getDownloadablePresentationFile` method concatenates the absolute path of a presentation directory, a separator character, and a user-supplied filename parameter (`presFilename`) without validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `presFilename` parameter to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), enabling access to arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is an LFI flaw. By providing a crafted `presFilename`, an attacker can read files outside the intended presentation directory.
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability leverages path traversal techniques to navigate directories on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerable code does not sanitize or validate the `presFilename` parameter before using it to construct the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, user data, or system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `presFilename` parameter in an HTTP request to the BigBlueButton server.
*   **Direct Request:** An attacker can directly craft a malicious URL with the modified `presFilename` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the BigBlueButton server.
*   **Knowledge of File Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the server's file system to craft the appropriate path traversal sequences.
*  **Valid meetingId, presId:** The attacker needs a valid meetingId and presId to form a valid URL, which usually can be obtained from a meeting.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a PoC demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The fix implemented in version 2.2.4 includes an HTTP server configuration rule that restricts the allowed values for `presFilename`, preventing path traversal attacks. The fix involves a regular expression to validate `presFilename` and a specific format.
* The vulnerability was discovered by a student who noticed the filename was included in the URL.
* The BigBlueButton team responded quickly to the report and patched the vulnerability.
