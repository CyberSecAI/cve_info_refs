The content is related to CVE-2020-12076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Data Tables Generator by Supsystic plugin lacks CSRF protection on all AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of WordPress nonces on AJAX actions, combined with insecure permissions allowing subscriber-level users to execute these actions. This lack of CSRF protection could be chained with an authenticated Stored XSS vulnerability via the same AJAX endpoints.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment, leading to a forged request that could:
- modify data table settings
- inject malicious JavaScript into data tables
- create new data tables
- rename existing data tables
- potentially create new admin users or redirect users to malicious sites

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious links or attachments that trick an authenticated user into submitting a forged request.
- Exploiting the lack of CSRF protection to send malicious requests via the AJAX actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user (any user, even subscriber) into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment to trigger a forged request. The attacker does not need any special access to the WordPress admin panel and doesn't need to be logged in.
