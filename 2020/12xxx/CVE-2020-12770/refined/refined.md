Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12770:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the SCSI generic (sg) driver in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `sg_write` function does not properly release internal resources under certain error conditions, specifically when `copy_from_user` fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Resource Leak: The sg driver fails to deallocate resources when `copy_from_user` fails during a write operation.
- Missing error handling: The `sg_write` function does not call the `sg_remove_request` function when `copy_from_user` fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A local attacker with the ability to access an sg device can cause a resource exhaustion by repeatedly triggering the error condition in the `sg_write` function causing the system to crash or become unstable.
- Kernel information leak: It was also mentioned in one of the bug reports that a kernel internal information leak is also possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs local access to the system.
- Access to sg device: The attacker must have the ability to access a SCSI generic device (e.g., /dev/sg0).
- Privileged attacker: The attacker needs special user or root privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user or root access on the system.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to open and write to an sg device.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this issue involves calling `sg_remove_request` if `copy_from_user` fails in the `sg_write` function to properly deallocate internal resources.
- The fix is included in various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora.
- The affected kernel versions vary based on the distribution.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the patches released by the distributions.
