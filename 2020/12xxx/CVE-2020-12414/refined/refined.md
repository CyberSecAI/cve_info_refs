Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `WKWebViewConfiguration` in Firefox for iOS when handling private browsing mode. Specifically, the configuration for `WKWebView` was set to non-persistent *after* the `WKWebView` construction, and the same configuration was reused across private tabs. This resulted in the IndexedDB persisting even after closing all private tabs and the private window, contrary to user expectations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Data persistence in private mode:** IndexedDB data was not being cleared as expected when private browsing mode was exited in Firefox for iOS.
- **Incorrect use of `WKWebViewConfiguration`:** The `nonPersistent` property was being set on a `WKWebViewConfiguration` object after the `WKWebView` was created. Also, the configuration object was being re-used instead of creating new one each time a private browsing session was started.
- **Privacy violation:** The persistence of IndexedDB data allowed websites to track users across private browsing sessions, which is a privacy breach.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **User Tracking:** Websites could track users across different private browsing sessions. This defeats the purpose of private browsing, which is designed to prevent such tracking.
- **Privacy Violation:** The user's expectation of privacy when using private browsing was violated, as browsing data intended to be temporary was being persisted.
- **Data Retention:** Data was retained on the device even after the user expected it to be deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious website could exploit this by using IndexedDB to store data within a private browsing session and track users across sessions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to host or control a website that uses IndexedDB.
- The user would need to visit this malicious website within a private browsing tab in Firefox for iOS.
- The attacker has to exploit the vulnerability on the client-side (within the user's browser).

**Additional Information:**

- The bug report ([Bug 1646756](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1646756)) contains a detailed explanation of the issue, the fix, and the related code changes.
- The fix involved setting the `WKWebViewConfiguration` to `nonPersistent` *before* constructing the `TabWebView`.
- The fix also included changes to ensure that a new `WKWebViewConfiguration` object is used every time a new private tab is created, and the configuration is cleared when the number of private tabs goes to zero.
- The issue was categorized as "sec-moderate" severity, indicating a moderate security risk.
- The fix was included in Firefox for iOS version 27.
