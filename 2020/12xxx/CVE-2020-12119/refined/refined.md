{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Ledger Live software increases the userâ€™s balance with the value of an unconfirmed transaction as soon as it is received (before the transaction is confirmed) and does not decrease the balance when it is cancelled due to Replace-By-Fee (RBF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect balance calculation in Ledger Live due to mishandling of RBF transactions.",
    "Failure to properly account for cancelled unconfirmed transactions."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can trick a victim into believing a Bitcoin transaction is confirmed when it is not, leading to financial losses if goods or services are provided based on the incorrect balance. The 'send max' feature might also be blocked.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers send a victim a transaction with minimal fees which will be pending. The attacker then cancels the transaction using RBF. Ledger Live will still display the transaction as confirmed, misleading the user into believing that they received funds.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create and cancel Bitcoin transactions using RBF, they need to know the victim's Bitcoin address."
