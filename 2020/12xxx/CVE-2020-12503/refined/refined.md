Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12503:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the ping functionality of the web interface, which allows for the injection of system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The web interface's ping functionality does not sanitize user-supplied input, enabling attackers to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Semi-Blind:** The command injection is semi-blind, meaning the attacker doesn't receive direct output in the initial request. Instead, the output is retrieved via a separate request.
- **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability can be exploited through CSRF attacks because there is no protection implemented against this kind of attack on the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.
- This could allow them to take full control of the device, modify settings, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the vulnerable web interface of the affected devices.
- **CSRF:** Attackers can use CSRF techniques to trick authenticated users into sending malicious requests to the device, executing arbitrary commands without the user's knowledge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface.
- **Authenticated User:** Although the command injection itself does not require authentication, it is triggered within the context of an authenticated session. The CSRF attack relies on a logged-in user to unintentionally execute the malicious commands on the device. The attacker must find a way to lure the user into visiting a malicious site or link, triggering the CSRF request.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker sends a POST request to the `/goform/formping` endpoint with the malicious command injected into the `PingIPAddress` parameter:
  ```
  POST /goform/formping HTTP/1.1
  ...
  PingIPAddress=;id;&submit-url=%2Ftoolping.asp&Submit=Ping
  ```
- The output of the injected command is retrieved with a GET request to the `/toolping.asp` endpoint.

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerability affects multiple devices from the following vendors:
- Korenix JetNet series (multiple devices)
- Westermo PMI-110-F2G Managed PoE Gigabit Switch
- Pepperl+Fuchs Comtrol RocketLinx Series
