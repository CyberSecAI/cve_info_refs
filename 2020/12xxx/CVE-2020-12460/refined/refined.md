{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-12460",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "The provided content details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenDMARC due to improper null termination in the opendmarc_xml_parse function during parsing of DMARC aggregate reports. This can lead to denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause of vulnerability",
      "detail": "The root cause is an improper null termination. The function `opendmarc_xml_parse()` does not explicitly add a null terminator ('\\0') to the buffer holding the XML data after reading the contents from a report file, leading to an off-by-one error."
    },
    {
      "type": "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present",
      "detail": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, specifically a one-byte heap overflow. A null byte is written beyond the allocated buffer, overwriting heap metadata (specifically the PREV_INUSE flag) of the next chunk."
    },
    {
      "type": "Impact of exploitation",
      "detail": "The impact of exploitation includes a denial of service due to memory corruption leading to a crash when the buffer is freed, and potentially arbitrary code execution depending on how libopendmarc is used and integrated into the application, especially if the opendmarc_xml function is used explicitly without calling opendmarc_xml_parse and with input that is not null-terminated."
    },
    {
      "type": "Attack vectors",
      "detail": "The attack vector is a specially crafted DMARC aggregate report that, when parsed by the vulnerable function, triggers the heap overflow."
    },
      {
      "type": "Required attacker capabilities/position",
      "detail": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted DMARC aggregate report to be parsed by the vulnerable application utilizing the opendmarc library. This is typically done remotely."
    }
  ],
  "affected_versions": "OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1 are affected",
    "remediation": "Upgrade to OpenDMARC version 1.3.3 or later, or version 1.4.1 or later."
