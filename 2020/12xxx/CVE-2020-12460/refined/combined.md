## Description

![@pjlantz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/197917?u=2f73011adb0480604ae44b770a33d434e9274fe4&v=4&size=48)[pjlantz](https://github.com/pjlantz)opened [on Jul 25, 2020](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/issues/64#issue-665563517)

There is a memory corruption vulnerability in `opendmarc_xml()` of libopendmarc during parsing of DMARC aggregate reports. The versions affected by this seem to be OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1.

The root cause is improper null termination. The function opendmarc\_xml\_parse() does not explicitly add a null terminator ('\0') to the buffer holding the XML data after reading the contents from a report file. This can cause an off-by-one error in opendmarc\_xml() in certain cases depending on the report file, resulting in a one-byte heap overflow.

A null byte write occurs during the parsing at opendmarc\_xml.c:171, `*sp = '\0'`. Eventually, during parsing of a specially crafted report, this null byte will overflow to the next chunk on the heap, overwriting the heap metadata, as indicated by the following valgrind output.

```
==4014== Invalid write of size 1
==4014==    at 0x401223: opendmarc_xml (opendmarc_xml.c:171)
==4014==    by 0x4020DC: opendmarc_xml_parse (opendmarc_xml.c:614)
==4014==    by 0x400D23: main (in /home/peppe/Downloads/test)
==4014==  Address 0x5204478 is 0 bytes after a block of size 1,080 alloc'd
==4014==    at 0x4C2FB55: calloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==4014==    by 0x402070: opendmarc_xml_parse (opendmarc_xml.c:575)
==4014==    by 0x400D23: main (in /home/peppe/Downloads/test)

```

The size field and the least significant bits used as flags are overwritten in the metadata. The relevant flag for this vulnerability is the bit indicating 'previous chunk in use', known as PREV\_INUSE which will be set to zero and determines if the previous chunk (storing bufp) is free. When the buffer is later free'd at opendmarc\_xml.c:616, `(void) free(bufp)` - a crash occurs as `bufp` is listed as not used.

```
(gdb) run poc.xml

```

A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted report that is parsed by this library, causing a denial of service. It could possibly lead to code execution depending on how libopendmarc is used and integrated into the application, in particular if the opendmarc\_xml function is used explicitly without calling opendmarc\_xml\_parse and with input that is not null-terminated.

A DMARC aggregate report that triggers this vulnerability can be generated using the following commands:

```
printf '<feedback></feedback>' > poc.xml; printf 'A%.0s' {1..1053} >> poc.xml; printf '<begin' >> poc.xml

```

And, yes, I'm very aware upstream is famously & consistently non-responsive.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1861844#c1)  pgnet.dev    2020-08-13 02:06:38 UTC  ``` any response?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1861844#c2)  Tomas Korbar    2020-08-13 09:06:11 UTC  ``` Hi, sorry for the late response. Do i understand it correctly that you are running opendmarcs snapshot of the latest commit? If so, for how long? If it is truly stable then i see no problem in updating the package to the snapshot of latest commit. I see that in [0] there is version 1.4.0-beta1, would rebase to that version be sufficient?

I've been building from src, @ 'develop' branch, for years.  until recently, that's been on openSUSE & ubuntu.  It's been in production working with postfix instances with -- in my use case -- no problems.  ~ 2 months ago, I began migrating my production OS to Fedora32. lacking up-to-date pkgs, and _hoping_ to no longer DIY from source, I've been running my own pkgs, built on COPR.  fyi,  <https://download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org/results/pgfed/opendmarc/fedora-32-x86_64/01607172-opendmarc/opendmarc.spec>  ( & no, it's _not_ pkg'd 'properly' for official inclusion as a F32 pkg )  > I see that in [0] there is version 1.4.0-beta1, would rebase to that version be sufficient?  not IMO ...  1.4.0-Beta1 was 'released' on Nov 14, 2018 -- heading for 2 years ago.  There are 11 commits since,    <https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/compare/rel-opendmarc-1-4-0-Beta1...develop>  several of which are quite useful.  Given the almost complete non-responsiveness of the upstream dev @ "Trusted Domain Project", I don't trust the 'release' the slightest bit more than the branch tip.  IME -- & backed up with comments from others -- building the latest commit has been reliable.  The *right* solution is to find & switch-to a well-maintained project; not a lot of options available afaict.  Yes, there's effort on developing OpenARC as 'next gen' solution ... but, frankly, it's from the same folks; _not_ holding my breath ...  Bottom line? *I* build & use the latest commit.  It works, *here*. I think others might be interested as well.  But, I cannot guarantee it's a 'safe bet'.  Hence, the quandary ...   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1861844#c4)  Ben Cotton    2020-11-03 16:44:33 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 31 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 31 on 2020-11-24. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '31'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 31 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1861844#c5)  Tomas Korbar    2021-02-22 08:27:46 UTC  ``` Hi, unfortunately i do not have time to maintain Opendmarc.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2639-1              debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : opendmarc
Version        : 1.3.2-2+deb9u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12460
Debian Bug     : 966464

It was discovered that OpenDMARC, a milter implementation of DMARC,
has improper null termination in the function opendmarc_xml_parse that
can result in a one-byte heap overflow in opendmarc_xml when parsing a
specially crafted DMARC aggregate report. This can cause remote memory
corruption when a '\0' byte overwrites the heap metadata of the next
chunk and its PREV_INUSE flag.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.3.2-2+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your opendmarc packages.

For the detailed security status of opendmarc please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opendmarc>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-433e7d72ce
2021-05-31 01:04:19.558515
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opendmarc
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 1.4.1
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://www.trusteddomain.org/opendmarc.html>
Summary : A Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) milter and library
Description :
OpenDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
provides an open source library that implements the DMARC verification
service plus a milter-based filter application that can plug in to any
milter-aware MTA, including sendmail, Postfix, or any other MTA that supports
the milter protocol.

The DMARC sender authentication system is still a draft standard, working
towards RFC status.

The database schema required for some functions is provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/db. The rddmarc tools are provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/contrib/rddmarc.

# OpenDMARC: Heap-based buffer overflow â GLSA **202011-02**

A heap-based buffer overflow in OpenDMARC might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-filter/opendmarc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.3** |

### Background

OpenDMARC is an open source DMARC implementation.

### Description

It was found that OpenDMARC did not properly handle DMARC aggregate
reports.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by sending a specially crafted DMARC aggregate
report, could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition and depending
on how OpenDMARC library is used in linked application execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenDMARC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/opendmarc-1.3.3"

```

Name : opendmarc
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 1.4.1
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <http://www.trusteddomain.org/opendmarc.html>
Summary : A Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) milter and library
Description :
OpenDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
provides an open source library that implements the DMARC verification
service plus a milter-based filter application that can plug in to any
milter-aware MTA, including sendmail, Postfix, or any other MTA that supports
the milter protocol.

The DMARC sender authentication system is still a draft standard, working
towards RFC status.

The database schema required for some functions is provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/db. The rddmarc tools are provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/contrib/rddmarc.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
