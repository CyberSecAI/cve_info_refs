- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The certificate used to identify the Silver Peak Cloud Portal to EdgeConnect devices is not validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can establish a TLS connection from an EdgeConnect device to an untrusted portal.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where an attacker redirects the EdgeConnect device to a malicious portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept and redirect network traffic between the EdgeConnect device and the legitimate Cloud Portal.
