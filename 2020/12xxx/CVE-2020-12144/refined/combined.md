Silver Peak Security Advisory

Notification

Security Advisory 2020-04-24-01-003: The certificate used to identify the Silver Peak
Cloud Portal to EdgeConnect devices is not validated

CVE ID:   CVE-2020-12144

 Vulnerability Type:   CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation

Details
The certificate used to identify the Silver Peak Cloud Portal to EdgeConnect devices is not validated. This
makes it possible for someone to establish a TLS connection from EdgeConnect to an untrusted portal.

Resolution

•  Changes have been made to strengthen the initial exchange between EdgeConnect appliances

and the Cloud Portal. After the changes, EdgeConnect will validate the certificate used to identify
the Silver Peak Cloud Portal to EdgeConnect.

•  TLS itself is continually subject to newly discovered and exploitable vulnerabilities. As such, all
versions of EdgeConnect software implement additional out-of-band and user-controlled
authentication mechanisms.

Recommended Actions for Silver Peak Customers

•  Do not change Cloud Portal’s IP address as discovered by EdgeConnect appliances.
•  Upgrade to Silver Peak Unity ECOS™ 8.3.0.4+ or 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity

•

Orchestrator™ 8.9.2+.
In Orchestrator, enable the “Verify Cloud Portal Certificate” option under Advanced
Security Settings.
