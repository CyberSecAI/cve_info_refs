Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the Source Engine's launcher when handling relaunch commands on both macOS and Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **macOS:** The launcher checks for the existence of the `/tmp/hl2_relaunch` file. If it exists, its content is used to construct a command which is then executed by the `system()` call, without any sanitization or escaping. This allows for arbitrary command injection.
*   **Windows:** The launcher checks for the `Relaunch URL` registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Source`. If present, the value of this key is used in a `ShellExecute` call. While it is not possible to specify parameters, any executable or associated file can be triggered using this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **macOS:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the game. This can be leveraged to gain a shell.
*  **Windows:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the game. An attacker can use a UNC path to point to an SMB share, leading to code execution and potentially capturing the user's NTLM credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **macOS:**  An attacker needs to create or modify `/tmp/hl2_relaunch` with a malicious command before the game is launched.
*   **Windows:** An attacker needs to set or modify the `Relaunch URL` registry key with a UNC path to a malicious file on a controlled SMB share before the game is launched.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **macOS:**  The attacker needs local write access to the `/tmp/` directory to create or modify the `/tmp/hl2_relaunch` file.
*   **Windows:** The attacker needs write access to the user's registry to modify or add the `Relaunch URL` registry key. Additionally, they need to set up a SMB share to host a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Source Engine games, not just CS:GO.
*   The issue was reported to Valve via HackerOne but was initially denied.
*   The author of the blog post highlights that the vulnerability allows for local privilege escalation or local arbitrary code execution.
*   The post provides details of affected game build numbers
