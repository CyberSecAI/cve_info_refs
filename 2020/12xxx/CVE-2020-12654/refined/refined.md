  "CVE-2020-12654": {
    "description": "It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `mwifiex_ret_wmm_get_status()` function in the mwifiex driver calls memcpy without checking the destination size, which may lead to a heap buffer overflow when the source from a remote AP contains illegal WMM elements.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient validation of remote input"
      ],
      "impact": "A heap buffer overflow that can lead to denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious Access Point (AP) sending crafted WMM parameters to the affected device.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control a WiFi access point and be within range of the vulnerable device. No specific user interaction is needed on the victim.",
