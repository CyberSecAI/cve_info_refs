Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12803:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from LibreOffice's handling of form submissions within ODF documents. Specifically, the application allowed form submissions to any URI, including `file:` URIs. This allowed a crafted ODF document to potentially overwrite local files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted URI handling:** LibreOffice did not restrict the type of URI to which form data could be submitted.
*   **File overwrite vulnerability:** By allowing `file:` URIs, it was possible for a malicious document to overwrite files on the user's local system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Local file overwrite:** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary files on the user's system being overwritten.
*   **Potential for further compromise:** Overwriting specific files could have broader implications, potentially leading to system compromise, data corruption, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted ODF document:** An attacker would need to create a malicious ODF document containing a form configured to submit data to a `file:` URI.
*   **User interaction:** The user must open the malicious ODF document in LibreOffice and then submit the form within the document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create ODF documents:** The attacker needs to be able to create ODF files that include forms.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious document.
*  **No specific network position is required:** The document can be delivered by any means, like email or download, or even placed on a local file share.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in LibreOffice versions prior to 6.4.4.
*   The fix limits form submissions to `http[s]` URIs, removing the possibility of overwriting local files.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity by SUSE.
*   The attack requires user interaction.
*   The provided text also includes information about the fix in various distributions including SUSE, openSUSE and Debian.

This CVE is about unrestricted URI handling allowing local file overwrite.
