{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Keystone does not check the signature TTL of the EC2 credential authentication method.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of a signature TTL check for AWS Signature V4 in Keystone's EC2 API. The timestamp in the request is not validated against a TTL.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who can sniff the authorization header of an EC2 token request can reuse it to obtain OpenStack tokens indefinitely.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the auth header, or gaining access to debug logs containing the header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to intercept network traffic or gain access to logs containing the authorization header."
