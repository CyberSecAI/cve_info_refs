  ## vBulletin 5.5.6, 5.6.0, 5.6.1 Security Patch Level 1

  Thu 7 May '20, 11:40am

  A security exploit has been reported within vBulletin 5.6.1 and earlier versions. To fix this issue, we have created a new security patch.

  You can download the patch for your version in the [Member's Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php)

  We have made patches available for the following versions of vBulletin Connect:

  + 5.6.1 Patch Level 1
  + 5.6.0 Patch Level 1
  + 5.5.6 Patch Level 1
  ## Installing the Patch

  1. Download the appropriate files for your version of vBulletin.
  2. Upload all files found within the zip file. Make sure to overwrite the existing files on your server.
  ## Older Versions

  If you are using a version of vBulletin 5 Connect prior to 5.5.6, it is imperative that you upgrade as soon as possible. For more information on upgrading please see [Quick Overview: Upgrading vBulletin Connect](https://forum.vbulletin.com/node/4391346) in the support forums.

  ## vBulletin Cloud

  This security patch has already been applied to all vBulletin Cloud sites.

###### Technical Analysis

Vuln affects versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.4 and is weaponized in the form of a Metasploit module: <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/13512>

Credit to Charles Fol for discovery and Zenofex for fast analysis and slick weaponization.

I keep thinking that it‚Äôs unlikely enterprises use vBulletin and this must be more of a risk to small- and medium-sized businesses, but looking at some of the companies that are said to be vBulletin customers, I suppose that‚Äôs not necessarily true.

  ## vBulletin 5.5.6, 5.6.0, 5.6.1 Security Patch Level 1

  Thu 7 May '20, 11:40am

  A security exploit has been reported within vBulletin 5.6.1 and earlier versions. To fix this issue, we have created a new security patch.

  You can download the patch for your version in the [Member's Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php)

  We have made patches available for the following versions of vBulletin Connect:

  + 5.6.1 Patch Level 1
  + 5.6.0 Patch Level 1
  + 5.5.6 Patch Level 1
  ## Installing the Patch

  1. Download the appropriate files for your version of vBulletin.
  2. Upload all files found within the zip file. Make sure to overwrite the existing files on your server.
  ## Older Versions

  If you are using a version of vBulletin 5 Connect prior to 5.5.6, it is imperative that you upgrade as soon as possible. For more information on upgrading please see [Quick Overview: Upgrading vBulletin Connect](https://forum.vbulletin.com/node/4391346) in the support forums.

  ## vBulletin Cloud

  This security patch has already been applied to all vBulletin Cloud sites.
