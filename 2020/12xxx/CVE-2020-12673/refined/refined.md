```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Dovecot's NTLM implementation does not correctly check the message buffer size.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Out-of-bounds read due to missing buffer size check in NTLM authentication handling.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the Dovecot authentication service, preventing logins.

Attack vectors:
A remote attacker can send a specially crafted NTLM authentication message.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted NTLM authentication request to the Dovecot server. No specific user credentials or prior authentication is needed.
