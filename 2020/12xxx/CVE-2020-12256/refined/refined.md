The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2020-12256.

**CVE-2020-12256**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `devicemgmt.php` file of rConfig 3.9.4. Specifically, the `deviceId` GET parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in the application logic.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. In the provided text, the exploit is demonstrated using `alert(document.cookie)` to display cookies.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code injected into the `deviceId` GET parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to induce a user to visit the crafted URL, typically using phishing attacks or social engineering.

The content also describes two other vulnerabilities:

*   **CVE-2020-12259**
    *   **Vulnerability**: XSS via the `rid` GET parameter in `configDevice.php` using a similar method as CVE-2020-12256.
*   **CVE-2020-12258**
    *   **Vulnerability**: Session fixation due to the lack of randomization of the session ID and reuse of session IDs. This can be combined with the XSS vulnerabilities to set a session id for a user which can lead to account takeover.
