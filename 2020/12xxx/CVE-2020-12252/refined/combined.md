# Fulldisclosure -- Improving network security through full disclosure

## About Fulldisclosure

The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The [full disclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!

This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the [grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list](http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html) started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and [terminated abruptly in March 2014](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332) due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.

This list is run by and for the network security community. Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our [moderation guidelines](https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation). Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short. When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.

You must join the list before you can post to it. Submit posts to fulldisclosure@seclists.org. If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in [list config](https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure).

Posts are publicly archived at the [Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure) and the list RSS feed is available there too. Various unofficial archives exist as well. You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the [X-No-Archive mail header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive) in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.

Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk! In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.

# Gigamon - GigaVUE 0day

Hi,

An issue was discovered in Gigamon GigaVUE 5.5.01.11.
The upload functionality allows an authenticated user to change the
filename value (in the POST method) from the original filename
to achieve directory traversal via a ../ sequence and, for example,
obtain a complete directory listing of the machine.

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
This vulnerability aid the attacker in discovering the whole file
system in the underlying host system - including identifying the
writeable and read-only file systems.

The authenticated user needs to use the upload functionality. The POST
HTTP verb is being used which needs to be intercepted, and modified
(the "filename" parameter must be manipulated in the POST body
section)

These vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor. They said this
version will be decommissioned in 2023 and they decided not to provide
technical support anymore. In other words, they will not fix any IT
Security Issues which have lower than critical risk. This
version is in production in enterprise environments, and will be
available until end of 2023, so the impact is real.

Use CVE-2020-12251.

An issue was discovered in Gigamon GigaVUE 5.5.01.11. The upload
functionality allows an arbitrary file upload for an authenticated
user. If an executable file is uploaded into the www-root directory,
then it could yield remote code execution via the filename parameter.

[Additional Information]
These vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor. They said this
version will be decommissioned in 2023 and they decided not to provide
technical support anymore. In other words, they will not fix any IT
