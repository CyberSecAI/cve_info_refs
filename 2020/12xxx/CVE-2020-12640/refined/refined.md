  "CVE-2020-12640": {
    "description": "Roundcube Webmail before 1.4.4 allows attackers to include local files and execute code via directory traversal in a plugin name to rcube_plugin_api.php.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in Roundcube versions before 1.4.4, 1.3.11 and 1.2.10. The '_plugins_<PLUGIN_NAME>' parameters do not perform sanitization/input filtering, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary PHP files on the local system.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal",
        "Local File Inclusion",
	 "Code Execution"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can leverage a path traversal vulnerability to include arbitrary PHP files on the local system. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted POST request to the Roundcube installer, specifically through the vulnerable `_plugins_` parameters.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the Roundcube Installer, which is usually intended to be restricted, to exploit the vulnerability."
