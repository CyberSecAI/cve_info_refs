Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A logic flaw in the Firefox location bar implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The location bar fails to properly update its displayed state when a top site is selected using the keyboard and then the selection is canceled by either pressing the escape key or clicking elsewhere without selecting the site.
- The location bar persists in displaying the selected top site's URL as if it were the current site, including security indicators (padlock, shield), while the actual page being viewed is different.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **URL Spoofing:** A local attacker can make the browser's location bar display a different origin (URL) than the actual page being viewed, leading to user confusion and potential phishing. This is a visual deception, and the browser is still displaying the content of the correct origin.
- **Phishing:** The spoofed location bar, combined with the security indicators (padlock and site permissions), could trick a user into thinking they are on a legitimate site when they are not.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker with physical access to a user's computer can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker navigates to a legitimate website.
- The attacker focuses the location bar using the keyboard.
- The attacker highlights a different (potentially malicious) URL from the Top Sites suggestions using keyboard arrow keys.
- The attacker then removes focus from the location bar by pressing escape or clicking somewhere else without selecting the site.
- The location bar will incorrectly display the URL of the highlighted top site instead of the actual URL of the loaded web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access to the victim's computer is required.
- Basic knowledge of how to interact with Firefox using keyboard is required.
