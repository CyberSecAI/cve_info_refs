Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-12812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper authentication in FortiOS SSL VPN.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from the system's failure to properly handle username case sensitivity during authentication. If a user alters the case of their username (e.g., from "User" to "user"), they might bypass the multi-factor authentication (MFA) process.
