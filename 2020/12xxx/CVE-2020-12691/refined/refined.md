  "response": {
    "relevant": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in keystone's EC2 credentials API where the `_build_target_enforcement` function only checks for `credential_id` during updates, allowing modifications to the `user_id` and `project_id` attributes, and any other metadata fields, of a credential by an authenticated user. Additionally, when creating a credential, it is possible to create it with any existing `project_id`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control during credential updates.",
      "Lack of proper validation when creating EC2 credentials.",
      "Inadequate policy enforcement on credential endpoints"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can create an EC2 credential, then update its `user_id` and `project_id`, potentially impersonating another user, including administrators. This could lead to privilege escalation, enabling the malicious user to act as an admin on a project another user has admin privileges on, potentially gaining global admin privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker exploits the keystone's EC2 credentials API by creating an EC2 credential for themself, then using the insecure update functionality of the `/credentials` endpoint to change the `user_id` and `project_id` to that of the victim user.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment, and should know or guess the UUID of the target user and project they wish to impersonate. Note that, in certain OpenStack environments, user listing is allowed, and project IDs may be easily available, which would facilitate a successful exploitation of the vulnerability."
