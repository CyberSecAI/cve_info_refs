  "cveId": "CVE-2020-12109",
  "date": "2020-04-29",
  "description": "TP-LINK Cloud Cameras NCXXX Bonjour Command Injection",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `swSystemSetProductAliasCheck` method of the `ipcamera` binary, which is called when setting a new alias for the device. While there's a check on the name length, no checks are performed to prevent the introduction of shell metacharacters. The system name is then used in `swBonjourStartHTTP` as part of a shell command, allowing for arbitrary command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input sanitization of the system name, specifically regarding shell metacharacters.",
      "Use of unsanitized user input within a system command."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can remotely execute commands as root on affected devices.",
     "attackVectors": "The attacker needs to authenticate to the web interface and send a crafted POST request to `/setsysname.fcgi` to inject shell commands into the `sysname` parameter." ,
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to authenticate to the web interface of the TP-Link camera."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    "TP-LINK NC200 <= 2.1.9 build 200225",
    "TP-LINK NC210 <= 1.0.9 build 200304",
    "TP-LINK NC220 <= 1.3.0 build 200304",
    "TP-LINK NC230 <= 1.3.0 build 200304",
    "TP-LINK NC250 <= 1.3.0 build 200304",
    "TP-LINK NC260 <= 1.5.2 build 200304",
    "TP-LINK NC450 <= 1.5.3 build 200304"
  ],
   "remediation": "Install firmware updates provided by the vendor.",
    "additionalNotes": "Some cameras may have a filter for certain characters like dot, at, dash, underscore, whitespace, and single quote which may limit payload options. Some cameras do not have `telnetd` included in the firmware so an attacker may need to use other methods to obtain a shell, like using `wget` or `curl` to download a payload from the network."
