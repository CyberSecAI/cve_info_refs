- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specific, rarely used combination of constructs in the ALGOL syntax could cause invalid code sequences to be generated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the Algol compiler emitting invalid code sequences under rare circumstances. This is categorized as CWE-1075 (Undefined Behavior).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to random side effects, including system faults. The impact is rated as HIGH.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring local access to the affected system. Low access complexity (AC:L) and low privileges (PR:L) are required. No user interaction (UI:N) is required. The scope is changed (S:C), leading to impacts beyond the vulnerable component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to compile and execute ALGOL code. The attacker needs to use the specific, rarely used combination of ALGOL constructs that trigger the bug.
