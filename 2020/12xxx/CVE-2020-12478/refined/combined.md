# Some Teampass files are available without authentication #2764

## Description

![@bstapes](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20693610?v=4&size=48)[bstapes](https://github.com/bstapes)opened [on Apr 2, 2020](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/issues/2764#issue-592756360)

Many of the files included in Teampass are available without authentication to anyone who can interact with the web server. While this may not be an issue for some of the images or Javascript files, it is an issue for the user-uploaded files that are available without authentication.

These include:

* upload dir - all file uploads (encrypted)
* avatars dir - all profile pictures
* backups dir - (presumably) Teampass backups
  + Note that accessing the scripts here can also trigger the backups to run
* files dir
  + PDFs generated via admin functions are saved here
* many files under the “includes” directory
* miscellaneous files under web root (license.md, changelog.txt, Dockerfile, etc)

Additionally, it does not appear that Teampass checks to see if directory listing is turned on on the web server. This feature is frequently on by default and when left on, makes it easy to discover the hashed file names that are sometimes used.

**Steps to reproduce**

Use a simple curl request to retrieve one of the files I noted above. EG:

`curl http://<your teampass instance>/teampass/files/ldap.debug.txt`

**Steps to fix**

* Review what files and directories should be exposed without authentication
* Ensure that only authenticated users can attempt to access files in sensitive directories (upload, backups, files, etc)
* Ensure that only authorized users can actually retrieve files in sensitive directories

### Server configuration

**Teampass version:**
