The provided content is related to CVE-2020-12478.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that many files and directories in the TeamPass application are accessible without any authentication. This includes sensitive data like user-uploaded files, profile pictures, backups, generated PDFs, and various files under the "includes" directory, as well as miscellaneous files in the web root.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of authentication:** The primary weakness is that Teampass does not enforce proper authentication checks for accessing sensitive files and directories.
- **Insecure directory access:** The application does not verify or control directory listing settings of the web server. If directory listing is enabled on the web server, it makes it easier to discover the hashed file names.
- **Sensitive data exposure:** User uploaded files, backups, generated pdfs, and other files are exposed without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, including:
    - Encrypted user-uploaded files
    - Profile pictures
    - Teampass backups
    - PDFs generated by admin functions
    - Various "includes" directory files
    - Potentially, database backups, and configuration files.
    - Execute backup scripts, if exposed through the backup directory.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct URL access:** An attacker can directly access the files by knowing the file paths and sending direct HTTP requests to the server. For example, using a curl command as provided in the description.
- **Directory browsing:** If directory listing is enabled on the web server, an attacker can easily explore the directories and discover the file names.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the TeamPass application.
- **Knowledge of file paths:** The attacker needs to be aware of the paths to the sensitive files and directories. This can be guessed or discovered through techniques such as directory brute-forcing or, if enabled on the server, via directory listing.
