{
  "CVE-2020-12419": {
    "Description": "When processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent process, the associated window may die; causing a use-after-free condition. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition occurs when callbacks are processed during window flushing in the parent process, potentially causing the associated window to die prematurely.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free condition"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.",
      "Attack vectors": [
          "Triggering callbacks during window flushing in the parent process."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have access to the parent process to call the `promiseDocumentFlushed` method."
  }
