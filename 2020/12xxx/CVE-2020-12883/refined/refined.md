{
  "CVE-2020-12883": {
    "status": "RELEVANT",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `sn_coap_parser_options_parse()` function within the CoAP library of Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The function incorrectly handles the parsing of CoAP options, specifically related to option delta and option length bytes. It does not validate the input packet length against the number of bytes read when processing extended delta and length, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds Read",
        "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause the application to read data outside of the intended buffer which can result in a crash or processing of unintended inputs, potentially leading to system memory access violations.",
      "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted CoAP packet with specific option delta and length values to the affected device.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target device running the vulnerable CoAP library."
    },
    "additional_info": {
        "affected_versions": "MbedOS mbed-coap library 5.1.5, MbedOS 5.15.3",
        "vulnerable_code": "The vulnerability occurs in the sn_coap_parser_options_parse() function. Specifically, the message_left calculation and checks for extended option deltas and lengths are insufficient or incorrect",
        "example_trace": "```\nExample Trace:\n    #0  sn_coap_parser_options_parse_uint()\n        sn_coap_parser.c:257\n    #1  sn_coap_parser_options_parse()\n        sn_coap_parser.c:531\n    #2  sn_coap_parser()\n        sn_coap_parser.c:161\n```",
         "incorrect_message_length_calculation": "The remaining message length is calculated without incrementing the packet data pointer prior to the calculation, which causes a malformed message to pass checks.",
         "short_option_length_handling":"For short options length, the remaining message length is unchanged after option length processing, which incorrectly passes the length check.",
         "pointer_increment_beyond_buffer":"In option processing code, the packet data pointer is incremented beyond the input buffer boundary and passed for further processing, leading to out-of-bounds reads."
      }
