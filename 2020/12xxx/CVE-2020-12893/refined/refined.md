Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-12893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Stack Buffer Overflow** in the AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10. Specifically, it occurs within the `Escape 0x15002a` call handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The driver does not properly validate the size of the input data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. This lack of bounds checking allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** An attacker could potentially overwrite parts of the stack, including return addresses or other critical data, to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow could cause the driver to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Escape Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specific escape call interface (`Escape 0x15002a`) in the AMD graphics driver. Escape calls are a mechanism for user-mode applications to communicate with kernel-mode drivers.
*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft malicious input data to the specified escape call that exceeds the bounds of the stack buffer, triggering the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege:** The attacker requires low privilege to initiate the communication with the driver via the escape call.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine to be able to interact with the driver.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content is more detailed than the standard CVE description as it specifies the exact escape code (`0x15002a`) that triggers the vulnerability.
* The content also specifies the affected product as AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10.
