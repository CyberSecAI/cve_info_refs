- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Baxter Spectrum Wireless Battery Module (WBM) operates a Telnet service with hard-coded credentials when connected to specific SSIDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure, alteration of system configurations, or impact to system availability. The impact is rated as High for Availability, and Low for Confidentiality and Integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected device, connected to a specific SSID where the Telnet service with hardcoded credentials is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the affected device, meaning they would need to be on the same network or have the capability to access the network where the WBM is connected. No user interaction is required.
