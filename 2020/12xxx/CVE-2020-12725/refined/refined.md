Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12725:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the "JSON" data source of Redash. The application attempts to restrict requests to internal addresses but can be bypassed using HTTP redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF:** The application allows making requests to arbitrary URLs specified by the user, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application attempts to block requests to private IP addresses using a check within the `is_private_address` function. This check can be bypassed through HTTP redirects, demonstrating a flaw in input validation logic

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can use the vulnerable Redash instance to probe internal network resources, access internal services or gather information about internal infrastructure. This includes the possibility of accessing services running on the same host as the Redash application
- **Data Exfiltration:** Depending on the internal services accessible, sensitive information such as AWS metadata can be obtained. The severity of data exfiltration depends on the specificity of the targeted internal systems.
- **Pivoting/Persistence:** By leveraging the flexibility of the JSON data source, the attacker can establish a foothold within the internal network to expand the attack to other systems or maintain persistence.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Redirects:** The primary attack vector is using HTTP redirects to bypass the private IP address check. An attacker crafts a URL that redirects to an internal address.
- **JSON Data Source:** The vulnerable component is the "JSON" data source in Redash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Redash instance to create a data source and perform queries.
- **Access to JSON Data Source:** The attacker requires the ability to create and use a "JSON" type data source.
