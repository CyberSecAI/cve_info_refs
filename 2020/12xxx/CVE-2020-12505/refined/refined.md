- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in the Web-Based Management (WBM) of WAGO programmable logic controllers (PLCs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is categorized as "Improper Authentication" (CWE-287), which allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can send specially crafted requests to modify certain parameters without authentication. This can prevent the device from loading the runtime application after a restart, leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the network, exploiting the web-based management interface (WBM).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the WBM of the affected WAGO PLC.
