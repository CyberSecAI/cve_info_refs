  "CVE-2020-12423": {
    "Description": "When the Windows DLL \"webauthn.dll\" was missing from the Operating System, and a malicious one was placed in a folder in the user's %PATH%, Firefox may have loaded the DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution. *Note: This issue only affects the Windows operating system; other operating systems are unaffected.*",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Firefox was not loading the webauthn.dll from a specific system path. Instead it was searching for it in the system %PATH% directories, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking if a malicious DLL was placed there.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "DLL Hijacking"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious DLL is placed in a folder in the user's %PATH%.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have write access to a folder in the user's %PATH% environment variable to place the malicious DLL."
