#### Last update

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1046008 | PLCnext Engineer | <= 2020.3.1 |

#### Summary

The build settings of a PLCnext Engineer project (.pcwex) can be manipulated in a way that can result in the execution of remote code.
The attacker needs to get access to a PLCnext Engineer project to be able to manipulate files inside. Additionally, the files of the remote code need to be transferred to a location which can be accessed by the PC that runs PLCnext Engineer. When PLCnext Engineer runs a build process of the manipulated project the remote code can be executed.

importing project files from unknown source and exchange or store project files together with a
checksum to ensure their integrity.
