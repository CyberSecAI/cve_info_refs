- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper path sanitization during the import of project files in PLCnext Engineer. Specifically, the build settings of a project file (.pcwex) can be manipulated to include paths to arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal (CWE-22). The software does not properly restrict the paths that can be specified in the project files, allowing an attacker to include paths outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Execution of arbitrary code. An attacker can manipulate a project file to execute remote code when the project is built in PLCnext Engineer, potentially compromising the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of the engineering workstation.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs access to a PLCnext Engineer project file (.pcwex) to modify it.
    - The attacker needs to transfer the malicious remote code to a location accessible by the machine running PLCnext Engineer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the .pcwex project file.
    - The attacker needs to have a way to get the malicious code onto a location accessible by the workstation running PLCnext Engineer.
    - The user of PLCnext Engineer needs to import the malicious project file for the vulnerability to be exploited.
