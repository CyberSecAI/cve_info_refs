OpenSSL Security Advisory [09 September 2020]
=============================================
Raccoon Attack (CVE-2020-1968)
==============================
Severity: Low
The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to
an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which
have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would
result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications
sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an
implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that
this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue: it never reuses a DH secret and
does not implement any "static" DH ciphersuites.
OpenSSL 1.0.2f and above will only reuse a DH secret if a "static" DH
ciphersuite is used. These static "DH" ciphersuites are ones that start with the
text "DH-" (for example "DH-RSA-AES256-SHA"). The standard IANA names for these
ciphersuites all start with "TLS\_DH\_" but excludes those that start with
"TLS\_DH\_anon\_".
OpenSSL 1.0.2e and below would reuse the DH secret across multiple TLS
connections in server processes unless the SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE option was
explicitly configured. Therefore all ciphersuites that use DH in servers
(including ephemeral DH) are vulnerable in these versions. In OpenSSL 1.0.2f
SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE was made the default and it could not be turned off as a
response to CVE-2016-0701.
Since the vulnerability lies in the TLS specification, fixing the affected
ciphersuites is not viable. For this reason 1.0.2w moves the affected
ciphersuites into the "weak-ssl-ciphers" list. Support for the
"weak-ssl-ciphers" is not compiled in by default. This is unlikely to cause
interoperability problems in most cases since use of these ciphersuites is rare.
Support for the "weak-ssl-ciphers" can be added back by configuring OpenSSL at
compile time with the "enable-weak-ssl-ciphers" option. This is not recommended.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates.
Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2w. If
upgrading is not viable then users of OpenSSL 1.0.2v or below should ensure
that affected ciphersuites are disabled through runtime configuration. Also
note that the affected ciphersuites are only available on the server side if a
DH certificate has been configured. These certificates are very rarely used and
for this reason this issue has been classified as LOW severity.
This issue was found by Robert Merget, Marcus Brinkmann, Nimrod Aviram and Juraj
Somorovsky and reported to OpenSSL on 28th May 2020 under embargo in order to
allow co-ordinated disclosure with other implementations.
Note
====
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended
support is available for premium support customers:
https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html
OpenSSL 1.1.0 is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind.
The impact of this issue on OpenSSL 1.1.0 has not been analysed.
Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1.

over time.

# Raccoon Attack

* [Paper](#paper)
* [Q&A](#question-answer)

Raccoon is a timing vulnerability in the TLS **specification** that affects HTTPS and
other services that rely on SSL and TLS. These protocols
allow everyone on the Internet to browse the web, use email,
shop online, and send instant messages without third-parties
being able to read the communication.

Raccoon allows attackers under certain conditions to break the encryption and read
sensitive communications.
The vulnerability is really hard to exploit and relies on very precise timing measurements and on a specific server configuration to be exploitable.

## Attack Overview

Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange is a well-established method for exchanging keys in TLS connections.
When using Diffie-Hellman, both TLS peers generate private keys at random (a and b) and compute their public keys:
ga mod p and gb mod p.
These public keys are sent in the TLS KeyExchange messages.
Once both keys are received, both the client and server can compute a shared key *gab mod p*
- called *premaster secret* -
which is used to derive all TLS session keys with a specific *key derivation function*.

Our Raccoon attack exploits a TLS specification side channel; TLS 1.2 (and all previous versions) prescribes that all leading zero bytes in the premaster secret are [stripped before used in further computations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-8.1.2). Since the resulting premaster secret is used as an input into the key derivation function, which is based on hash functions with different timing profiles, precise timing measurements may enable an attacker to construct an oracle from a TLS server. This oracle tells the attacker whether a computed premaster secret starts with zero or not. For example, the attacker could eavesdrop ga sent by the client, resend it to the server, and determine whether the resulting premaster secret starts with zero or not.

Learning one byte from a premaster secret would not help the attacker much. However, here the attack gets interesting. Imagine the attacker intercepted a ClientKeyExchange message containing the value ga. The attacker can now construct values related to ga and send them to the server in distinct TLS handshakes. More concretely, the attacker constructs values gri\*ga, which lead to premaster secrets gri\*b\*gab. Based on the server timing behavior, the attacker can find values leading to premaster secrets starting with zero. In the end, this helps the attacker to construct a set of equations and use a solver for the Hidden Number Problem (HNP) to compute the original premaster secret established between the client and the server.

[Raccoon Attack:
Finding and Exploiting Most-Significant-Bit-Oracles in TLS-DH(E)](RacoonAttack.pdf).
Robert Merget, Marcus Brinkmann, Nimrod Aviram, Juraj Somorovsky,
Johannes Mittmann, and Jörg Schwenk.

## FAQ

### I am an admin, should I drop everything and fix this?

Probably not. Raccoon is a complex timing attack and it is very hard to exploit. It requires a lot of stars to align to decrypt a real-world TLS session. There are, however, [exceptions](#f5).
### What can the attackers gain?

In the case the (rare) circumstances are met,
Raccoon allows an attacker to decrypt the connection between users and the server. This
typically includes, but is not limited to, usernames and
passwords, credit card numbers, emails, instant messages, and
sensitive documents.

### Who is vulnerable?

The attack generally targets the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in TLS 1.2 and below. There are two prerequisites for the attack:

* The server reuses public DH keys in the TLS handshake. This is the case if the server is configured to use static TLS-DH cipher suites, or if the server uses ephemeral cipher suites (TLS-DHE) and [reuses ephemeral keys](#reuse) for multiple connections. Luckily, this was already considered bad practice before the attack, as it does not provide forward secrecy.
* The attacker can execute precise timing measurements, which allow him/her to find out whether the first byte of the DH shared secret starts with zero or not.

### So how practical is the attack?

That is an excellent question that probably does not have a satisfying answer.
Cryptographic(!) attacks against TLS generally tend to be not used a lot by real-world attackers as far as we know.
The attacker needs particular circumstances for the Raccoon attack to work.
He needs to be close to the target server to perform high precision timing measurements.
He needs the victim connection to use DH(E) and the server to reuse ephemeral keys.
And finally, the attacker needs to observe the original connection.
For a real attacker, this is a lot to ask for.
However, in comparison to what an attacker would need to do to break modern cryptographic primitives like AES,
the attack does not look complex anymore.
But still, a real-world attacker will probably use other attack vectors that are simpler and more reliable than this attack.

### Is my website vulnerable?

It might be. You can check this using tools like:

* [www.ssllabs.com](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/), your server might be vulnerable if "DH public server param (Ys) reuse" says "yes".
* We will release our own tool very soon.

### Is my browser/client vulnerable?

The vulnerability is not really a client-side vulnerability.
The client can do nothing about this, except not to support DH(E) cipher suites.
Modern browsers should not support these cipher suites anymore.
As far as we know, Firefox was the last major browser that supported DHE,
and dropped support for it in [Firefox 78](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/78.0/releasenotes/) in June 2020 (by now, most clients should run at least that version, if not later versions).
You can check if your browser still supports DH(E) [here](https://clienttest.ssllabs.com:8443/ssltest/viewMyClient.html),
but to reiterate, there is nothing practical clients can or should do about the attack.

### Does Raccoon allow you to steal the private key?

No, you have to perform the attack for each individual connection you want to attack.

### Is TLS 1.3 also affected?

No. In TLS 1.3, the leading zero bytes are preserved for DHE cipher suites (as well as for ECDHE ones) and keys should not be reused.
However, there exists a variant of TLS 1.3, which explicitly allows key reuse (or even encourages it),
called [ETS or eTLS](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103500_103599/10352303/01.01.01_60/ts_10352303v010101p.pdf).
If ephemeral keys get reused in either variant, they could lead to micro-architectural side channels,
which could be exploited, although leading zero bytes are preserved.
We recommend not using these variants.

### Is ECDH also affected?

Generally no. In TLS, the PMS's leading zero bytes are preserved in all versions of TLS for ECDH.
So a secure, leak-free implementation should be possible.
In other protocols, this might not be the case.
To the best of our knowledge, even if side channels were present,
the best currently known algorithms still require a lot more known bits to work for ECDH than what is possible to get with Raccoon. We still want to point out that the ECDH variant of the HNP has not been studied as extensively as the traditional HNP. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that future improvements to these algorithms might also make these attacks work for ECDH.

### Is DTLS affected?

Yes.

### So is this really only a timing vulnerability?

Sadly no. A bug in your software can also make this attack possible without timing measurements.
We performed a large-scale Internet scan to analyze a large variety of TLS servers and found - surprise -
several devices showing different behavior resulting from the first byte of the premaster secret.
So far, we were able to identify and report one of them: an older version of F5 BIG-IP.
You should probably check that you are not running a vulnerable configuration
(see [CVE-2020-5929](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K91158923))
since this allows mounting a direct attack without complex timing measurements.
If you are running a vulnerable configuration, you should probably patch now.
Note that, also in the case of the vulnerable F5 BIG-IP, the attack is only practical if the server reuses DH public keys.
We recommend not dismissing the ability of the attacker to measure precise timing, and instead move away from DHE for
clients and avoid key reuse for servers.

### How common is DHE key reuse?

We performed a measurement across the Alexa Top 100k websites on the Internet.
3.33% of those servers reused their ephemeral DH keys at least once.
 [Springall et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2987443.2987480)
found that 4.4% of the Alexa Top 1M reused DH keys, as of 2016.

### Since when does the vulnerability exist?

The vulnerability was undiscovered for more than 20 years (at least since SSLv3, published in 1996).
The flaw was fixed for TLS 1.3 in [draft-14](https://github.com/tlswg/tls13-spec/pull/462),
thanks to David Benjamin from Google who flagged this issue.

### Why wasn't this discovered earlier?

The attack combines a lot of details of the involved primitives.
The [Hidden Number Problem (HNP)](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/dhmsb.html),
which we ultimately use to exploit the timing side channel,
has never been used to exploit its original target (the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange).
That is because no one knew a technique to get the most significant bits of a Diffie-Hellman shared secret.
Since then, the HNP was mostly used in other settings like DSA or ECDSA,
and the knowledge that it also works for DH got forgotten.
The fact that the leading zeros in the TLS-DH(E) premaster secrets are stripped is also a TLS detail that probably only a few people knew of.

### Why does TLS-DH(E) strip leading zero bytes in the first place?

We found the answer to this question in an old [Bugzilla entry](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=291498).
It seems like SSL 3 was supposed to implement PKCS#3, which mandates that leading zero bits of the PMS are preserved.
But implementors misunderstood the wording in the spec of SSL 3:

> *A conventional Diffie-Hellman computation is performed. The
> negotiated key (Z) is used as the pre\_master\_secret [...].*

Instead, leading zero bytes were stripped. By the time this was discovered, the damage was already done.
For TLS 1.0, it was then intentionally changed to remove leading zero bytes, probably to avoid further confusion.
When elliptic curves were later added to the standard,
they explicitly mentioned that the leading zeros of the PMS have to be preserved,
resulting in the current situation where they are preserved for ECDH but not for DH.

### Why is the attack called "Raccoon"?

Raccoon is not an acronym.
Raccoons are just cute animals, and it is well past time that an attack will be named after them :)

### How have vendors responded to this vulnerability?

* F5 assigned the issue [CVE-2020-5929](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5929).
  In particular, several F5 products allow executing a special version of the attack, without the need
  for precise timing measurements. F5 recommends their customers to patch the products or to enforce usage of fresh ephemeral keys.
  Please refer to the [F5 Security Advisory](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K91158923).
* OpenSSL assigned the issue [CVE-2020-1968](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1968).
  OpenSSL does use fresh DH keys per default since version 1.0.2f (which made SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE default as a response to CVE-2016-0701). Therefore, the attack mainly affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 when a DH certificate is in use, which is rare. OpenSSL 1.1.1 never reuses a DH secret and does not implement any "static" DH ciphersuites.
  To mitigate the attack, the developers moved all remaining DH cipher suites into the "weak-ssl-ciphers" list. In addition, motivated by this research, the developers also activated the fresh generation of EC ephemeral keys in OpenSSL 1.0.2w.
  Please refer to the
  [OpenSSL Security Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20200909.txt).
* Mozilla assigned the issue [CVE-2020-12413](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12413).
  It has been solved by disabling DH and DHE cipher suites in Firefox
  (which was already planned before the Raccoon disclosure).
* Microsoft assigned the issue [CVE-2020-1596](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1596). Please refer to the [Microsoft Security Response Center portal](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1596).

BearSSL and BoringSSL are not affected because they do not support DH(E) cipher suites.
GnuTLS, Wolfssl, Botan, Mbed TLS and s2n do not support static DH cipher suites. Their DHE cipher suites never reuse ephemeral keys.

### I thought there was a security proof for TLS-DH(E) ([here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/219.pdf) and [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/182.pdf)). Why wasn't this covered by the proof?

A problem with a lot of current cryptographic proof techniques is that they are often **not designed to model side channels**
(within the protocol). They will assume that all operations are always executed in constant time,
although this might be impossible to achieve in practice.
Additionally, they do not model the encoding of secrets within the primitives.
These details get lost in the proven model of the protocol.
To prove that TLS-DH(E) is secure, the PRF-ODH assumption had to be introduced,
and the proof relied on this assumption to hold for TLS.
In theory, this assumption is still fine for TLS, but for all practical means, the assumption does not hold in real TLS implementations.

### How is this attack related to other TLS attacks?

Many of you would probably remember [Bleichenbacher's attack](http://archiv.infsec.ethz.ch/education/fs08/secsem/bleichenbacher98.pdf) (see also [ROBOT](https://robotattack.org) for practical exploits). This adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack exploits server behavior differences by processing RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 messages. It allows the attacker to decrypt the premaster secret after a few thousands of connections. From the attacker model perspective, the Raccoon attack is very similar to Bleichenbacher's attack; the attacker also needs to send several modified ClientKeyExchange messages to the server, observe its responses, and perform some cryptographic computations to reveal the premaster secret. In contrast to Bleichenbacher's attack, Raccoon targets the DH key exchange.

Lucky 13 is another cool attack you might have in mind when reading the description of the Raccoon attack. In Lucky 13, AlFardan and Paterson exploited different timing behaviors of HMACs computed over different TLS record lengths. This allowed them to distinguish valid from invalid paddings and apply CBC padding oracle attacks. The attack works in a [BEAST attack scenario](https://nerdoholic.org/uploads/dergln/beast_part2/ssl_jun21.pdf) and allows the attacker to decrypt TLS records. In contrast, our Raccoon attack exploits the timing behavior difference resulting from the HMAC computations over premaster secrets of different lengths. It reveals the premaster secret and thus decrypts the whole connection based on a single eavesdropped ClientKeyExchange message. Our Raccoon attack was inspired by the Lucky 13 side channel.

### What about other protocols?

As you may imagine, there are many protocols using DH key exchange. For example, we can confirm that SSH does also strip leading zero bits.
However, according to [Springall et. al](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2017/cmsc818O/papers/crypto-shortcuts.pdf)
SSH does a better job at avoiding key reuse than TLS did, and therefore the attack is not exploitable in SSH.

[XML Encryption](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core1/#sec-DHKeyAgreement) and [IPsec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5996#section-2.14) preserve leading zero bytes.

JSON Web Encryption only offers ECDH key agreement. The established shared secret should be processed as described in the [NIST Special Publication 800-56A](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/final). This document recommends to preserve leading zero bytes, see Appendix C.1 and C.2.

There are many other protocols using DH key exchange. Their analysis is often hard since the documents do not provide information how to handle established shared secrets so that source code analysis or manual tests are necessary. It would also be interesting to see whether similar Raccoon-styled attacks would be applicable to the newest post quantum schemes.

### So is a protocol, which preserves leading zero bytes in the DH shared secret, completely secure against this attack?

Our main attack relies on the TLS specification problem resulting from the stripped zeros.
Executing a key derivation function over premaster secrets of different lengths leads to different timing behaviors.
This is the side channel that showed to perform well in our measurements.

However, it is very likely that even if the shared secret preserves leading zero bytes, there could arise different side channels allowing the attacker to mount such an attack.
Implementing a constant-time computation is very challenging; the side channel can arrise from the underlying big number library implementation or aligning shared secret to the modulus length.
While such side channels are not as significant as the side channel described in our paper, a stronger attacker could still use powerful techniques like micro-architectural attacks to find out whether computed shared secrets start with zero or not.

### Is this vulnerability really serious enough to deserve a name, a logo and a web page?

It is a vulnerability in the TLS specification, so we think...yes. In addition, it was fun to create them :)

This e-mail was sent to security@mozilla.org this morning (CEST):

Dear Mozilla Security Team,

We are writing to inform you about a new timing side-channel attack in

the TLS *specification* we call "raccoon attack".

Please forward this report to the person responsible for TLS (NSS) in

your company.

Please treat this report as confidential, since we are trying to

coordinate the disclosure of this finding.

Since the vulnerability is present in the standard, it may well be

applicable to most implementations, but we did not check whether your

implementation specifically is vulnerable to this attack. The best way

for you to determine whether it is vulnerable is to consult your

developers responsible for TLS.

Your implementation is probably affected if one of the following

applies:

* It supports TLS\_DH\_ cipher suites
* It supports TLS\_DHE\_ cipher suites and it is possible to reuse

  ephemeral public keys.
* It supports TLS\_DHE\_PSK cipher suites (a weaker form of the attack)

If none of these applies to your implementation, it is probably not

vulnerable and you can treat this report as a friendly heads up :).

**Vulnerability Details**

The core problem within the TLS specification is that for DH(E) the

computed PreMasterSecret (PMS) is supposed to be stripped from leading

zero bytes. This results in the PMS being sometimes longer, and

sometimes a little shorter. But since the PMS is then used to derive the

MasterSecret (MS), multiple potential side channels may arise that leak

the leading bits of the computed PMS. These leading bits can then be

used to compute the PMS if the same public Diffie-Hellman value is used

for multiple connections.

**Potential side channel 1: Hash function block border**

The PRF used to derive the MS is using HMAC internally with the PMS as

the key. If the PMS is longer than the block size of the hash function

within the HMAC (eg. 512 bit for SHA1, SHA256, or 1024 bit for SHA384),

the PMS has to be hashed before it is used as the HMAC key. Hashing of

inputs of different sizes is inherently not a constant time operation.

Whether the PMS reaches the block size obviously depends on the used

modulo. For standard size moduli (1024, 2048, 4096) it is not possible

to reach the block border of hash functions this way. We attached a list

of dangerous moduli sizes. If you are using a vulnerable moduli size, we

experimentally confirmed that the side channel is big enough such that

the attack can be executed over LAN.

**Potential side channel 2: Hash function padding**

Initially, we thought that this just becomes an issue if the PMS is

close to the block size of the hash function (hashing one block vs

hashing two blocks), but experiments showed that a lot of

implementations are also not constant time within a single block. We

attribute this to internal copy operations or the adding of padding

within the hash function. We believe that this kind of side channel is

usually only exploitable in a co-located setup.

**Potential side-channel 3: HMAC key padding**

If the PMS is smaller than the block size of the hash function, the key

has to be padded to the hash function size. This can also create a

timing side channel.

**Potential side channel 4: DHE\_PSK**

For DHE\_PSK the PMS is constructed differently. Instead of using the

PMS from the Diffie-Hellman computation directly, the PMS is constructed

as:

PMS\* = Length | PMS | Length | PSK

This results in a change of the length of the PMS\* which is fed into

the hash function. For some PSK lengths, this can leak the length of the

PSK, even if the public DH value of the server is not reused. More

dramatically, if the attacker is a legitimate user and can choose a PSK

for his own account, he can use this to guarantee that PMS\* always gets

close to the critical block border.

**Potential side channel 5: Direct answers**

We saw that some implementations do not require a timing side channel

for exploitation at all since they behave differently if the PMS starts

with a zero byte (e.g., by sending an alert message). This is a bug in

itself, since this means that a fraction of the TLS connections fail

even if no attacker is present. With this bug, the vulnerability is

exploitable by simply observing server responses, without the need for

accurate timing measurements.

**Remediation**

This is an issue in the TLS specification. Without special care of the

handling of the PMS the side channel will be present. We recommend not

reusing the ephemeral public keys. This leaves the core of the

vulnerability open but makes it not exploitable. Last but not least we

recommend making sure the key derivation runs in constant time even if

the PMS has varying size. To do this, similar techniques as for Lucky13

mitigation can be applied.

**Attack Explanation**

A sophisticated attacker may be able to exploit this timing behavior as

follows: The attacker intercepts a (DH) CKE message (g^a mod p) for

which he wants to decrypt a session. The attacker then starts a lot of

connections on his own, where he sends his public key as g^a \* g^s

mod p for arbitrary values of s, followed by a CCS and an invalid

finished message. The server then computes the PMS as g^ab \* g^sb mod

p. The attacker measures the time it took for the implementation to

respond to the invalid finished message. He then tries to identify the

handshakes for which g^ab \* g^sb resulted in a PMS with at least one

leading zero byte by looking at the execution time. The attacker can

construct and solve an instance of the Hidden Number Problem to recover

g^ab (for example using common techniques to find the shortest vector

in a lattice) and decrypt the targeted session.

Note that for some moduli this setup does not leak a single byte, but

might leak more than one byte. For example, for a 1036 bit modulus, we

can measure the block borders for SHA384 with a 12-bit leak. In this

specific case, the attacker needs to collect roughly 107 equations with

2^12 \* 107 ~= 439000 connections (assuming perfect timing

measurements), and can then recover the shared secret of a past session

in under 20 minutes using lattice techniques.

For the important case of an 8-bit leak, the lattice techniques we used

were not successful with our modest computational power. It probably

requires a lot more measurements and intensive computational efforts.

However, an attacker can always continue measuring until he gets

equations that leak more than the top 8 bits. It is also possible that

other techniques to solve the hidden number problem (besides lattices)

can be applied to improve the result.

**ECDH(E)**

ECDH(E) is not directly affected by this issue, as in ECDH(E) the PMS is

always padded with zero bytes. Note that this padding might introduce

another side channel that will leak the top bits of the PMS again. We

have not yet investigated whether this potential leak can be exploited.

**FF-DHE TLS 1.3**

TLS 1.3 preserves the leading zero bytes of the shared secret. If a

potential padding of the shared secret does not introduce a timing

side-channel, the attack is not applicable to TLS 1.3 directly. However,

if the public DH value of a TLS 1.3 session is shared with TLS 1.2

session the attack becomes possible again.

**Disclosure Timeline**

As you can imagine, a lot of different people have to deal with this

issue currently. We want to coordinate the disclosure such that everyone

gets an appropriate time to respond to this issue. We plan to submit our

research to USENIX Security 2021 (in roughly 3 weeks), but we will

commit to not make our research publicly available before September 1st

2020. We would appreciate it if you would also keep this report

confidential until then.

**Additional Information**

If you need additional help with this report or require additional

clarification, feel free to contact us.

If you think this report applies to your library and you take measures

to mitigate it, we would appreciate hearing from you about the actions

you have taken.

Dear Robert, Marcus, Nimrod and Juraj,

Thank you so much for sending this through, we truly appreciate it. To confirm, the crux of the attack is to find, using one of the possible timing side channels, an attacker-constructed handshake that results in a PMS with a leading zero byte, and then solving for the HNP produces g^{ab}, the targeted PMS. Is this right?

As you've stated, with a single byte of leakage this attack is difficult to mount successfully from a modest computational power perspective. What do you mean by 'modest' here? Do you have estimates on how much computational power would be required for the single-byte-leakage case to succeed? Also, to use side channel 1, the hash function block border, it seems you need to be using a dangerous modulus size, i.e., non-standard, correct? And in the DHE case, ephemerals have to be reused.

From a Firefox perspective, support for DHE ciphersuites has, independent of your news, been marked for removal in the short-term. We will, however, discuss your findings within the team to determine what NSS components and consumers might be affected.

We appreciate that you've respected a 90-day public disclosure window. The disclosure to potential USENIX reviewers, however, is set to happen within a much tighter time frame. Typically, I imagine that reviewers will respect any disclosure boundaries but we will also discuss this further within the team.

Thank you again for reaching out to us, and for your very detailed report. We hope to be in touch soon.

Best wishes,

Thyla

Dear Thyla, thank you for the prompt response.

> To confirm, the crux of the attack is to find, using one of the possible timing side channels, an attacker-constructed handshake that results in a PMS with a leading zero byte, and then solving for the HNP produces g^{ab}, the targeted PMS. Is this right?

Correct. We note the attacker will have to collect many handshakes (~100 handshakes) that result in a PMS with a leading zero byte, and then feed those as input to the HNP.

> What do you mean by 'modest' here?

We used 64 cores.

> Do you have estimates on how much computational power would be required for the single-byte-leakage case to succeed?

Unfortunately no. We used the above 64 cores for many hours, trying several settings for the HNP solver, but it seems we were not even close for 1024-bit modoli. However, 768-bit modulo with a single byte leakage is feasible with our computational power. For 1024 bit moduli, we also could not provide any estimates by extrapolating from cases we could solve.

> Also, to use side channel 1, the hash function block border, it seems you need to be using a dangerous modulus size, i.e., non-standard, correct?

Correct.

> And in the DHE case, ephemerals have to be reused.

Correct.

> The disclosure to potential USENIX reviewers, however, is set to happen within a much tighter time frame. Typically, I imagine that reviewers will respect any disclosure boundaries but we will also discuss this further within the team.

We imagine the concern is that reviewers might break the embargo, but we did not experience any problems with this in past projects. Please do let us know if this is a concern for you.

thank you again, best wishes,

Thanks for the clarification a while back, Nimrod, appreciated! Regarding your submission to USENIX, we don't see a problem with this. I imagine that you'll be stating in the paper, to reviewers, that you're observing responsible disclose and hence they will know that it's not public yet?

Hey, we saw that you were moving the deprecation of DHE forward. Since we are writing a scientific paper, it would be good to know if this finding influenced the decision to deprecate DHE or if this is just a coincidence. Can you update us on that?

This was already on our roadmap, and was going to be tackled by the team soon for Firefox, as stated in my first comment. So, the decision to deprecate DHE was already made and we would have moved forward with it regardless but perhaps now we're moving forward one or two Firefox cycles sooner. Again, we are very grateful for your responsible disclosure of what you've found, and the process that you have followed, we truly appreciate it.

Hi Folks,

Following your earlier question about the single-byte-leakage case: We have now managed to solve this case.

For the RFC 5114 1024-bit modulo with a single byte leakage, we succeeded in solving the HNP in roughly 2.5 hours with a single CPU core.

We also attach a draft of our paper under submission; Table 3 (on page 12) summarizes the HNP instances we could solve.

(Times in the table are always using a single CPU core.)

best,

Hi Mozilla Folks,

Based on discussions with other vendors who are impacted more seriously by this issue, we have moved our own public disclosure date to September 9th.

Some vendors may release patches or disclose this issue on the original date we suggested, September 1st.

Obviously, it is fine with us if you'd like to do so. If you are planing to reference the attack, we would kindly ask you to postpone describing the full attack details to the 9th of September.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):
