Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12413:

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-12413 is assigned to the Raccoon Attack vulnerability as it affects Mozilla Firefox. The root cause is a timing side-channel vulnerability in the TLS specification related to how Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange is handled. This vulnerability is not specific to Firefox but affects other TLS implementations as well, depending on how they handle DH and DHE ciphersuites.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the TLS specification that dictates that leading zero bytes in the pre-master secret (PMS), when using DH(E) key exchange, should be stripped before being used in further computations. This leads to the PMS having a variable length depending on the randomness of the generated secret. The resulting varying length of the PMS introduces timing side-channels in the key derivation process. These timing variations can be measured by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Timing Side-Channel:** The core vulnerability lies in the timing differences caused by the variable length of the PMS. The key derivation function, based on hash functions, exhibits different timing profiles based on the length of input, especially around the block boundaries of hash functions.
2. **DH Key Reuse:** The attack becomes practical when the DH public keys are reused between multiple TLS connections. This includes using static DH ciphersuites (e.g., "DH-RSA-AES256-SHA") or reusing ephemeral keys in DHE ciphersuites.
3.  **Vulnerable Moduli Sizes:** Specific modulus sizes can exacerbate the timing side-channel by allowing the PMS to reach block boundaries of the hash functions used in key derivation, leading to more pronounced timing differences.
4.  **DHE_PSK Vulnerability**: When using DHE_PSK, the PMS is constructed differently by concatenating length, PMS, length, and PSK which introduces a different side channel related to the PSK length which can be controlled by an attacker.
5.  **Implementation Bugs**: Some implementations exhibit non-constant time behavior in the hash function, padding operations or key padding, regardless of input length. In some cases, a server might exhibit a different behavior based on if the PMS starts with a zero byte, exposing a direct attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:

1.  **Decrypt TLS Sessions:** By measuring timing differences, the attacker can construct an oracle that reveals whether a computed PMS starts with zero or not. By exploiting this oracle for a large number of handshakes, the attacker can recover the original PMS established between the client and the server.
2.  **Eavesdrop on Encrypted Communications:** Once the PMS is obtained, all encrypted communication sent over the TLS connection can be decrypted. This includes sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, emails, instant messages, and sensitive documents.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or Eavesdropping:** The attacker needs to intercept and modify TLS handshakes between a client and server and measure the timing of responses.
2.  **Precise Timing Measurements:** The attacker must be able to make precise timing measurements of the server's responses to crafted TLS handshakes. The attacker needs to be close to the target server to perform high precision timing measurements.
3.  **Server Misconfiguration:** The server needs to be configured to use static DH ciphersuites or reuse ephemeral keys for multiple connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept TLS traffic between a client and server.
2.  **Timing Capability:** The attacker must be able to perform precise timing measurements of the server's responses.
3.  **Knowledge of Cryptography:** The attacker needs to understand the underlying principles of the Hidden Number Problem (HNP) and its application to DH.
4.  **Computational Resources:** Although a single-byte leakage can be exploited with a single CPU core within a few hours, more significant leakages require more computational power.
5. **Exploitable Implementation:** The attacker needs a vulnerable server, where the timing side-channel is exposed and/or the server exhibits bugs leading to direct exploitation without timing measurements.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects TLS 1.2 and earlier versions. TLS 1.3 addresses the issue by preserving leading zero bytes in DHE cipher suites.
*   The Raccoon attack is considered difficult to exploit in practice but still represents a security risk.
*   Mitigation primarily focuses on avoiding DH key reuse and disabling vulnerable ciphersuites. Mozilla fixed this by disabling DH and DHE cipher suites in Firefox.
*   The vulnerability was found to be present in the TLS specification and has existed for more than 20 years.
