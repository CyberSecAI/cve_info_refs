{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2020-12866",
  "description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `epsonds_net_read` function within SANE Backends. This flaw allows a malicious device on the same local network to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
  "affected_component": "SANE Backends",
  "root_cause": "The `epsonds_net_read` function does not properly handle responses with unexpected sizes. Specifically, when `size != wanted`,  it accesses `s->netbuf` without verifying if `s->netbuf` is initialized which may lead to a null pointer dereference.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Null pointer dereference"
  ],
  "impact": "Remote denial of service (DoS). An attacker can cause the application using SANE backends to crash, making the application unusable.",
   "attack_vector": "A malicious device connected to the same local network as the victim",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a device on the same local network as the victim and needs to be able to send network packets to the victim's machine.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is triggered when an application such as `simple-scan` searches the network for scanners. The crash occurs as soon as `simple-scan` starts. This issue is also referred to as GHSL-2020-079"
