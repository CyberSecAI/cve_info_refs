## Description

![@humblelad](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30574278?u=17e9124d76daf5db7efd32ed77922e4d0196e1da&v=4&size=48)[humblelad](https://github.com/humblelad)opened [on Apr 19, 2020](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues/5266#issue-602803937)

**Describe the bug**

*This vulnerability can potentially enable any student to takeover the account of TA if they open the attachment as the cookie gets exposed.*

A student logged in via username/password student:student has the ability to submit submissions for grading.

This can be then viewed by TA from their account via ta:ta . When they click on the file for grading, stored xss gets triggered.

**Expected behavior**

.svg files must be stopped from getting uploaded by any student during submissions.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. As student login, via student:student
2. Go here <http://localhost:1501/s20/tutorial/gradeable/01_simple_python> (as ex.)
3. In the new submission upload the .svg file.

   The svg file can be created by saving as .svg

   Github doesn't allow attaching svg and neither its code so here is the [link](http://ghostlulz.com/xss-svg/) to create a sample malicious svg file.
4. Login as ta and open the same for grading. The XSS gets triggered alerting the cookies.

**Additional context**

We may try to block .svg files from uploading and also try to drop the Content-Type: image/svg+xml.

Adding content-disposition: attachment as mentioned [here](https://svg.digi.ninja/svg) may help for the mitigation.
