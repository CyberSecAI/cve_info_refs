Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of uploaded files, specifically SVG files. The system allows students to upload SVG files, which can contain malicious JavaScript code. When a TA (Teaching Assistant) views the uploaded SVG file, this embedded JavaScript is executed within the TA's browser session, resulting in a stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code is stored within a file uploaded by a student, which is then executed in the context of the TA's session when they access the file.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application does not validate the content of uploaded files, allowing the upload of potentially harmful SVG files.
*   **Missing Content Security Measures:**  The application does not properly set `Content-Disposition: attachment` to prevent SVGs from being rendered in the browser, and does not sanitize the file content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** The primary impact described is the potential for a student to gain control of a TA's account. By exploiting the stored XSS vulnerability, the malicious JavaScript code can steal the TA's cookies (session information), which can then be used to impersonate the TA.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  Beyond account takeover, the attacker could potentially use the compromised TA session to steal sensitive data or perform actions within the application on the behalf of the TA.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File upload:** A student uploads a malicious .svg file as part of a submission.
*   **Viewing uploaded files:** When a TA accesses the uploaded file for grading, the stored XSS is triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated Student:** The attacker needs to have an account with student privileges on the application to upload the malicious .svg file.
*   **Victim is TA:** The victim needs to be a TA using the system, who will view the student's submissions to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided content includes a link to a resource for creating a sample malicious SVG file.
*   The suggested mitigation includes blocking SVG uploads, dropping the `Content-Type: image/svg+xml` header, and adding `content-disposition: attachment` to make the browser download the file instead of rendering it.
