- **Root Cause:**
    - The vulnerability stems from a lack of nested page table protection in AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) and SEV-ES features. This allows a malicious hypervisor to potentially manipulate the guest's memory and execute arbitrary code within the guest VM.
    - Additionally, the attestation mechanism in SEV/SEV-ES does not detect memory re-arrangements in the guest address space, which can be exploited by a malicious hypervisor to achieve arbitrary code execution within the guest.

- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Lack of nested page table protection in SEV/SEV-ES.
    - Permutation-agnostic remote attestation in SEV/SEV-ES.

- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary code execution within the guest virtual machine.

- **Attack Vectors:**
    - A malicious hypervisor administrator.

- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - Access to the server hypervisor with administrative privileges.

- **Additional Details:**
    - The vulnerability is described in two research papers, "SEVerity: Code Injection Attacks against Encrypted Virtual Machines" and "undeSErVed trust: Exploiting Permutation-Agnostic Remote Attestation".
    - The vulnerability is mitigated in the SEV-SNP feature, available in 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, which includes integrity protection.
    - Prior generations of EPYC processors are vulnerable and require security best practices to minimize risk.
