Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12676:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `compass-security.com`, `seclists.org` and `github.com` directly references **CVE-2020-12676** and describes a vulnerability in the `fusionauth-samlv2` library. This confirms the relevance of the content to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw in the `verifySignature` method of the `fusionauth-samlv2` library. The method checks for the presence of a `<Signature>` element in a SAML message. If the element is missing, the method returns without performing any signature verification. The `parseResponse` method then assumes the signature is valid and proceeds with processing the message, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Signature Exclusion:** The primary vulnerability is that the library does not enforce signature verification if a signature element is absent, violating the expected behavior.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code doesn't properly validate if a signature is present and required before processing a SAML message.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can forge SAML messages and bypass authentication.
- **Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate other users within the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain arbitrary roles/privileges within the application, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Forged SAML Messages:** The attack vector involves crafting a SAML message without a `<Signature>` element and sending it to a vulnerable application.
- **Direct Submission:** The forged SAML message is sent to the application's SAML endpoint, such as `/sso/saml`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application's SAML endpoint.
- **SAML Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the SAML protocol and its structure to craft the forged messages.
- **Unauthenticated access** No prior authentication needed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is a "signature exclusion attack," which is a type of XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attack. The provided material provides a detailed analysis of XSW attacks in SAML.
- The blog post from `blog.intothesymmetry.com` describes a similar vulnerability in Slack, though this is not related to CVE-2020-12676.
- The `github.com` content describes SAMLRaider, a Burp Suite extension that can be used to test for and exploit such SAML vulnerabilities.

**Summary**

The `fusionauth-samlv2` library failed to properly enforce SAML message signature verification, allowing unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication by sending unsigned SAML messages. This vulnerability could allow attackers to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to applications utilizing the vulnerable library.
