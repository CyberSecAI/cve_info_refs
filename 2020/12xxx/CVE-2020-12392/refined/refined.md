{
  "CVE-2020-12392": {
    "Description": "The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP POST data of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as cURL' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in the disclosure of local files.",
    "Root cause": "The 'Copy as cURL' feature in Devtools used `--data` instead of `--data-raw` when generating curl commands for requests with POST data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper escaping of HTTP POST data in the 'Copy as cURL' functionality",
      "Use of `--data` in curl, which can interpret the data as a filename to upload if it starts with '@'"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary local file disclosure if a user pastes the generated curl command into a terminal.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious website can craft a POST request where the body starts with the character '@' followed by the path to a file.",
      "A user must then use the 'Copy as cURL' feature of the developer tools on that specific request and paste it in a terminal for the exploit to occur."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to craft a malicious website that can be visited by the victim",
      "User must use Firefox browser",
      "User must copy the curl command from the Devtools network tab and paste into a shell for the exploit to occur"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered when the user uses the 'Copy as cURL' feature and pastes the generated command into a terminal. The curl command uses `--data` which, if the POST data starts with `@`, treats the rest of the data as a file path to upload instead of the raw data."
