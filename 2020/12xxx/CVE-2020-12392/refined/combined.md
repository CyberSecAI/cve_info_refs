Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer, philipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, André Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

# USN-4373-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

26 May 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6831](/security/CVE-2020-6831), [CVE-2020-12387](/security/CVE-2020-12387), [CVE-2020-12395](/security/CVE-2020-12395))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

properly escape the HTTP POST data of a request. If a user were tricked

in to using the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with

specially crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2020-12392](/security/CVE-2020-12392))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not correctly handle Unicode

whitespace characters within the From email header. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to spoof the sender email address that

Thunderbird displays. ([CVE-2020-12397](/security/CVE-2020-12397))

|  | |

Upstream usrsctp has been notified about a buffer overflow in their implementation.

The patch for it is available upstream here <https://github.com/sctplab/usrsctp/commit/e1dd9bea4f438abf4d4c3b658f1db8f013157184>

Alternatively we could work around the problematic code path by disabling SCTP authentication with the following (as that feature isn't used in webrtc any way):

usrsctp\_sysctl\_set\_sctp\_asconf\_enable(0);

usrsctp\_sysctl\_set\_sctp\_auth\_enable(0);

Public commit doesn't literally say "SECURITY BUG!" but it does thank a prominent member of Google Project Zero. We should get a fix into 76 and ESR. Nils suggests using the the "turn it off" patch for uplift. I wouldn't mind taking both!

[Bug 1632241](/show_bug.cgi?id=1632241 "RESOLVED FIXED - Buffer overflow in sctp chunk input validation"): add SCTP auth token boundary check

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Not very hard with knowledge on how WebRTC data channel works.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Not very likely as the affected code paths normally should not be triggered by normal WebRTC endpoints.

[Bug 1632241](/show_bug.cgi?id=1632241 "RESOLVED FIXED - Buffer overflow in sctp chunk input validation"): add SCTP auth token boundary check

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: It is sec-high
* **User impact if declined**: Users would be exposed to the technically possible drive-by buffer overflow.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 76
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The risk is low, because the buffer overflow is on a code path which is normally not used in WebRTC. That means only a specifically crafted PeerConnection endpoints which sends packets which are normally not send as part of WebRTC connection could trigger this.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: N/A

Looks like Chrome is going to ship this fix in an update to their current Stable 81 soon and not wait for 83 (there was no 82)

After the discussion about the patch for [bug 1607742](/show_bug.cgi?id=1607742 "RESOLVED FIXED - 'Copy As Curl' in the network panel of the devtools does not escape the HTTP method properly, leading to local code execution"), I made a few more experiments with the "Copy as curl" functionality, and found another vulnerability : POST data is sent using '--data' instead of '--data-raw'. This means that if the body of an HTTP request starts with the character '@', the rest of the body will be interpreted as a file name to send instead of raw data.

An attacker can use this bug to read local files on the computer of an user of the "Copy as curl" functionality. The only thing he has to do is making a request such as the following :

```
fetch('', {body: '@/etc/passwd', method:'POST'})

```

When the user will use 'copy as curl' on the generated request, and then execute the curl command, the contents of /etc/passwd will be send to the attacker's server.

Fixing this bug is as simple as using --data-raw instead of --data.

I really like contributing to free software, but after looking at the instructions for the devtools (<https://docs.firefox-dev.tools/getting-started/build.html>), I feel like it's not worth pulling gigabytes of dependencies, including several compilers, for just a 1-line javascript fix. So I'll have to decline the offer.

It would be nice if the Firefox dev tools could be decoupled from Firefox itself, just like the chrome dev tools: <https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend>

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer, philipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, André Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Step to reproduce:
1. Navigate the following data URL (or create a HTML document with the same content and navigate it):
data:text/html,<meta http-equiv="Content-security-policy" content="script-src none;"/><script>alert(location)</script><object data="data:text/html,object<script>alert('object')</script>"></object><iframe src="data:text/html,iframe<script>alert('frame')</script>"></iframe>
Expected result: no JavaScript gets executed (no alert is shown)
Actual result: one alert saying "object" is shown
This demonstrates that the iframe's document inherits parent's CSP, but the object's document doesn't. According to <https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#which-policy-applies> they should behave the same way, i.e. being governed by "the policy of the embedding resource".
This can be also used to bypass WebExtensions relying on CSP to block scripts: even though the embedded document has null origin, it could deliver a self-contained exploit.

This should be easier to fix when we move CSP to the loadinfo ([bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client"))Priority: -- → P3Whiteboard: [domsecurity-backlog2]

Did this actually get fixed by [bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client") as predicted?

I am clearing old ni?s at the moment and I realized [bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client") did not fix the problem described here, though it made it easier to fix the problem described here. Assigning to myself.
