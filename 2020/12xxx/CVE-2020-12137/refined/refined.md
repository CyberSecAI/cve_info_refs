Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12137:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-12137, as evidenced by:

*   Mentions of the CVE ID "CVE-2020-12137" within the text, specifically in relation to Mailman and its handling of file attachments.
*   Descriptions of the vulnerability align with the CVE description, regarding scrubbed MIME parts with the .obj extension leading to potential XSS attacks.
*   References to specific fixes for CVE-2020-12137, like changing the file extension to `.bin`.

**2. Extraction of Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from Mailman using the `.obj` extension for scrubbed `application/octet-stream` MIME parts. This leads to MIME sniffing issues by web browsers.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **MIME Sniffing:** Web browsers can attempt to determine the MIME type of a resource based on its content (MIME sniffing), which may lead to misinterpretation of the `.obj` files as text/html.
    *   **Lack of MIME Type:** The web server may send a response without a specific `Content-Type` header for files with the `.obj` extension.
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** If a file with a `.obj` extension contains HTML or Javascript code, and the browser interprets it as such, then the code will be executed.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS Attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a message and have it executed by users viewing the message archive.
    *   **Arbitrary HTML Execution:** Attackers can inject HTML code that could lead to spoofing, phishing, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a crafted email message containing a file attachment without or with an unknown file extension, that is then scrubbed and stored by Mailman in the archive.
    *   A user must visit the list archive through a web browser.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker must be able to send emails to the mailing list that will be archived.
    *   The attacker does not need to be a member or moderator of the mailing list.
    *   The attacker does not need to compromise the server.

**3. Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is addressed by changing the extension for scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME parts from `.obj` to `.bin`, which is less likely to be interpreted as HTML by browsers and commonly associated with application/octet-stream.
*   **Mailman Versions:** The fix was introduced in Mailman version 2.1.30rc1, but not in any stable releases prior to 2.1.30.
*  **Mitigations:** The content also notes that some web servers might send a default MIME type for unknown file extensions, mitigating the issue. The use of  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header will not prevent this vulnerability type in all browsers.
*  **Affected Software:** Multiple sources mention the vulnerability affecting versions of Mailman prior to 2.1.30, and impacting various Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and SUSE.
*   **CVSS Scores:** Different sources list CVSS v2 and v3 scores. The CVSS v3 score ranges from 4.3 to 6.5
*   **Workaround:** Although not recommended, configuring the web server to send a default `Content-Type` header for the .obj extension would mitigate the issue.
*   **Cross-References:** The content provides links to various bug trackers and mailing lists where this vulnerability was discussed.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-12137 is a moderate-severity vulnerability in GNU Mailman related to how file attachments with `.obj` extensions are handled in web archives. This can lead to XSS attacks. The vulnerability is triggered by MIME-sniffing in browsers on archived files that lack a proper `Content-Type` header and have HTML/JavaScript content. The primary fix is to change the extension to `.bin`, which prevents the browser from interpreting the file as HTML. The vulnerability is considered resolved in Mailman version 2.1.30 and later, as well as in relevant updates for affected Linux distributions.
