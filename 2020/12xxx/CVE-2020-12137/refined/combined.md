# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

This can be used       to modify mail to addresses that don't accept external mail From:       themselves.      - There is a new MAX_LISTNAME_LENGTH setting.  The fix for LP: #1780874       obtains a list of the names of all the all the lists in the installation       in order to determine the maximum length of a legitimate list name.  It       does this on every web access and on sites with a very large number of       lists, this can have performance implications.  See the description in       Defaults.py for more information.      - Thanks to Ralf Jung there is now the ability to add text based captchas       (aka textchas) to the listinfo subscribe form.  See the documentation       for the new CAPTCHA setting in Defaults.py for how to enable this.  Also       note that if you have custom listinfo.html templates, you will have to       add a <mm-captcha-ui> tag to those templates to make this work.  This       feature can be used in combination with or instead of the Google       reCAPTCHA feature added in 2.1.26.      - Thanks to Ralf Hildebrandt the web admin Membership Management section       now has a feature to sync the list's membership with a list of email       addresses as with the bin/sync_members command.      - There is a new drop_cc list attribute set from DEFAULT_DROP_CC.  This       controls the dropping of addresses from the Cc: header in delivered       messages by the duplicate avoidance process.  (LP: #1845751)      - There is a new REFUSE_SECOND_PENDING mm_cfg.py setting that will cause       a second request to subscribe to a list when there is already a pending       confirmation for that user.

(LP: #1831321)      - With the Postfix MTA and virtual domains, mappings for the site list       -bounces and -request addresses in each virtual domain are now added       to data/virtual-mailman (-owner was done in 2.1.24).  (LP: #1831777)      - The paths.py module now extends sys.path with the result of       site.getsitepackages() if available.  (LP: #1838866)      - A bug causing a UnicodeDecodeError in preparing to send the confirmation       request message to a new subscriber has been fixed.

Bug fixes and other patches      - The BLOCK_SPAMHAUS_LISTED_DBL_SUBSCRIBE feature added in 2.1.27 was       not working.  This is fixed.  (LP: #1779774)      - Escaping of HTML entities for the web UI is now done more selectively.       (LP: #1779445)  2.1.27 (22-Jun-2018)    Security      - Existing protections against malicious listowners injecting evil       scripts into listinfo pages have had a few more checks added.       JVN#00846677/JPCERT#97432283/CVE-2018-0618      - A few more error messages have had their values HTML escaped.       JVN#00846677/JPCERT#97432283/CVE-2018-0618      - The hash generated when SUBSCRIBE_FORM_SECRET is set could have been       the same as one generated at the same time for a different list and       IP address.  While this is not thought to be exploitable in any way,       the generation has been changed to avoid this.  Thanks to Ralf Jung.    New Features      - An option has been added to bin/add_members to issue invitations       instead of immediately adding members.  (LP: #1773064)      - A new BLOCK_SPAMHAUS_LISTED_IP_SUBSCRIBE setting has been added to       enable blocking web subscribes from IPv4 addresses listed in Spamhaus       SBL, CSS or XBL.  It will work with IPv6 addresses if Python's       py2-ipaddress module is installed.  The module can be installed via pip       if not included in your Python.      - Thanks to Jim Popovitch, Mailman has a new 'security' log and logs       authentication failures to the various web CGI functions.  The logged       data include the remote IP and can be used to automate blocking of IPs       with something like fail2ban.  Since Mailman 2.1.14, these have returned       an http 401 status and the information should be logged by the web       server, but this new log makes that more convenient.  Also, the       'mischief' log entries for 'hostile listname' noe include the remote IP       if available.      - Thanks to Jim Popovitch, admin notices of (un)subscribes now may give       the source of the action.  This consists of a %(whence)s replacement       that has been added to the admin(un)subscribeack.txt templates.  Thanks       to Yasuhito FUTATSUKI for updating the non-English templates and help       with internationalizing the reasons.      - Thanks to Jim Popovitch, there is a new       BLOCK_SPAMHAUS_LISTED_DBL_SUBSCRIBE setting to enable blocking web       subscribes for addresses in domains listed in the Spamhaus DBL.    i18n      - The Japanese translation has been updated by Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.      - The Russian translation has been updated by Danil Smirnov.      - A partial Esperanto translation has been added.

(LP: #1777342)    Bug fixes and other patches      - Some messages from bin/arch were not issued in the charset of the system       locale when DISABLE_COMMAND_LOCALE_CSET is No.  Thanks to Yasuhito       FUTATSUKI this is now fixed.  (LP: #1768892)      - The message displayed in the browser when accessing a Mailman CGI when       mm_cfg.py can't be imported due to some exception other than ImportError       has been improved.  (LP: #1760506)      - The reimplementation of DELIVERY_RETRY_WAIT in 2.1.26 could cause extra       dequeueing and requeueing in the out queue by OutgoingRunner.  This is       fixed.  (LP: #1762871)      - A Python 2.7 dependency introduced in the ToDigests handler in Mailman       2.1.24 has been removed.  (LP: #1755317)      - Bad values in a list's topics will no longer break everything that       might instantiate the list.  (LP: #1754516)      - A Python 2.7 dependency introduced with the reCAPTCHA feature in 2.1.26       has been removed.  (LP: #1752658)      - The reCAPTCHA feature requires JavaScript.  If JavaScript is not enabled,       a message will be displayed on the subscribe form that JavaScript is       required.  (LP: #1769374)      - Quoting in the mailman-config command has been changed from double to       single quotes to allow double-quoted parameters.  (LP: #1774986)      - Approving a held subscription for a user with a 'different' preferred       language no longer corrupts the results page.  (LP: #1777222)      - An issue with garbled descriptions on listinfo and admin overview pages       and the heading of a list's listinfo page due to incompatible character       sets has been fixed thanks to Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.    Miscellaneous      - Added to the contrib directory, a script from Jim Popovitch to generate       Sitemap files for a list's archive.  2.1.26 (04-Feb-2018)    Security      - An XSS vulnerability in the user options CGI could allow a crafted URL       to execute arbitrary javascript in a user's browser.  A related issue       could expose information on a user's options page without requiring       login.  These are fixed.  Thanks to Calum Hutton for the report.       CVE-2018-5950  (LP: #1747209)    New Features      - Thanks to David SiebÃ¶rger who adapted an existing patch by Andrea       Veri to use Google reCAPTCHA v2 there is now the ability to add       reCAPTCHA to the listinfo subscribe form.  There are two new mm_cfg.py       settings for RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY and RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY, the values       for which you obtain for your domain(s) from Google at       <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin>.      - Thanks to Lindsay Haisley, there is a new bin/mailman-config command       to display various information about this Mailman version and how it       was configured.    i18n      - The Japanese message catalog has been updated for added strings by       Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.      - The German translation of a couple of templates has been updated by       Thomas Hochstein.      - The Japanese translation of Defaults.py.in has been updated by       Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.

(LP #1744739)      - Mailman 2.1.22 introduced a Python 2.7 dependency that could affect       bin/arch processing a message without a valid Date: header.  The       dependency has been removed.  (LP: #1740543)      - Messages held for header_filter_rules now show the matched regexp in       the hold reason.  (LP: #1737371)      - When updating the group and mode of a .db file with Mailman's Postfix       integration, a missing file is ignored.  (LP: #1734162)      - The DELIVERY_RETRY_WAIT setting is now effective.  (LP: #1729472)  2.1.25 (26-Oct-2017)    New Features      - The admindb held subscriptions listing now includes the date of the       most recent request from the address.  (LP: #1697097)    Accessibility      - The admin Membership List now includes text for screen readers which       identifies the function of each checkbox.  CSS is added to the page to       visually hide the text but still allow screen readers to read it.       Similar text has been added to some radio buttons on the admindb pages.    i18n      - The Russian translation has been updated by Sergey Matveev.       (LP: #1708016)    Bug fixes and other patches      - Thanks to Jim Popovitch, certain failures in DNS lookups of DMARC policy       will now result in mitigations being applied.  (LP: #1722013)      - The default DMARC reject reason now properly replaces %(listowner)s.       (LP: #1718962)      - The web roster page now shows case preserved email addresses.

(LP: #1705736)      - Fixed MTA/Postfix.py to ensure that created aliases(.db) and       virtual-mailman(.db) files are readable by Postfix and the .db files are       owned by the Mailman user.  (LP: #1696066)      - Defended against certain web attacks that cause exceptions and "we hit       a bug" responses when POST data or query fragments contain multiple       values for the same parameter.  (LP: #1695667)      - The fix for LP: #1614841 caused a regression in the options CGI.  This       has been fixed.  (LP: #1602608)      - Added a -a option to the (e)grep commands in contrib/mmdsr to account       for logs that may have non-ascii and be seen as binary.      - Fixed the -V option to bin/list_lists to not show lists whose host is a       subdomain of the given domain.  (LP: #1695610)  2.1.24 (02-Jun-2017)    Security      - A most likely unexploitable XSS attach that relies on the Mailman web       server passing a crafted Host: header to the CGI environment has been       fixed.  Apache for one is not vulnerable.  Thanks to Alqnas Eslam.    New Features      - There is a new RCPT_BASE64_HEADER_NAME setting.  If this is set to a       non-empty string, that string is the name of a header that will be added       to personalized and VERPed deliveries with value equal to the base64       encoding of the recipient's email address.  This is intended to enable       identification of the recipient otherwise redacted from "spam report"       feedback loop messages.      - cron/senddigests has a new -e/--exceptlist option to send pending       digests for all but a named list.  (LP: #1619770)      - The values for DEFAULT_DIGEST_FOOTER and DEFAULT_MSG_FOOTER have been       changed to use a standard signature separator for DEFAULT_MSG_FOOTER       and to remove the unneded line of underscores from DEFAULT_DIGEST_FOOTER.       (LP: #266269)    i18n      - The Polish html templates have been recoded to use html entities       instead of non-ascii characters.      - The Basque (Euskara) translation has been updated by Gari Araolaza.      - The German "details for personalize" page has been updated by       Christian F Buser.      - The Japanese translation has been updated by Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.    Bug fixes and other patches      - The list-owner@virtual.domain addresses are now added to virtual-mailman       as they are exposed in 'list created' emails.  (LP: #1694384)      - The 'list run by' addresses in web page footers are now just the       list-owner address.  (LP: #1694384)      - Changed member_verbosity_threshold from a >= test to a strictly > test       to avoid the issue of moderating every post when the threshold = 1.       (LP: #1693366)      - Subject prefixing has been improved to always have a space between       the prefix and the subject even with non-ascii in the prefix.  This       will sometimes result in two spaces when the prefix is non-ascii but       the subject is ascii, but this is the lesser evil.  (LP: #1525954)      - Treat message and digest headers and footers as empty if they contain       only whitespace.  (LP: #1673307)      - Ensured that added message and digest headers and footers always have       a terminating new-line.  (LP: #1670033)      - Fixed an uncaught TypeError in the subscribe CGI.

(LP: #1661810)      - Fixed a NameError issue in bin/add_members with       DISABLE_COMMAND_LOCALE_CSET = yes.  (LP: #1647450)      - The CleanseDKIM handler has been removed from OWNER_PIPELINE.  It isn't       needed there and has adverse DMARC implications for messages to -owner       of an anonymous list.  (LP: #1645901)      - Fixed an issue with properly RFC 2047 encoding the display name in the       From: header for messages with DMARC mitigations.  (LP: #1643210)      - Fixed an issue causing UnicodeError in sending digests following a       change of a list's preferred_language.

(LP: #266464)      - Fixed a typo in Utils.py that could have resulted in a NameError in       logging an unlikely occurrence.  (LP: #1637745)      - Fixed a bug which created incorrect "view more members" links at the       bottom of the admin Membership List pages.  (LP: #1637061)      - The 2.1.23 fix for LP: #1604544 only fixed the letter links at the top       of the Membership List.  The links at the bottom have now been fixed.      - paths.py now adds dist-packages as well as site-packages to sys.path.       (LP: #1621172)      - INIT INFO has been added to the sample init.d script.  (LP: #1620121)  2.1.23 (27-Aug-2016)    Security      - CSRF protection has been extended to the user options page.  This was       actually fixed by Tokio Kikuchi as part of the fix for LP: #775294 and       intended for Mailman 2.1.15, but that fix wasn't completely merged at the       time.  The full fix also addresses the admindb, and edithtml pages as       well as the user options page and the previously fixed admin pages.       Thanks to Nishant Agarwala for reporting the issue.  CVE-2016-6893       (LP: #1614841)    New Features      - For header_filter_rules matching, RFC 2047 encoded headers, non-encoded       headers and header_filter_rules patterns are now all decoded to unicode.       Both XML character references of the form &#nnnn; and unicode escapes       of the form \Uxxxx in patterns are converted to unicodes as well.  Both       headers and patterns are normalized to 'NFKC' normal form before       matching, but the normalization form can be set via a new NORMALIZE_FORM       mm_cfg setting.  Also, the web UI has been updated to encode characters       in text fields that are invalid in the character set of the page's       language as XML character references instead of '?'.  This should help       with entering header_filter_rules patterns to match 'odd' characters.       This feature is experimental and is problematic for some cases where it       is desired to have a header_filter_rules pattern with characters not in       the character set of the list's preferred language.  For patterns       without such characters, the only change in behavior should be because       of unicode normalization which should improve matching.  For other       situations such as trying to match a Subject: with CJK characters (range       U+4E00..U+9FFF) on an English language (ascii) list, one can enter a       pattern like '^subject:.*[&#19968;-&#40959;]' or       '^subject:.*[\u4e00;-\u9fff;]' to match a Subject with any character in       the range, and it will work, but depending on the actual characters and       the browser, submitting another, even unrelated change can garble the       original entry although this usually occurs only with ascii pages and       characters in the range \u0080-\u00ff.  The \Uxxxx unicode escapes must       have exactly 4 hex digits, but they are case insensitive.  (LP: #558155)      - Thanks to Jim Popovitch REMOVE_DKIM_HEADERS can now be set to 3 to       preserve the original headers as X-Mailman-Original-... before removing       them.      - Several additional templates have been added to those that can be edited       via the web admin GUI.  (LP: #1583387)      - SMTPDirect.py can now do SASL authentication and STARTTLS security when       connecting to the outgoiung MTA. Associated with this are new       Defaults.py/mm_cfg.py settings SMTP_AUTH, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWD and       SMTP_USE_TLS.  (LP: #558281)      - There is a new Defaults.py/mm_cfg.py setting SMTPLIB_DEBUG_LEVEL which       can be set to 1 to enable verbose smtplib debugging to Mailman's error       log to help with debugging 'low level smtp failures'.  (LP: #1573074)      - A list's nonmember_rejection_notice attribute will now be the default       rejection reason for a held non-member post in addition to it's prior       role as the reson for an automatically rejected non-member post.       (LP: #1572330)    i18n      - The French translation of 'Dutch' is changed from 'Hollandais' to       'NÃ©erlandais' per Francis Jorissen.      - Some German language templates that were incorrectly utf-8 encoded have       been recoded as iso-8859-1.  (LP: #1602779)      - Japanese translation and documentation in messages/ja has been updated by       Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.    Bug fixes and other patches      - The admin Membership List letter links could be incorrectly rendered as       Unicode strings following a search.  (LP: #1604544)      - We no longer throw an uncaught TypeError with certain defective crafted       POST requests to Mailman's CGIs.  (LP: #1602608)      - Scrubber links in archives are now in the list's preferred_language       rather than the poster's language.  (LP: #1586505)      - Improved logging of banned subscription and address change attempts.       (LP: #1582856)      - In rare circumstances a list can be removed while the admin or listinfo       CGI or bin/list_lists is running causing an uncaught MMUnknownListError       to be thrown.  The exception is now caught and handled.  (LP: #1582532)      - Set the Date: header in the wrapper message when from_is_list or       dmarc_moderation_action is Wrap Message.  (LP: #1581215)      - A site can now set DMARC_ORGANIZATIONAL_DOMAIN_DATA_URL to None or the       null string if it wants to avoid using this.  (LP: #1578450)      - The white space to the left of the admindb Logout link is no longer       part of the link.  (LP: #1573623)  2.1.22 (17-Apr-2016)    i18n      - Fixed a typo in the German options.html template.  (LP: #1562408)      - An error in the Brazilian Portugese translation of Quarterly has been       fixed thanks to Kleber A. Benatti.      - The Brazilian Portugese translation has been updated by Emerson Ribeiro       de Mello.    Bug fixes and other patches      - All addresses in data/virtual-mailman are now properly appended with       VIRTUAL_MAILMAN_LOCAL_DOMAIN and duplicates are not generated if the       site list is in a virtual domain.  (LP: #1570630)      - DMARC mitigations will now find the From: domain to the right of the       rightmost '@' rather than the leftmost '@'.  (LP: #1568445)      - DMARC mitigations for a sub-domain of an organizational domain will now       use the organizational domain's sp= policy if any.  (LP: #1568398)      - Modified NewsRunner.py to ensure that messages gated to Usenet have a       non-blank Subject: header and when munging the Message-ID to add the       original to References: to help with threading.  (LP: #557955)      - Fixed the pipermail archiver to do a better job of figuring the date of       a post when its Date: header is missing, unparseable or has an obviously       out of range date.  This should only affect bin/arch as ArchRunner has       code to fix dates at least if ARCHIVER_CLOBBER_DATE_POLICY has not been       set to 0 in mm_cfg.py.  If posts have been added in the past to a list's       archive using bin/arch and an imported mbox, running bin/arch again could       result is some of those posts being archived with a different date.       (LP: #1555798)      - Fixed an issue with CommandRunner shunting a malformed message with a       null byte in the body.  (LP: #1553888)      - Don't collapse multipart with a single sub-part inside multipart/signed       parts.  (LP: #1551075)  2.1.21 (28-Feb-2016)    New Features      - There is a new dmarc_none_moderation_action list setting and a       DEFAULT_DMARC_NONE_MODERATION_ACTION mm_cfg.py setting to optionally       apply Munge From or Wrap Message actions to posts From: domains that       publish DMARC p=none.  The intent is to eliminate failure reports to       the domain owner for messages that would be munged or wrapped if the       domain published a stronger DMARC policy.  See the descriptions in       Defaults.py, the web UI and the bug report for more.  (LP: #1539384)      - Thanks to Jim Popovitch there is now a feature to automatically turn       on moderation for a malicious list member who attempts to flood a list       with spam.  See the details for the Privacy options ... -> Sender       filters -> member_verbosity_threshold and member_verbosity_interval       settings in the web admin UI and the documentation in Defaults.py for       the DEFAULT_MEMBER_VERBOSITY_* and VERBOSE_CLEAN_LIMIT settings for       information.      - bin/list_members now has options to display all moderated or all       non-moderated members.      - There is now a mm_cfg.py setting GLOBAL_BAN_LIST which is like the       individual list's ban_list but applies globally to all subscribe       requests.  See the description in Defaults.py for more details.    i18n      - The Japanese translation has been updated by Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.      - Also thanks to Miloslav Trmac and Yasuhito FUTATSUKI, the l10n for       Mailman's bin/ commands has been fixed to display using the character       set of the user's work station even when Mailman's character set for       the language is different.  Because this has not been tested over a       wide set of locales, there is an mm_cfg.py switch       DISABLE_COMMAND_LOCALE_CSET to disable it if it causes problems.       (LP: #558167)      - The Polish translation has been updated by Stefan Plewako.      - The German translation has been updated by Mirian Margiani and       Bernhard Schmidt.      - The Russian translation has been updated by Danil Smirnov.      - Several Galician templates that were improperly encoded as iso-8859-1       have been fixed.  (LP: #1532504)      - The Brazilian Portugese translation has been updated by Emerson Ribeiro       de Mello.    Bug fixes and other patches      - If DMARC lookup fails to find a policy, also try the Organizational       Domain.  Associated with this is a new mm_cfg.py setting       DMARC_ORGANIZATIONAL_DOMAIN_DATA_URL which sets the URL used to       retrieve the data for the algorithm that computes the Organizational       Domain.  See https://publicsuffix.org/list/ for info.  (LP: #1549420)      - Modified contrib/mmdsr to correctly report No such list names that       contain ".      - User's "Acknowledge" option will now be honored for posts to anonymous       lists.  (LP: #1546679)      - Fixed a typo in the Non-digest options regular_exclude_ignore       description thanks to Yasuhito FUTATSUKI.      - DEFAULT_PASS_MIME_TYPES has been changed to accept text/plain sub-parts       from message/rfc822 parts and multipart parts other than mixed and       alternative and also accept pgp signatures.  This only applies to newly       created lists and other than pgp signatures, still only accepts       text/plain.  (LP: #1517446)      - Modified contrib/mmdsr to report held and banned subscriptions and DMARC       lookups in their own categories.      - Fixed a bug that could create a garbled From: header with certain DMARC       mitigation actions.  (LP: #1536816)      - Treat a poster's address which matches an equivalent_domains address as       a list member for the regular_exclude_ignore check.  (LP: #1526550)      - Fixed an issue that sometimes left no white space following       subject_prefix.  (LP: #1525954)      - Vette log entries for banned subscriptions now include the source of       the request if available.  (LP: #1525733)      - Submitting the user options form for a user who was asynchronously       unsubscribed would throw an uncaught NotAMemberError.  (LP: #1523273)      - It was possible under some circumstances for a message to be shunted       after a handler rejected or discarded it, and the handler would be       skipped upon unshunting and the message accepted.  (LP: #1519062)      - Posts gated to usenet will no longer have other than the target group       in the Newsgroups: header.  (LP: #1512866)      - Invalid regexps in *_these_nonmembers, subscribe_auto_approval and       ban_list are now logged.  (LP: #1507241)      - Refactored the GetPattern list method to simplify extending @listname       syntax to new attributes in the future.  Changed Moderate.py to use the       GetPattern method to process the *_these_nonmembers lists.      - Changed CookHeaders to default to using space rather than tab as       continuation_ws when folding headers.  (LP: #1505878)      - Fixed the 'pidfile' path in the sample init.d script.  (LP: #1503422)      - Subject prefixing could fail to collapse multiple 'Re:' in an incomming       message if they all came after the list's subject_prefix.  This is now       fixed.  (LP: #1496620)      - Defended against a user submitting URLs with query fragments or POST       data containing multiple occurrences of the same variable.       (LP: #1496632)      - Fixed bin/mailmanctl to check its effective rather than real uid.       (LP: #1491187)      - Fixed cron/gate_news to catch EOFError on opening the newsgroup.       (LP: #1486263)      - Fixed a bug where a delayed probe bounce can throw an AttributeError.       (LP: #1482940)      - If a list is not digestable an the user is not currently set to       receive digests, the digest options will not be shown on the user's       options page.  (LP: #1476298)      - Improved identification of remote clients for logging and subscribe       form checking in cases where access is via a proxy server.  Thanks to       Jim Popovitch.  Also updated contrib/mmdsr for log change.      - Fixed an issue with shunted messages on a list where the charset for       the list's preferred_language had been changed from iso-8859-1 to       utf-8 without recoding the list's description.  (LP: #1462755)      - Mailman-Postfix integration will now add mailman@domain entries in       data/virtual-mailman for each domain in POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS       which is a host_name of a list.  This is so the addresses which are       exposed on admin and listinfo overview pages of virtual domains will       be deliverable.  (LP: #1459236)      - The vette log entry for DMARC policy hits now contains the list name.       (LP: #1450826)      - If SUBSCRIBE_FORM_SECRET is enabled and a user's network has a load       balancer or similar in use the POSTing IP might not exactly match the       GETting IP.  This is now accounted for by not requiring the last       octet (16 bits for ipV6) to match.  (LP: #1447445)      - DKIM-Signature:, DomainKey-Signature: and Authentication-Results:       headers are now removed by default from posts to anonymous lists.       (LP: #1444673)      - The list admin web UI Mambership List search function often doesn't       return correct results for search strings (regexps) that contain       non-ascii characters.  This is partially fixed.  (LP: #1442298)  2.1.20 (31-Mar-2015)    Security      - A path traversal vulnerability has been discovered and fixed.  This       vulnerability is only exploitable by a local user on a Mailman server       where the suggested Exim transport, the Postfix postfix_to_mailman.py       transport or some other programmatic MTA delivery not using aliases       is employed.  CVE-2015-2775  (LP: #1437145)    New Features      - There is a new Address Change sub-section in the web admin Membership       Management section to allow a list admin to change a list member's       address in one step rather than adding the new address, copying settings       and deleting the old address.  (LP: #266809)    i18n      - The Russian translation has been updated by Danil Smirnov.      - The Polish translation has been updated by Stefan Plewako.    Bug fixes and other patches      - A LookupError in SpamDetect on a message with RFC 2047 encoded headers       in an unknown character set is fixed.  (LP: #1427389)      - Fixed a bug in CommandRunner that could process the second word of a       body line as a command word and a case sensitivity in commands in       Subject: with an Re: prefix.  (LP: #1426829)      - Fixed a bug in CommandRunner that threw an uncaught KeyError if       the input to the list-request address contained a command word       terminated by a period.  (LP: #1426825)  2.2 Branch Backports (released in conjunction with 2.1.19)    The following New Features and Bug Fixes have been in an "unofficial,   never to be released" Mailman 2.2 branch for several years. Until now,   they were never implemented on the official 2.1 branch because of their   i18n impacts.  Given that there have been a number of i18n impacting   changes due to DMARC mitigations in the last few releases, it has been   decided to backport these as well.    All of these changes have been running in production on several lists   for years without problems other than untranslated strings, so they should   be reasonably "bug free".    New Features      - There is a new list attribute 'subscribe_auto_approval' which is a list       of email addresses and regular expressions matching email addresses       whose subscriptions are exempt from admin approval.  (LP: #266609)      - Confirmed member change of address is logged in the 'subscribe' log,       and if admin_notify_mchanges is true, a notice is sent to the list       owner using a new adminaddrchgack.txt template.      - Added an 'automate' option to bin/newlist to send the notice to the       admin without the prompt.      - The processing of Topics regular expressions has changed. Previously the       Topics regexp was compiled in verbose mode but not documented as such       which caused some confusion.  Also, the documentation indicated that       topic keywords could be entered one per line, but these entries were not       handled properly.  Topics regexps are now compiled in non-verbose mode       and multi-line entries are 'ored'.  Existing Topics regexps will be       converted when the list is updated so they will continue to work.      - Added real name display to the web roster.  (LP: #266754)     Bug fixes and other patches      - Changed the response to an invalid confirmation to be more generic.       Not all confirmations are subscription requests.      - Changed the default nonmember_rejection_notice to be more user friendly.       (LP: #418728)      - Added "If you are a list member" qualification to some messages from the       options login page.  (LP: #266442)      - Changed the 'Approve' wording in the admindbdetails.html template to       'Accept/Approve' for better agreement with the button labels.      - Added '(by thread)' to the previous and next message links in the       archive to emphasize that even if you got to the message from a       subject, date or author index, previous and next are still by thread.  2.1.19 (28-Feb-2015)    New Features      - The subscribe_auto_approval feature backported from the 2.2 branch and       described above has been enhanced to accept entries of the form       @listname to auto approve members of another list.  (LP: #1417093)      - There is a new list attribute dmarc_wrapped_message_text and a       DEFAULT_DMARC_WRAPPED_MESSAGE_TEXT setting to set the default for new       lists.  This text is added to a message which is wrapped because of       dmarc_moderation_action in a separate text/plain part that precedes the       message/rfc822 part containing the original message.  It can be used to       provide an explanation of why the message was wrapped or similar info.      - There is a new list attribute equivalent_domains and a       DEFAULT_EQUIVALENT_DOMAINS setting to set the default for new lists which       in turn defaults to the empty string.  This provides a way to specify one       or more groups of domains, e.g., mac.com, me.com, icloud.com, which are       considered equivalent for validating list membership for posting and       moderation purposes.      - There is a new WEB_HEAD_ADD setting to specify text to be added to the       <HEAD> section of Mailman's internally generated web pages.  This doesn't       apply to pages built from templates, but in those cases, custom templates       can be created.  (LP: #1409396)      - There is a new DEFAULT_SUBSCRIBE_OR_INVITE setting.  Set this to Yes       to make the default selection on the admin Mass Subscriptions page       Invite rather than Subscribe.  (LP: #1404511)      - There is a new list attribute in the Bounce processing section.       bounce_notify_owner_on_bounce_increment if set to Yes will cause       Mailman to notify the list owner on every bounce that increments a       list member's score but doesn't result in a probe or disable.  There       is a new configuration setting setting       DEFAULT_BOUNCE_NOTIFY_OWNER_ON_BOUNCE_INCREMENT to set the default       for new lists.  This in turn defaults to No.  (LP: #1382150)    Changed behavior      - Mailman's log files, request.pck files and heldmsg-* files are no       longer created world readable to protect against access by untrusted       local users.  Note that permissions on existing log files won't be       changed so if you are concerned about this and don't rotate logs or       have a logrotate process that creates new log files instead of letting       Mailman create them, you will need to address that.  (LP: #1327404)    Other changes      - The Python Powered logo image has been replaced in the misc/ directory       in the source distribution.  Depending on how you've installed these       images, you may need to copy PythonPowered.png from the misc/ directory       in the source or from the $prefix/icons/ installed directory to another       location for your web server.  (LP: #1408575)    i18n      - The Polish translation has been updated by Stefan Plewako.      - The Interlingua translation has been updated by Martijn Dekker.      - The Japanese message catalog has been updated by SATOH Fumiyasu.      - Mailman's character set for Romanian has been changed from iso-8859-2       to utf-8 and the templates and messages recoded.  This change will       require running 'bin/arch --wipe' on any existing Romanian language       lists in order to recode the list's archives, and will require recoding       any edited templates in lists/LISTNAME/ro/*, templates/DOMAIN/ro/* and       templates/site/ro/*.  It may also require recoding any existing       iso-8859-2 text in list attributes.  (LP: #1418735)      - Mailman's character set for Russian has been changed from koi8-r to       utf-8 and the templates and messages recoded.  This change will       require running 'bin/arch --wipe' on any existing Russian language       lists in order to recode the list's archives, and will require recoding       any edited templates in lists/LISTNAME/ru/*, templates/DOMAIN/ru/* and       templates/site/ru/*.  It may also require recoding any existing koi8-r       text in list attributes.  (LP: #1418448)      - Mailman's versions.py has been augmented to help with the above two       character set changes.  The first time a list with preferred_language       of Romanian or Russian is accessed or upon upgrade to this release,       any list attributes which have string values such as description, info,       welcome_msg, etc. that appear to be in the old character set will be       converted to utf-8.  This is done recursively for the values (but not       the keys) of dictionary attributes and the elements of list and tuple       attributes.      - The Russian message catalog and templates have been further updated by       Danil Smirnov.      - The Romanian message catalog has been updated.  (LP: #1415489)      - The Russian templates have been updated by Danil Smirnov.  (LP: #1403462)      - The Japanese translation has been updated by SATOH Fumiyasu.       (LP: #1402989)      - A minor change in the French translation of a listinfo subscribe form       message has been made.  (LP: #1331194)    Bug fixes and other patches      - Because of privacy concerns with the 2.2 backport adding real name to       list rosters, this is controlled by a new ROSTER_DISPLAY_REALNAME       setting that defaults to No.  You may wish to set this to Yes in       mm_cfg.py.      - Organization: headers are now unconditionally removed from posts to       anonymous lists.  Regexps in ANONYMOUS_LIST_KEEP_HEADERS weren't kept       if the regexp included the trailing ':'.  This is fixed too.       (LP: #1419132)      - The admindb interface has been fixed so the the detail message body       display doesn't lose part of a multi-byte character, and characters which       are invalid in the message's charset are replaced rather than the whole       body not being converted to the display charset.  (LP: #1415406)      - Fixed a bug in bin/rmlist that would throw an exception or just fail to       remove held message files for a list with regexp special characters in       its name.  (LP: #1414864)      - When applying DMARC mitigations, CookHeaders now adds the original From:       to Cc: rather than Reply-To: in some cases to make MUA 'reply' and       'reply all' more consistent with the non-DMARC cases.  (LP: #1407098)      - The Subject: of the list welcome message wasn't always in the user's       preferred language.  Fixed.  (LP: #1400988)      - Accept email command in Subject: prefixed with Re: or similar with no       intervening space.  (LP: #1400200)      - Fixed a UnicodeDecodeError that could occur in the web admin interface       if 'text' valued attributes have unicode values.  (LP: #1397170)      - We now catch the NotAMemberError exception thrown if an authenticated       unsubscribe is submitted from the user options page for a nonmember.       (LP: #1390653)      - Fixed an archiving bug that would cause messages with 'Subject: Re:'       only to be indexed in the archives without a link to the message.       (LP: #1388614)      - The vette log entry for a message discarded by a handler now includes       the list name and the name of the handler.  (LP: #558096)      - The options CGI now rejects all but HTTP GET and POST requests.       (LP: #1372199)      - A list's poster password will now be accepted on an Urgent: header.       (LP: #1371678)      - Fixed a bug which caused a setting of 2 for REMOVE_DKIM_HEADERS to be       ignored.  (LP: #1363278)      - Renamed messages/sr/readme.sr to README.sr.  (LP: #1360616)      - Moved the dmarc_moderation_action checks from the Moderate handler to       the SpamDetect handler so that the Reject and Discard actions will be       done before the message might be held by header_filter_rules, and the       Wrap Message and Munge From actions will be done on messages held by       header_filter_rules if the message is approved.  (LP: #1334450)      - <label> tags have been added around most check boxes and radio buttons       and their text labels in the admin and admindb web GUI so they can be       (de)selected by clicking the text.  (LP: #266391)      - If checking DNS for dmarc_moderation_action and DNS lookup is not       available, log it.  (LP: #1324541)      - Handle missing From: header addresses for DMARC mitigation actions.       (LP: #1318025)  2.1.18-1 (06-May-2014)    Bug fixes and other patches      - A critical incompatibility between the DMARC Wrap Message action and       Python versions older than 2.6.x for some x <= 5 existed and caused       Wrapped message to be shunted.  This is fixed.  (LP: #1316682)      - Sender: headers are no longer removed in from_is_list Munge From       actions.  (LP: #1315970)  2.1.18 (03-May-2014)    Acknowledgements      - Thanks to Jim Popovitch and Phil Pennock for the branch that formed the       basis of the dmarc_moderation_action feature.      - Thanks to Franck Martin et al for the branch that formed the basis of       the from_is_list feature.    Dependencies      - There is a new dependency associated with the new Privacy options ->       Sender filters -> dmarc_moderation_action feature discussed below.       This requires that the dnspython <http://www.dnspython.org/> package       be available in Python.  This package can be downloaded from the above       site or from the CheeseShop <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnspython/>       or installed with pip.    New Features      - The from_is_list feature introduced in 2.1.16 is now unconditionally       available to list owners.  There is also, a new Privacy options ->       Sender filters -> dmarc_moderation_action feature which applies to list       messages where the From: address is in a domain which publishes a DMARC       policy of reject or possibly quarantine.  This is a list setting with       values of Accept, Wrap Message, Munge From, Reject or Discard. There is       a new DEFAULT_DMARC_MODERATION_ACTION configuration setting to set the       default for this, and the list admin UI is not able to set an action       which is 'less' than the default.  The prior ALLOW_FROM_IS_LIST setting       has been removed and is effectively always Yes. There is a new       dmarc_quarantine_moderation_action list setting with default set by a       new DEFAULT_DMARC_QUARANTINE_MODERATION_ACTION configuration setting       which in turn defaults to Yes.  The list setting can be set to No to       exclude domains with DMARC policy of quarantine from       dmarc_moderation_action.        dmarc_moderation_action and from_is_list interact in the following way.       If the message is From: a domain to which dmarc_moderation_action applies       and if dmarc_moderation_action is other than Accept,       dmarc_moderation_action applies to that message.  Otherwise the       from_is_list action applies.        Also associated with dmarc_moderation_action are configuration settings       DMARC_RESOLVER_TIMEOUT and DMARC_RESOLVER_LIFETIME. These are described       in more detail in Defaults.py.  There are also new vette log entries       written when dmarc_moderation_action is found to apply to a post.    i18n      - Added missing <mm-digest-question-start> tag to French listinfo template.       (LP: #1275964)    Bug Fixes and other patches      - Removed HTML tags from the title of a couple of rmlist.py pages because       browsers don't render tags in the title.  (LP: #265848)      - Most Mailman generated notices to list owners and moderators are now       sent as Precedence: list instead of bulk.  (LP: #1313146)      - The Reply-To: munging options weren't honored if there was no       from_is_list action.  (LP: #1313010)      - Changed from_is_list actions to insert the list address in Cc: if the       list is fully personalized.  Otherwise, the list address is only in       From: and Reply-To: overrides it.  (LP: #1312970)      - Fixed the Munge From action to only Munge the From: and/or Reply-To: in       the outgoing message and not in archives, digests and messages sent via       the usenet gateway.  (LP: #1311431)      - Fixed a long standing issue in which a notice sent to a user whose       language is other than that of the list can cause subsequent things       which should be in the list's language to be in the user's language       instead.  (LP: #1308655)      - Fixed the admin Membership List so a search string if any is not lost       when visiting subsequent fragments of a chunked list.  (LP: #1307454)      - For from_is_list feature, use email address from original From: if       original From: has no display name and strip domain part from resultant       names that look like email addresses.  (LP: #1304511)      - Added the list name to the vette log "held message approved" entry.       (LP: #1295875)      - Added the CGI module name to various "No such list" error log entries.       (LP: #1295875)      - Modified contrib/mmdsr to report module name if present in "No such list       error log entries.      - Fixed a NameError exception in cron/nightly_gzip when it tries to print       the usage message.  (LP: #1291038)      - Fixed a bug in ListAdmin._handlepost that would crash when trying to       preserve a held message for the site admin if HOLD_MESSAGES_AS_PICKLES       is False.  (LP: #1282365)      - The from_is_list header munging feature introduced in Mailman 2.1.16 is       no longer erroneously applied to Mailman generated notices.       (LP: #1279667)      - Changed the message from the confirm CGI to not indicate approval is       required for an acceptance of an invitation.  (LP: #1277744)      - Fixed POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS to be case-insensitiive.       (LP: #1267003)      - Added recognition for another simple warning to bounce processing.       (LP: #1263247)      - Fixed a few failing tests in tests/test_handlers.py.  (LP: #1262950)      - Fixed bin/arch to not create scrubbed attachments for messages skipped       when processing the --start= option.  (LP: #1260883)      - Fixed email address validation to do a bit better in obscure cases.       (LP: #1258703)      - Fixed a bug which caused some authentication cookies to expire too soon       if AUTHENTICATION_COOKIE_LIFETIME is non-zero.  (LP: #1257112)      - Fixed a possible TypeError in bin/sync_members introduced in 2.1.17.       (LP: #1243343)    Miscellaneous      - Added to the contrib directory, a script from Alain Williams to count       posts in a list's archive.  2.1.17 (23-Nov-2013)    New Features      - Handling of posts gated from usenet to a list via the Mail <-> News       gateway is changed.  Formerly, no list membership, moderation or       *_these_nonmembers checks were done.  Now, if the sender of the usenet       post is a moderated member or a nonmember matching a *_these_nonmembers       filter, those checks will be done and actions applied.  Nonmember posts       from senders not matching a *_these_nonmembers filter are still accepted       as before.  (LP: #1252575)      - There is a new mm_cfg.py setting ANONYMOUS_LIST_KEEP_HEADERS.  Since it       is not possible to know which non-standard headers in a message might       reveal sender information, we now remove all headers from incoming posts       to anonymous lists except those which match regular expressions in this       list. The default setting keeps non X- headers except those known to       reveal sender information, Mailman added X- headers and x-Spam- headers.       See the description in Defaults.py for more information.  (LP: #1246039)    i18n      - The Japanese message catalog has been updated by SATOH Fumiyasu.       (LP: #1248855)    Bug Fixes and other patches      - Added a reopen command to the sample init.d script in misc/mailman.in.       (LP: #1251917)      - Fixed a misspelling in Tagger.py causing an "unexpected keyword argument       'Delete'" exception.  (LP: #1251495)      - Fixed contrib/qmail-to-mailman.py to work with a user other than       'mailman' and to recognize more listname-* addresses.  (LP: #412293)      - Fixed a possible UnicodeDecodeError in bin/sync_members.  (LP: #1243343)      - Fixed Makefile to not include $DESTDIR in paths compiled into .pyc       files for traceback purposes.  (LP: #1241770)  2.1.16 (16-Oct-2013)    New Features      - There is a new list attribute from_is_list to either rewrite the From:       header of posts replacing the posters address with that of the list or       wrap the message in an outer message From: the list for compatability       with DMARC and or ADSP.  There is a new mm_cfg.py setting       DEFAULT_FROM_IS_LIST to control the default for new lists, and the       existing REMOVE_DKIM_HEADERS setting has been extended to allow removing       those headers only for certain from_is_list lists.  This feature must       be enabled by setting ALLOW_FROM_IS_LIST to Yes in mm_cfg.py.  See the       description of these settings in Defaults.py for more detail.  This       feature is experimental in 2.1.16, and it is subject to change or to       become just one of the two methods in a subsequent release. People       interested in this feature are encouraged to try it and report their       experiences to the mailman-users@python.org list.      - There is a new DISPLAY_HELD_SUMMARY_SORT_BUTTONS setting which if set       in mm_cfg.py will display a set of radio buttons in the admindb held       message summary to select how the held messages are sorted and grouped       for display. The exact setting determines the default grouping and       sorting.  See the description in Defaults.py for details.      - Setting digest_size_threshhold to zero now means no digests will be       sent based on size instead of a digest being sent with every post.       (LP: #558274)      - There is a new mm_cfg.py setting SUBSCRIBE_FORM_SECRET which will put       a dynamically generated, hidden hash in the listinfo subscribe form and       check it upon submission.  Setting this will prevent automated processes       (bots) from successfully POSTing web subscribes without first retrieving       and parsing the form from the listinfo page.  The form must also be       submitted no later than FORM_LIFETIME nor no earlier than       SUBSCRIBE_FORM_MIN_TIME after retrieval.  Note that enabling this will       break any static subscribe forms on your site.  See the description in       Defaults.py for more info.  (LP: #1082746)      - add_members now has an option to add members with mail delivery disabled       by admin.  (LP: #1070574)      - IncomingRunner now logs rejected messages to the vette log.       (LP: #1068837)      - The name of the mailmanctl master lock file is now congigurable via the       mm_cfg.py setting MASTER_LOCK_FILE.  (LP: #1082308)      - list_lists now has an option to list only lists with public archives.       (LP: #1082711)    Contributed programs      - A new import_majordomo_into_mailman.pl script has been contributed by       Geoff Mayes.  (LP: #1129742)      - A new "sitemap" bash script has been contributed by Tomasz Chmielewski       <mangoo@wpkg.org> to generate a sitemap.xml file of an installation's       public archives for submission to search engines.    i18n      - The Danish translation has been updated thanks to Tom Christensen.      - Fixed a string in the Czech message catalog.  (LP: #1234567)      - A Farsi (Persian) translation has been added thanks to Javad Hoseini and       Mahyar Moghimi.      - Fixed several misspelled or garbled string replacements in the Spanish       message catalog.  (LP: #1160138)      - pt_BR message catalog has two new and an updated message per Hugo Koji       Kobayashi.  (LP: #1138578)      - German message catalog has been updated per Ralf Hildebrandt.      - Corrected typo in templates/it/private.html.    Bug Fixes and other patches      - Fixed a crash in SpamDetect.py which caused messages with unparseable       RFC 2047 encoded headers to be shunted.  (LP: #1235101)      - Fixed cron/disabled to send a fresh cookie when notifying disabled       members.  (LP: #1203200)      - Added "message_id" to the interpolation dictionary for the Article.html       template.  (LP: #725498)      - Changed the admin GUI to report only the bad entries in a list of email       addresses if any are bad.  (LP: #558253)      - Added logging for template errors in HyperArch.py.  (LP: #558254)      - Added more explanation to the bad owner address message from       bin/newlist.  (LP: #1200763)      - Fixed a bug causing the admin web interface to fail CSRF checking if       the list name contains a '+' character.  (LP: #1190802)      - Fixed bin/mailmanctl -s to not remove the master lock if it can't be       determined to be truly stale.  (LP: #1189558)      - It is no longer possible to add 'invalid' addresses to the ban_list       and the *_these_nonmembers filters from the check boxes on the admindb       interface.  (LP: #1187201)      - Backported recognition for mail.ru DSNs and minor bug fixes from       lp:flufl.bounce.  (LP: #1074592, LP: #1079249 and #1079254)      - Defended against buggy web servers that don't include an empty       QUERY_STRING in the CGI environment.  (LP: #1160647)      - The Switchboard.finish() method now logs the text of the exception when       it fails to unlink/preserve a .bak file.  (LP: #1165589)      - The pending (un)subscriptions waiting approval are now sorted by email       address in the admindb interface as intended.  (LP: #1164160)      - The subscribe log entry for a bin/add_members subscribe now identifies       bin/add_members as the source.  (LP: #1161642)      - Fixed a bug where the Subject: of the user notification of a       bin/remove_members unsubscribe was not in the user's language.       (LP: #1161445)      - Fixed a bug where BounceRunner could create and leave behind zero length       bounce-events files.  (LP: #1161610)      - Added recognition for another Yahoo bounce format.  (LP: #1157961)      - Changed configure's method for getting Python's include directory from       distutils.sysconfig.get_config_var('CONFINCLUDEPY') to       distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc().  (LP: #1098162)      - Added an Auto-Generated: header to password reminders.  (LP: #558240)      - Fixed a bug where non-ascii characters in the real name in a subscription       request could throw a UnicodeEncodeError upon subscription approval and       perhaps in other situations too.  (LP: #1047100)      - The query fragments send_unsub_notifications_to_list_owner and       send_unsub_ack_to_this_batch will now assume default values if not set       in mass unsubscribe URLs.  (LP: #1032378)      - Replaced utf-8 encoded characters in newly added German templates with       HTML entities. (LP: #1018208)  2.1.15 (13-Jun-2012)    Security      - Strengthened the validation of email addresses.      - An XSS vulnerability, CVE-2011-0707, has been fixed.      - The web admin interface has been hardened against CSRF attacks by adding       a hidden, encrypted token with a time stamp to form submissions and not       accepting authentication by cookie if the token is missing, invalid or       older than the new mm_cfg.py setting FORM_LIFETIME which defaults to one       hour.  Posthumous thanks go to Tokio Kikuchi for this implementation       which is only one of his many contributions to Mailman prior to his       death from cancer on 14 January 2012.    New Features      - Added a password reminder button to the private archive login page.       Backported from the 2.2 branch.      - There is a new list attribute regular_exclude_ignore set from mm_cfg.py       DEFAULT_REGULAR_EXCLUDE_IGNORE.  This defaults to True even though the       prior behavior is equivalent to False.  A True setting will ignore an       exclude list if the poster is not a member of that list.  The False       setting can result in list members not receiving posts if the nonmember       post is not accepted by the exclude list.  Backported from 2.2 branch.      - Eliminated the list cache from the qrunners.  Indirect self-references       caused lists to never be dropped from the cache which in turn caused       the qrunners to grow very large in installations with many lists or       multiple large lists.  Bug #862683.      - The user options 'list my other subscriptions' page now indicates for       each list if the subscription is 'nomail' or 'digest'.  Bug #793669.      - A new list poster password has been implemented.  This password may only       be used in Approved: or X-Approved: headers for pre-approving posts.       Using this password for that purpose precludes compromise of a more       valuable password sent in plain text email.  Bug #770581.      - A new mm_cfg.py setting AUTHENTICATION_COOKIE_LIFETIME has been added.       If this is set to a non-zero value, web authentication cookies will       expire that many seconds following their last use.  Its default value is       zero to preserve current behavior.      - A new mm_cfg.py setting RESPONSE_INCLUDE_LEVEL has been added to control       how much of the original message is included in automatic responses to       email commands.  The default is 2 to preserve the prior behavior of       including the full message.  Setting this to 1 in mm_cfg.py will include       only the original headers, and 0 will include none of the original.  It       is recommended to set this to 0 in mm_cfg.py to minimize the effects of       backscatter.  Bug #265835.      - A new mm_cfg.py setting DEFAULT_RESPOND_TO_POST_REQUESTS has been added       to control the default for respond_to_post_requests for new lists.  It is       set to Yes for backwards compatibility, but it is recommended that       serious consideration be given to setting it to No.  Bug #266051.      - A new mm_cfg.py setting DISCARD_MESSAGE_WITH_NO_COMMAND has been added to       control whether a message to the -request address without any commands or       a message to -confirm whose To: address doesn't match VERP_CONFIRM_REGEXP       is responded to or just logged.  It defaults to Yes which is different       from prior behavior.  Bug #410236.      - Two new mm_cfg.py settings, BROKEN_BROWSER_WORKAROUND and       BROKEN_BROWSER_REPLACEMENTS, have been added to control escaping of       additional characters beyond the standard <, >, &, and " in the web UI.       See the documentation of these settings in Defaults.py.  The default       values for these settings result in no change from the prior release.       Bug #774588.    i18n      - Added some missing German templates from Egon Frerich.      - Added Greek translation from Antonis Limperis.      - A few errors in the Basque translation are fixed.  Bug #836861.      - Fixed a misspelling in the German invite.txt template.  Bug #815444.      - Fixed a missing format character in the Spanish translation.       Bug #670988.      - Thanks go to the following for updating translations for the changes in       this release.         Thijs Kinkhorst         Stefan FÃ¶rster         Fabian Wenk    Bug Fixes and other patches      - Fixed a bug that could send an admin notice of a held subscription with       the subject in the user's preferred language instead of the list's       preferred language and possibly not properly RFC 2047 encoded.       (LP: #998949)      - Fixed a possible CPU bound loop in OutgoingRunner if the attempt to       Connect to the SMTP server throws a socket.error.  (LP: #966531)      - Fixed a potential crash in the web UI if a language is removed from the       LC_DESCRIPTIONS dictionary.  (LP: #966565)      - Added an Auto-Submitted: header to invitations and (un)subscription       confirmation requests to reduce the possibility of an autoresponder       confirming the request.  (LP: #265831)      - Added javascript to the private.html and admlogin.html templates to       focus the cursor on the entry field.  (LP: #266054)      - Added CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to src/Makefile to support their use.       (LP: #637652)      - Stopped removing the trailing slash from the List-Archive: header URL.       (LP: #964190)      - A configured version of contrib/courier-to-mailman.py is now created in       build/contrib/courier-to-mailman.py.  (LP: #999250)      - Subscription disabled warnings are now sent without a Precedence:       header.  Bug #808821.      - Backported 2.2 branch fix for a problem in SpamDetect.py that could       cause header_filter_rules to fail to match RFC 2047 encoded headers.      - Fix for bug #629738 could cause a crash in the admindb details display       if the decoded message body contained characters not in the character       set of the list's preferred language.  Fixed.  Bug #910440.      - Added recognition for another Qmail bounce format.      - Fixed an erroneous seek in the Mailman.Mailbox.Mailbox.AppendMessage       method that could cause a corrupt mailbox for files opened 'w+'.       Bug #901957.      - A held message with a null sender caused a crash in the admindb       interface.  This is fixed by changing the sender to <missing>.       Bug #897103.      - Changed subject prefixing to allow for possible whitespace between an       'Re' and the following colon when determining how to add the prefix.       Bug #893290.      - Fixed a problem where topics regexps would not match RFC 2047 encoded       Keywords: and/or Subject: headers.  Bug #891676.      - Fixed misleading response to an email approval of a held message.       Bug #889968.      - Added masthead.txt to the list of templates that can be edited via the       web admin interface.  Bug #266805.      - Changed the way digest_footer is added to the RFC 1153 (plain) format       digest for RFC compliance.  Bug #887610.      - Fixed cron/checkdbs to report unsubscriptions waiting approval.       Bug #873821.      - The fix for BUG #266220 (sf1181161) has been enhanced so that if there       is a pathological HTML part such that the Approved: password text isn't       found, but it is found after stripping out HTML tags, the post is       rejected with an informative message.      - A bug that would cause reset of any new_member_options bits other than       the four displayed as checkboxes on the list admin General Options page       whenever the page was updated or bin/config_list attempted to update       new_member_options has been fixed.  Bug #865825.      - A problem with the logic avoiding unnecessarily reloading a current list       object from the config.pck arises if the list is updated by another       process within the same second that it was last read/written.  That can       cause the reading of latest version of the list to be skipped.  This has       been fixed.  Bug #862675.      - Fixed bin/export.py to accept case insensitive password schemes.       Bug #833134.      - Added Tokio Kikuchi's icons to the misc/ and installed icons/       directories.

Bug #770377.      - Added a logout link to the admindb interface and made both admin and       admindb logout effective for a site admin cookie if allowed.       Bug #769318.      - Replaced the old Mailman logos and icon that install to Mailman's icons       directory with the new ones.  If you copy these elsewhere on your       server, please copy these new ones.      - Changed bin/genaliases to only call the POSTFIX_*_CMD commands once when       MTA = 'Postfix'.  Bug #266408.      - Added a report of the affected members to the warnings issued when       setting a list with digest members digestable=No and when setting a list       with non-digest members nondigestable=no.  Bug #761232.      - Fixed a problem where content filtering could remove the headers from       an attached message/rfc822 part if the message in that part is       multipart/alternative and collapse_alternatives is Yes.  Bug #757062.      - Changed the subscribe CGI to strip leading and trailing whitespace from       the supplied email address.  Bug #745432.      - Changed the maximum number of arguments for the who command to be       considered administrivia from 2 to 1 to help avoid false positives.       Bug #739524.      - Added the list name as 'display-name' in added Sender: headers to help       mitigate Outlook et al 'on behalf of' displays.

Bug #714424.      - Issue an HTTP 404 status for private archive file not found.      - @listname entries in *_these_nonmembers are no longer case sensitive.       Bug #705715.      - Changed bin/rmlist to also remove heldmsg files for the removed list and       fixed a problem with removal of stale locks for the list.  Bug #700528.      - Fixed a bug where content filtering could leave a multipart message or       part with just one sub-part. These should be recast to just the sub-part.       Bug #701558.      - Fixed a bug that could erroneously handle posts from addresses in       *_these_nonmembers and send held/rejected notices to bogus addresses when       The From or other sender header is RFC 2047 encoded.  Bug #702516.      - Updated contrib/mm-handler-2.1.10 to better handle lists with names that       look like admin addresses.  Bug #697161.      - Added bounce recognition for a bogus Dovecot MDN.  Bug #693134.      - Fixed a problem where an emailed command in the Subject: header with a       non-ascii l10n of an 'Re:' prefix is ignored.  Bug #685261.      - Fixed a problem with approving a post by email when the body of the       approval mail is base64 encoded.  Bug #677115.      - Fixed the host name in the From: address of the owner notification from       bin/add_members.  Bug #666181.  2.1.14 (20-Sep-2010)    Security      - Two potential XSS vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed.    New Features      - A new feature for controlling the addition/replacement of the Sender:       header in outgoing mail has been implemented.  This allows a list owner       to set include_sender_header on the list's General Options page in the       admin GUI.  The default for this setting is Yes which preserves the prior       behavior of removing any pre-existing Sender: and setting it to the       list's -bounces address.  Setting this to No stops Mailman from adding or       modifying the Sender: at all.        Additionally, there is a new Defaults.py/mm_cfg.py setting       ALLOW_SENDER_OVERRIDES which defaults to Yes but which can be set to No       to remove the include_sender_header setting from General Options, and       thus preserve the prior behavior completely.      - Bounce processing has been enhanced so that if a bounce is returned to a       list from a non-member who is a member of a regular_include_list, the       bounce will be processed as a bounce for the included list.    i18n      - Fixed a missing format character in the German bin/mailmanctl docstring.      - Updated Dutch translation from Jan Veuger.      - Updated Japanese Translation from Tokio Kikuchi.      - Updated Finnish translation from Joni TÃ¶yrylÃ¤.      - Made a few corrections to some Polish templates.  Bug #566731.      - Made a minor change to the Chinese (China) message catalog.  Bug #545772.      - Changed a few DOCTYPE directives in templates for compliance.       Bug #500952 and Bug #500955.    Bug Fixes and other patches      - Made minor wording improvements and typo corrections in some messages.       Bug #426979.      - Fixed i18n._() to catch exceptions due to bad formats.  Bug #632660.      - Fixed admindb interface to decode base64 and quoted-printable encoded       message body excerpts for display.  Bug #629738.      - Fixed web CGI tracebacks to properly report sys.path.

Bug #610527.      - Changed fix_url to lock the list if not locked.  Bug #610364.      - Made a minor change to the English subscribeack.txt (welcome message)       template to emphasize that a password is only required to unsubscribe       *without confirmation*.      - Fixed an issue in admindb that could result in a KeyError and "we hit a       bug" response when a moderator acts on a post that had been handled by       someone else after the first moderator had retrieved it.  Bug #598671.      - Fixed a bug which would fail to show a list on the admin and listinfo       overview pages if its web_page_url contained a :port.  Bug # 597741.      - Fixed bin/genaliases to not throw TypeError when MTA = None.       Bug #587657.      - Provided the ability to specify in mm_cfg.py a local domain (e.g.       'localhost') for the local addresses in the generated virtual-mailman       when MTA = 'Postfix'.  See VIRTUAL_MAILMAN_LOCAL_DOMAIN in Defaults.py.       Bug #328907.      - Made a minor change to the removal of an Approved: pseudo-header from       a text/html alternative to allow for an inserted '\xA0' before the       password.      - Fixed Content Filtering collapse_alternatives to work on deeply nested       multipart/alternative parts.  Bug #576675.      - We now accept/remove X-Approved: and X-Approve: headers in addition to       Approved: and Approve: for pre-approving posts.  Bug #557750.      - Reordered the 'cancel' and 'subscribe' buttons on the subscription       confirmation web page so the default action upon 'enter' will be the       subscribe button in browsers that pick the first button.  Bug #530654.      - Fixed a bug in the admindb interface that could apply a moderator       action to a message not displayed.  Bug #533468.      - Added a traceback to the log message produced when processing the       digest.mbox throws an exception.      - Added a urlhost argument to the MailList.MailList.Create() method to       allow bin/newlist and the the create CGI to pass urlhost so the host       will be correct in the listinfo link on the emptyarchive page.       Bug #529100.      - Added the List-Post header to the default list of headers retained in       messages in the MIME digest.  Bug #526143.      - When daemonizing mailmanctl, we now ensure terminal files are closed.      - Fixed a bug in pipermail archiving that caused fallback threading by       subject to fail.  Bug #266572.      - We now give an HTTP 401 status for authentication failures from admin,       admindb, private, options and roster CGIs, and an HTTP 404 status from       all the CGIs for an invalid list name.      - Backported the listinfo template change from the 2.2 branch to fix       Bug #514050.      - Fixed a bug where going to an archives/private/list.mbox/list.mbox URL       would result in a munged URL if authentication was required. Bug #266164.      - Fixed a bug where check_perms would throw an OSError if an entry in       Mailman's lists/ directory was not a directory.  Bug #265613.      - Fixed a bug where a message with an Approved: header held by a handler       that precedes Approve (SpamDetect by default) would not have the       Approved: header removed if the held message was approved.  Bug #501739.  2.1.13 (22-Dec-2009)    i18n      - Updated Dutch message catalog from Jan Veuger.      - Added Asturian translation from Marcos Costales and the Asturian       Language Team.    Bug Fixes and other patches      - Added "white-space: pre-wrap" style for <pre> tag in archives.       Bug #266467.      - Added vette logging for rejected and discarded (un)subscribe requests.      - Fixed a bug in admindb.py that could erroneously discard an unsubscribe       request as a duplicate.      - Decoded RFC 2047 encoded message subjects for a few reports.       Bug #266428.      - Fixed the French, Spanish and Hebrew translations which improperly       translated the 'coding:' line in bin/config_list output.      - Fixed the auto-responder to treat messages to -confirm, -join, -leave,       -subscribe and -unsubscribe as requests rather than posts.  Bug #427962.      - Configure/make no longer builds Japanese and Korean codecs in       pythonlib if Python already has them.      - Inadvertently setting a null site or list password allowed access       to a list's web admin interface without authentication.  Fixed by       not accepting null passwords.      - Changed VERP_CONFIRM_REGEXP  in Defaults.py to work if the replying       MUA folds the To: header and in cases where the list name includes '+'.      - Fixed some paths in contrib/check_perms_grsecurity.py. Bug #411192.      - Replies to commands sent to list-request now come From: list-owner       instead of list-bounces.      - Mailman no longer folds long sub-part headers in multipart messages.       In addition, Mailman no longer escapes From_ lines in the body of       messages sent to regular list members, although MTA's may do it anyway.       This is to avoid breaking signatures per Bug #265967.      - XSS protection in the web interface went too far in escaping HTML       entities.  Fixed.      - Removed or anonymized additional headers in posts to anonymous lists.      - Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect threading of replies to archived       messages that arrive with timestamps in the same second.      - Scrubbed HTML attachments containing tab characters would get the tabs       replaced by a string of '&nbsp' without a semicolon.  Fixed.      - Caught a TypeError in content filtering, collapse alternatives that       occurred with a malformed message if a multipart/alternative part       wasn't multi-part.  Reported in comments to bug #266230.      - Fixed a few things in bin/update:       - Changed some old messages for more current meaning.       - Fixed qfiles update to not lose metadata from 2.1.5+ format entries.       - Fixed 2.0.x template migration to not die if the templates/ tree         contains subdirectories from a version control system.      - Fixed a bug that would show a list on the admin and listinfo overview       pages if its web_page_url host contained the current host as a       substring.  Bug #342162.      - Fixed a bug in Utils.canonstr() that would throw a UnicodeDecodeError       if the string contained an HTML entity > 255 and also characters in the       128-255 range.  Bug #341594.      - Added recognition for more bounces.      - Updated contrib/mmdsr to report preserved messages and to use mktemp to       create temp files.  2.1.12 (23-Feb-2009)    Bug fixes and other patches      - Fix compatibility with Python 2.6.      - Fixed a bug in admin.py which would result in chunked pages of the       membership list for members whose address begins with a non-alphanumeric       character to not be visible or retrievable.      - Changed ListAdmin.py to make rejected post messages From: the -owner       address instead of the -bounces address.      - With MTA = 'Postfix', if the STANZA END for a list being removed is       missing or munged, the remainder of the aliases and/or virtual-mailman       file is lost.  Fixed.      - Since Mailman 2.1.1, 2.0.x outstanding subscription and held message       requests have not been migrated properly.  This is fixed.       Bug #266106 (sf998384).      - Changed cron/gate_news to continue processing the remaining lists on       certain errors that can be caused by configuration of a particular list.       Bug #265941 (sf775100).      - Fixed a bug in AvoidDuplicates.py that caused it to fail if the address       in the To: or Cc: header differed in case from the case-preserved member       address.  Bug #297795.      - Fixed a problem in SecurityManager that caused it to not find the       cookie when CheckCookie was not given a user and the user in the cookie       had a %xx encoded character.  Bug # 299220.      - Fixed a minor fromusenet reporting issue in the contributed mmdsr       script.      - Fixed a minor issue in cron/gate_news that could cause a list's       watermark to not be completely updated.      - Fixed an issue that prevented editing the options.html template from       the web admin interface. SF Bug #2164798.      - Fixed a problem in Decorate which could throw a TypeError on conversion       to unicode of a header/footer that was already unicode because of       interpolating a unicode value.      - Fixed an issue where list creation would report bad owner email       instead of bad listname when the list name had non-ascii characters.       SF Bug #2126489.      - Fixed an issue where in some circumstances HyperArch.py would translate       ' at ' into the wrong language ultimately throwing a UnicodeDecodeError       when the translation was decoded with a different character set.       Bug #308152.      - Corrected a typo in Mailman/Gui/Privacy.py. Bug #309757.      - Changed the pattern used to recognize URLs in messages for the pipermail       archive in order to try to do a better job of making hyperlinks.       Bug #310124.      - Added missing --bare option to French translation of list_lists help.       Bug #312119.      - Fixed a long standing error that stopped relative hrefs from being       generated for links on Mailman's web pages.      - Changed the admindb interface so that when messages are rejected from       the summary page, the reject reason is the rejection message from the       Errors.HoldMessage subclass instead of the generic "No reason given".      - Fixed the admin Membership List Find member function so the 'letter'       links to a chunked result would still be limited to the Find member       search. SF patch #1532081.      - Changed scripts/driver to return a 405 status for non GET, POST, HEAD       methods. SF patch #1578756.      - Fixed a bug in admindb.py in the implementation of replacing "No Reason       Given" with the default rejection reason.  Bug #325016.      - Changed Gui/Topics.py to validate regexps in VERBOSE mode.  Bug #327008.      - Worked around a potential problem in HyperArch.py with unicode character       set arguments.  Bug #328353.      - Recognize a couple more bounces.      - Fixed a bug introduced in 2.1.11 which would attempt to store bounce info       for a member just deleted if bounce_you_are_disabled_warnings is zero.    i18n      - Updated Dutch, Catalan and Polish translations.    Miscellaneous      - Added Lindsay Haisley's courier_to_mailman.py to the contrib directory.      - Added John Dennis' (RedHat) FHS patch to the contrib directory.  2.1.11 (30-Jun-2008)    New Features      - Added a new cron/cull_bad_shunt script to cull and optionally       archive old entries from the bad and shunt queues. This is controlled       by new Defaults.py/mm_cfg.py settings BAD_SHUNT_STALE_AFTER (default       7 days) and BAD_SHUNT_ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY (default None) which determine       how long to keep bad and shunt queue entries and optionally, where to       archive removed entries.      - Prepended list name to bounce log unrecognized bounce messages.      - Added a new Defaults.py|mm_cfg.py setting ACCEPTABLE_LISTNAME_CHARACTERS       with default value '[-+_.=a-z0-9]'.  This Python regular expression       character class specifies the characters allowed in list names.  The       motivation for this is the fact that previously, a list named, e.g.,       xxx&yyy could be created and MTA aliases generated that would cause       The MTA to execute yyy as a command.  There is a possible security issue       here, but it is not believed to be exploitable in any meaningful way.    Bug fixes and other patches      - Changed the preservation of unparseable messages to be conditional on       the Defaults.py/mm_cfg.py setting of QRUNNER_SAVE_BAD_MESSAGES and       changed the queue directory in which messages are preserved from 'shunt'       to 'bad'.      - Fixed a bug introduced in 2.1.10 that caused some email subscribe       requests to be shunted (1966837).      - Fixed a problem with bin/update erroneously moving templates from       templates/xx to lists/xx if a list has the same name as a language       code.  Also fixed the absolute path to lists/ (1418670 ).      - Changed Utils.ValidateEmail to not allow specials (particularly ':')       in unquoted local parts (1956393).      - Changed bin/update to remove .bak files erroneously left behind in       qfiles/*/ by a 2.1.9 bug.      - Added 's' to %(listname) in templates/ia/admlogin.html and       templates/sl/help.txt (1682990).      - Use newer template variable for site-owner address in       templates/ko/newlist.txt and templates/ru/newlist.txt (1578766).      - Corrections to Spanish translation submitted by Wikimedia Foundation       (1433262) and Debian.      - Corrections to German translation submitted by Ralf Doeblitz (916196).      - Correction to French translation submitted by Maxime Carron (1588617).      - Correction to Portuguese translation submitted by Gabriel P. Silva       (1733057).      - Add #! line to fblast.py test script (1578740).      - Fixed unescaped '%' in templates/nl/newlist.txt (1719017).      - Changed non-ascii characters in some templates/*/*.html files to HTML       entities.      - Fixed a problem in Decorate.py that could result in a multipart       message with no part headers for the original body part (1991348).      - Improved recognition of some bounce messages.      - Rearranged calls to the list setBounceInfo() method in Bouncer.py       to accommodate MemberAdaptors that store bounce info outside the       list instance.      - Fixed CookHeaders.py which in some cases with new style prefixing       would insert an extra space between the prefix and the subject.      - Changed OldStyleMemberships.py to remove the member from one_last_digest       when changing from regular to digest delivery to avoid the possibility       of a duplicate digest in some circumstances.      - Patched Danish message catalog for proper use of HTML entities per       Jonas Smedegaard (1999966).      - Improved bounce loop detection and handling in BounceRunner.py.      - Merged the Catalan i18n from the Mailman Catalan Translation Team.      - German translation updated by Peer Heinlein.      - Added check for gateway_to_news before holding for ModeratedNewsgroup.      - At some point, cron/senddigests and bin/update were inadvertently       'preconfigured'. This has been fixed.      - Brazilian Portuguese translation updated by Diego Francisco       de Gastal Morales.      - Added 'listname' to the replacements for the archidxfoot.html template.    Miscellaneous      - Brad Knowles' mailman daily status report script updated to 0.0.18.  2.1.10 (21-Apr-2008)    Security      - The 2.1.9 fixes for CVE-2006-3636 were not complete.  In particular,       some potential cross-site scripting attacks were not detected in       editing templates and updating the list's info attribute via the web       admin interface.  This has been assigned CVE-2008-0564 and has been       fixed.  Thanks again to Moritz Naumann for assistance with this.      - There is a new mm_cfg.py/Defaults.py variable       OWNERS_CAN_CHANGE_MEMBER_PASSWORDS which controls whether the list       owner can change a member's password from the member's options page.       This defaults to No and should be changed to Yes only if list owners       are trusted to not change a member's password, log in as the member       and make global membership changes.    New Features      - Changed cmd_who.py to list all members if authorization is with the       list's admin or moderator password and to accept the password if the       roster is public.  Also changed the web roster to show hidden members       when authorization is by site or list's admin or moderator password       (1587651).      - Added the ability to put a list name in accept_these_nonmembers       to accept posts from members of that list (1220144).      - Added a new 'sibling list' feature to exclude members of another list       from receiving a post from this list if the other list is in the To: or       Cc: of the post or to include members of the other list if that list is       not in the To: or Cc: of the post (Patch ID 1347962).      - Added the admin_member_chunksize attribute to the admin General Options       interface (Bug 1072002, Partial RFE 782436).  Internationalization      - Added the Hebrew translation from Dov Zamir.  This includes addition of       a direction ('ltr', 'rtl') to the LC_DESCRIPTIONS table.  The       add_language() function defaults direction to 'ltr' to not break       existing mm_cfg.py files.      - Added the Slovak translation from Martin Matuska.      - Added the Galician translation from Frco. Javier Rial RodrÃ­guez.    Bug fixes and other patches      - Added bounce recognition for several additional bounce formats.      - Fixed CommandRunner.py to decode a quoted-printable or base64 encoded       message part (1829061).      - Fixed Scrubber.py to avoid loss of an implicit text/plain message part       with no Content-* headers in a MIME multipart message (759841).  Fixed       several other minor scrubber issues (1242450).      - Added Date and Message-ID headers to the confirm reply message that       Mailman adds to the admin notification (1471318).      - Fixed Cgi/options.py to not present the "empty" topic to user.      - Fixed Handlers/CalcRecips.py to not process topics if topics are       disabled for the list.  This caused users who had previously subscribed       to topics and elected to not receive non-matching posts to receive no       messages after topics were disabled for the list.      - Fixed MaildirRunner.py to handle hyphenated list names.      - Fixed a bug in MimeDel.py (content filtering) which caused       *_filename_extensions to not match if the extension in the message was       not all lower case.      - Fixed versions.py to not call a non-existant method when converting held       posts from Mailman 1.0.x lists.      - Added a test to configure to detect a missing python-devel package on       some RedHat systems.      - Fixed bin/dumpdb to once again be able to dump marshals (broken since       2.1.5) (963137).      - Worked around a bug in the Python email library that could cause Mailman       to not get the correct value for the sender of a message from an RFC       2231 encoded header causing spurious held messages.      - Fixed bin/check_perms to detect certain missing permissions on the       archives/private/ and archives/private/<list>/database/ directories.      - Improved exception handling in cron/senddigests.      - Changed the admindb page to not show the "Discard all messages marked       Defer" checkbox when there are only (un)subscribes and no held messages.       Also added a separator and heading for "Held Messages" like the ones for       "Subscribe Requests" and "Unsubscribe Requests".  Suppressed the       "Database Updated" message when coming from the login page.  Also       removed the "Discard all messages marked Defer" checkbox from the       details page where it didn't work (1562922, 1000699).      - Fixed admin.py so null VARHELP category is handled (1573393).      - Fixed OldStyleMemberships.py to preserve delivery statuses BYADMIN       and BYUSER on a straight change of address (1642388).  Also fixed a       bug that could result in a member key with uppercase in the domain.      - Fixed bin/withlist so that -r can take a full package path to a       callable.      - Removal of DomainKey/DKIM signatures is now controlled by Defaults.py       mm_cfg.py variable REMOVE_DKIM_HEADERS (default = No).  Also, if       REMOVE_DKIM_HEADERS = Yes, an Authentication-Results: header will be       removed if present.      - The DeprecationWarning issued by Python 2.5 regarding string exceptions       is supressed.      - format=flowed and delsp=yes are now preserved for message bodies when       message headers/footers are added and attachments are scrubbed       (1495122).      - Queue runner processing is improved to log and preserve for analysis in       the shunt queue certain bad queue entries that were previously logged       but lost.  Also, entries are preserved when an attempt to shunt throws       an exception (1656289).      - The admin Membership List pages have been changed in that the email       address which forms a part of the various CGI data keys is now       urllib.quote()ed. This allows changing options for and unsubbing an       address which contains a double-quote character, but it may require       changes to scripts that screen-scrape the web admin interface to       produce a membership list so they will report an unquoted address.      - The fix for bug 1181161 in 2.1.7 was incomplete.  The Approve(d): line       wasn't always found in quoted-printable encoded parts and was never       found in base64 encoded parts.  This is now fixed.      - Fixed a mail loop if a list owner puts the list's -bounces or -admin       address in the list's owner attribute (1834569).      - Fixed the mailto: link in archived messages to prefix the subject with       Re: and to put the correct message-id in In-Reply-To (1621278, 1834281).      - Coerced list name arguments to lower case in the change_pw, inject,       list_admins and list_owners command line tools (patch 1842412).      - Fixed cron/disabled to test if bounce info is stale before disabling       a member when the threshold has been reduced.      - It wasn't noted here, but in 2.1.9, queue runner processing was made       more robust by making backups of queue entries when they were dequeued       so they could be recovered in the event of a system failure.  This       opened the possibility that if a message itself caused a runner to       crash, a loop could result that would endlessly reprocess the message.       This has now been fixed by adding a dequeue count to the entry and       moving the entry aside and logging the fact after the third dequeue of       the same entry.      - Fixed the command line scripts add_members, sync_members and       clone_member to properly handle banned addresses (1904737).      - Fixed bin/newlist to add the list's preferred language to the list's       available_languages if it is other than the server's default language       (1906368).      - Changed the first URL in the RFC 2369 List-Unsubscribe: header to go       to the options login page instead of the listinfo page.      - Changed the options login page to not issue the "No address given" error       when coming from the List-Unsubscribe and other direct links.  Also       changed to remember the user's language selection when redisplaying the       page following an error.      - Changed cmd_subscribe.py to properly accept (no)digest without a       password and to recognize (no)digest and address= case insensitively.      - Fixed a problem where GuiBase._getValidValue() would truncate a       floating point Number type to an int if the value was a float instead       of a numeric string. This affected setting floating point values with       config_list.    Miscellaneous      - Brad Knowles' mailman daily status report script updated to 0.0.17.      - An updated mm-handler (mm-handler-2.1.10) that can help reduce       backscatter has been added to the contrib directory.  2.1.9 (12-Sep-2006)    Security      - A malicious user could visit a specially crafted URI and inject an       apparent log message into Mailman's error log which might induce an       unsuspecting administrator to visit a phishing site.  This has been       blocked.  Thanks to Moritz Naumann for its discovery.      - Fixed denial of service attack which can be caused by some       standards-breaking RFC 2231 formatted headers.  CVE-2006-2941.      - Several cross-site scripting issues have been fixed.  Thanks to Moritz       Naumann for their discovery.  CVE-2006-3636      - Fixed an unexploitable format string vulnerability.  Discovery and fix       by Karl Chen.  Analysis of non-exploitability by Martin 'Joey' Schulze.       Also thanks go to Lionel Elie Mamane.  CVE-2006-2191.    Internationalization      - New languages: Arabic, Vietnamese.    Bug fixes and other patches      - Fixed Decorate.py so that characters in message header/footer which       are not in the character set of the list's language are ignored rather       than causing shunted messages (1507248).      - Switchboard.py - Closed very tiny holes at the upper ends of queue       slices that could result in unprocessable queue entries.  Improved FIFO       processing when two queue entries have the same timestamp.  2.1.8 (15-Apr-2006)    Security      - A cross-site scripting hole in the private archive script of 2.1.7       has been closed.  Thanks to Moritz Naumann for its discovery.    Bug fixes and other patches      - Bouncers support added: 'unknown user', Microsoft SMTPSVC, Prodigy.net       and several others.      - Updated email library to 2.5.7 which will encode payload into qp/base64       upon setting.  This enabled backing out the scrubber related patches       including 'X-Mailman-Scrubbed' header in 2.1.7.      - Fix SpamDetect.py potential hold/reject loop problem.      - A warning message from email package to the stderr can cause error       in Logging because stderr may be detached from the process during       the qrunner run.  We chose not to output errors to stderr but to       the logs/error if the process is running under mailmanctl subprocess.      - DKIM header cleansing was separated from Cleanse.py and added to       -owner messages too.      - Fixes: Lose Topics when go directly to topics URL (1194419).       UnicodeError running bin/arch (1395683).  edithtml.py missing import       (1400128).  Bad escape in cleanarch.  Wrong timezone in list archive       index pages (1433673).  bin/arch fails with TypeError (1430236).       Subscription fails with some Language combinations (1435722).       Postfix delayed notification not recognized (863989).  2.1.7 (VERP)       mistakes delay notice for bounce (1421285).  show_qfiles: 'str'       object has no attribute 'as_string' (1444447).  Utils.get_domain()       wrong if VIRTUAL_HOST_OVERVIEW off (1275856).    Miscellaneous      - Brad Knowles' mailman daily status report script updated to 0.0.16.  2.1.7 (31-Dec-2005)    Security      - The fix for CAN-2005-0202 has been enhanced to issue an appropriate       message instead of just quietly dropping ./ and ../ from URLs.      - A note on CVE-2005-3573: Although the RFC2231 bug example in the CVE has       been solved in Mailman 2.1.6, there may be more cases where       ToDigest.send_digests() can block regular delivery.  We put the       send_digests() calling part in a try/except clause and leave a message       in the error log if something happened in send_digests().  Daily call of       cron/senddigests will provide more detail to the site administrator.      - List administrators can no longer change the user's option/subscription       globally.  Site admin can change these only if       mm_cfg.ALLOW_SITE_ADMIN_COOKIES is set to Yes.      - <script> tags are HTML-escaped in the edithtml CGI script.      - Since the probe message for disabled users may reach unintended       recipients, the password is excluded from sendProbe() and probe.txt.       Note that the default value of VERP_PROBE has been set to `No' from       2.1.6., thus this change doesn't affect the default behavior.    New Features      - Always remove DomainKey (and similar) headers from messages sent to the       list. (1287546)      - List owners can control the content filter behavior when collapsing       multipart/alternative parts to its first subpart.  This allows the       option of letting the HTML part pass through after other content       filtering is done.    Internationalization      - New language: Interlingua.    Bug fixes and other patches      - Defaults.py.in: SCRUBBER_DONT_USE_ATTACHMENT_FILENAME is set to True for       safer operation.      - Fixed the bug where Scrubber.py munges quoted-printable by introducing       the 'X-Mailman-Scrubbed' header which marks that the payload is       scrubber-munged.  The flag is referenced in ToDigest.py, ToArchive.py,       Decorate.py and Archiver.  A similar problem in ToDigest.py where the       plain digest is generated is also fixed.      - Fixed Syslog.py to write quopri encoded messages when it fail to write       8-bit characters.      - Fixed MTA/Postfix.py to check aliases group permission in check_perms       and fixed mailman-install document on this matter (1378270).      - Fixed private.py to go to the original URL after authorization       (1080943).      - Fixed bounce log score messages to be more consistent.      - Fixed bin/remove_members to accept no arguments when both --fromall and       --file= options are specified.      - Changed cgi-bin and mail wrapper "group not found" error message to be       more descriptive of the actual problem.      - The list's ban_list now applies to address changes, admin mass       subscribes and invites, and to confirmations/approvals of address       changes, subscriptions and invitations.      - quoted-printable and base64 encoded parts are decoded before passing to       HTML_TO_PLAIN_TEXT_COMMAND (1367783).      - Approve: header is removed from posts, and treated the same as the       Approved: header. (1355707)      - Fixed the removal of the line following Approve[d]: line in body of       post.  (1318883)      - The Approve[d]: <password> header is removed from all text/* parts in       addition the initial text/plain part.  It must still be the first       non-blank line in the first text/plain part or it won't be found or       removed at all. (1181161)      - Posts are now logged in post log file with the true sender, not       listname-bounces. (1287921)      - Correctly initialize and remember the list's default_member_moderation       attribute in the web list creation page. (1263213)      - PEP263 charset is added to the config_list output. (1343100)      - Fixed header_filter_rules getting lost if accessed directly and       authentication was needed by login page. (1230865)      - Obscure email when the poster doesn't set full name in 'From:' header.      - Preambles and epilogues are taken into account when calculating message       sizes for holding purposes. (Mark Sapiro)      - Logging/Logger.py unicode transform option. (1235567)      - bin/update crashes with bogus files. (949117)      - Bugs and patches: 1212066/1301983 (Date header in create/remove notice)  2.1.6 (30-May-2005)    Security      - Critical security patch for path traversal vulnerability in private       archive script  (CAN-2005-0202).      - Added the ability for Mailman generated passwords (both member and list       admin) to be more cryptographically secure.  See new configuration       variables USER_FRIENDLY_PASSWORDS, MEMBER_PASSWORD_LENGTH, and       ADMIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH.  Also added a new bin/withlist script called       reset_pw.py which can be used to reset all member passwords.  Passwords       generated by Mailman are now 8 characters by default for members, and 10       characters for list administrators.      - A potential cross-site scripting hole in the driver script has been       closed.  Thanks to Florian Weimer for its discovery.  Also, turn       STEALTH_MODE on by default.    Internationalization      - Chinese languages are now supported.  They have been moved from 'big5'       and 'gb' to 'zh_TW' and 'zh_CN' respectively for compliance to the IANA       spec.  Note, however, that the character sets were changed from 'Big5'       or 'GB2312' to 'UTF-8' to cope with the insufficient codecs support in       Python 2.3 and earlier.  You may have to install Chinese capable codecs       (like CJKCodecs) separately to handle the incoming messages which are in       local charsets, or upgrade your Python to 2.4 or newer.    Behavior or defaults changes      - VERP_PROBES is disabled by default.      - bin/withlist can be run without a list name, but only if -i is given.       Also, withlist puts the directory it's found in at the end of sys.path,       making it easier to run withlist scripts that live in $prefix/bin.      - bin/newlist grew two new options: -u/--urlhost and -e/--emailhost which       lets the user provide the web and email hostnames for the new mailing       list.  This is a better way to specify the domain for the list, rather       than the old 'mylist@hostname' syntax (which is still supported for       backward compatibility, but deprecated).    Compatibility      - Python 2.4 compatibility issue: time.strftime() became strict about the       'day of year' range.  (1078482)    New Features      - New feature: automatic discards of held messages.  List owners can now       set how many days to hold the messages in the moderator request queue.       cron/checkdb will automatically discard old messages.  See the       max_days_to_hold variable in the General Options and       DEFAULT_MAX_DAYS_TO_HOLD in Defaults.py.  This defaults to 0       (i.e. disabled). (790494)      - New feature: subject_prefix can be configured to include a sequence       number which is taken from the post_id variable.  Also, the prefix is       always put at the start of the subject, i.e. "[list-name] Re: original       subject", if mm_cfg.OLD_STYLE_PREFIXING is set No.  The default style       is "Re: [list-name]" if numbering is not set, for backward compatibility.       If the list owner is using numbering feature by "%d" directive, the new       style, "[list-name 123] Re:", is always used.      - List owners can now cusomize the non-member rejection notice from       admin/<listname>/privacy/sender page. (1107169)      - Allow editing of the welcome message from the admin page (1085501).      - List owners can now use Scrubber to get the attachments scrubbed (held       in the web archive), if the site admin permits it in mm_cfg.py.  New       variables introduced are SCRUBBER_DONT_USE_ATTACHMENT_FILENAME and       SCRUBBER_USE_ATTACHMENT_FILENAME_EXTENSION in Defaults.py for scrubber       behavior.  (904850)    Documentation      - Most of the installation instructions have been moved to a latex       document.  See doc/mailman-install/index.html for details.    Bug fixes and other patches      - Mail-to-news gateway now strips subject prefix off from a response       by a mail user if news_prefix_subject_too is not set.      - Date and Message-Id headers are added for digests. (1116952)      - Improved mail address sanity check.  (1030228)      - SpamDetect.py now checks attachment header.  (1026977)      - Filter attachments by filename extensions.  (1027882)      - Bugs and patches: 955381 (older Python compatibility), 1020102/1013079/       1020013 (fix spam filter removed), 665569 (newer Postfix bounce       detection), 970383 (moderator -1 admin requests pending), 873035       (subject handling in -request mail), 799166/946554 (makefile       compatibility), 872068 (add header/footer via unicode), 1032434       (KNOWN_SPAMMERS check for multi-header), 1025372 (empty Cc:), 789015       (fix pipermail URL), 948152 (Out of date link on Docs),  1099138       (Scrubber.py breaks on None part),  1099840/1099840 (deprecated %       insertion),  880073/933762 (List-ID RFC compliance),  1090439 (passwd       reminder shunted), 1112349 (case insensitivity in acceptable_aliases),       1117618 (Don't Cc for personalized anonymous list), 1190404 (wrong       permission after editing html)  2.1.5 (15-May-2004)      - The admindb page has a checkbox that allows you to discard all held       messages that are marked Defer.  On heavy lists with lots of spam holds,       this makes clearing them much faster.      - The qrunner system has changed to use only one file per message.       However the configuration variable METADATA_FORMAT has been removed, and       support for SAVE_MSGS_AS_PICKLES has been changed.  The latter no longer       writes messages as plain text.  Instead, they are stored as pickles of       plain strings, using the text pickle format.  This still makes them       non-binary files readable and editable by humans.        bin/dumpdb also works differently.  It will print out the entire pickle       file (with more verbosity) and if used with 'python -i', it binds msg to       a list of all objects found in the pickle file.        Removed from Defaults.py: PENDINGDB_LOCK_TIMEOUT,       PENDINGDB_LOCK_ATTEMPTS, METAFMT_MARSHAL, METAFMT_BSDDB_NATIVE,       METAFMT_ASCII, METADATA_FORMAT      - The bounce processor has been redesigned so that now when an address's       bounce score reaches the threshold, that address will be sent a probe       message.  Only if the probe bounces will the address be disabled.  The       score is reset to zero when the probe is sent.  Also, bounce events are       now kept in an event file instead of in memory.  This should help       contain the bloat of the BounceRunner.        New supporting variables in Defaults.py: VERP_PROBE_FORMAT,       VERP_PROBE_REGEXP        REGISTER_BOUNCES_EVERY is promoted to a Defaults.py variable.      - The pending database has been changed from a global pickle file, to a       unique pickle file per mailing list.      - The 'request' database file has changed from a marshal, to the more       secure pickle format.      - Disallow multiple password retrievals.      - SF patch #810675 which adds a "Discard all messages marked Defer" button       for faster admindb maintenance.      - The email package is updated to version 2.5.5.      - New language: Turkish.      - Bugs and patches: 869644, 869647 (NotAMemberError for old cookie data),       878087 (bug in Slovenian catalog), 899263 (ignore duplicate pending       ids), 810675 (discard all defers button)  2.1.4 (31-Dec-2003)      - Close some cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the admin pages       (CAN-2003-0965).      - New languages: Catalan, Croatian, Romanian, Slovenian.      - New mm_cfg.py/Defaults.py variable PUBLIC_MBOX which allows the site       administrator to disable public access to all the raw list mbox files       (this is not a per-list configuration).      - Expanded header filter rules under Privacy -> Spam Filters.  Now you can       specify regular expression matches against any header, with specific       actions tied to those matches.      - Rework the SMTP error handling in SMTPDirect.py to avoid scoring bounces       for all recipients when a permanent error code is returned by the mail       server (e.g. because of content restrictions).      - Promoted SYNC_AFTER_WRITE to a Default.py/mm_cfg.py variable and       make it control syncing on the config.pck file.  Also, we always flush       and sync message files.      - Reduce archive bloat by not storing the HTML body of Article objects in       the Pipermail database.  A new script bin/rb-archfix was added to clean       up older archives.      - Proper RFC quoting for List-ID descriptions.      - PKGDIR can be passed to the make command in order to specify a different       directory to unpack the distutils packages in misc.  (SF bug 784700).      - Improved logging of the origin of subscription requests.      - Bugs and patches: 832748 (unsubscribe_policy ignored for unsub button on       member login page), 846681 (bounce disabled cookie was always out of       date), 835870 (check VIRTUAL_HOST_OVERVIEW on through the web list       creation), 835036 (global address change when the new address is already       a member of one of the lists), 833384 (incorrect admin password on a       hold message confirmation attachment would discard the message), 835012       (fix permission on empty archive index), 816410 (confirmation page       consistency), 834486 (catch empty charsets in the scrubber), 777444 (set       the process's supplemental groups if possible), 860135 (ignore       DiscardMessage exceptions during digest scrubbing), 828811 (reduce       process size for list and admin overviews), 864674/864676 (problems       accessing private archives and rosters with admin password), 865661       (Tokio Kikuchi's i18n patches), 862906 (unicode prefix leak in admindb),       841445 (setting new_member_options via config_list), n/a (fixed email       command 'set delivery')  2.1.3 (28-Sep-2003)      Performance, Reliability, Security          - Closed a cross-site scripting exploit in the create cgi script.          - Improvements in the performance of the bounce processor.           Now, instead of processing each bounce immediately (which           can cause severe lock contention), bounce events are queued.           Every 15 minutes by default, the queued bounce events are           processed en masse, on a list-per-list basis, so that each           list only needs to be locked once.          - When some or all of a message's recipients have temporary           delivery failures, the message is moved to a "retry" queue.           This queue wakes up occasionally and moves the file back to           the outgoing queue for attempted redelivery.  This should           fix most observed OutgoingRunner 100% cpu consumption,           especially for bounces to local recipients when using the           Postfix MTA.          - Optional support for fsync()'ing qfile data after writing.           Under some catastrophic system failures (e.g. power lose),           it would be possible to lose messages because the data           wasn't sync'd to disk.  By setting SYNC_AFTER_WRITE to True           in Mailman/Queue/Switchboard.py, you can force Mailman to           fsync() queue files after flushing them.  The benefits are           debatable for most operating environments, and you must           ensure that your Python has the os.fsync() function defined           before enabling this feature (it isn't, even on all           Unix-like operating systems).      Internationalization          - New languages Ukrainian, Serbian, Danish, Euskara/Basque.          - Fixes to template lookup.  Lists with local overriding           templates would find the wrong template.          - .mo files (for internationalization) are now generated at           build time instead of coming as part of the source           distribution.      Documentation          - A first draft of member documentation by Terri Oda.  There           is also a Japanese translation of this manual by Ikeda Soji.      Archiver / Pipermail          - In the configuration variables PUBLIC_EXTERNAL_ARCHIVER, and           PRIVATE_EXTERNAL_ARCHIVER, %(hostname)s has been added to           the list of allowable substitution variables.          - The timezone is now taken into account when figuring the           posting date for an article.      Scripts / Cron          - Fixes to cron/disabled for NotAMemberError crashes.          - New script bin/show_qfiles which prints the contents of .pck           message files.  New script bin/discard which can be used to           mass discard held messages.          - Fixes to cron/mailpasswds to account for old password-less           subscriptions.          - bin/list_members has grown two new options: --invalid/-i           prints only the addresses in the member database that are           invalid (which could have snuck in via old releases);           --unicode/-u prints addresses which are stored as Unicode           objects instead of as normal strings.      Miscellaneous          - Fixes to problems in some configurations where Python wouldn't           be able to find its standard library.          - Fixes to the digest which could cause MIME-losing missing           newlines when parts are scrubbed via the content filters.          - In the News/Mail gateway admin page, the configuration variable           nntp_host can now be a name:port pair.          - When messages are pulled from NNTP, the member moderation checks           are short-circuited.          - email 2.5.4 is included.  This fixes an RFC 2231 bug, among           possibly others.          - Fixed some extra spaces that could appear in the List-ID header.          - Fixes to ensure that invalid email addresses can't be invited.          - WEB_LINK_COLOR in Defaults.py/mm_cfg.py should now work.          - Fixes so that shunted message file names actually match           those logged in log/errors.          - An improved pending action cookie generation algorithm has           been added.          - Fixes to the DSN bounce detector.          - The usual additional u/i, internationalization, unicode, and           other miscellaneous fixes.  2.1.2 (22-Apr-2003)      - New languages Portuguese (Portugal) and Polish.      - Many convenient constants have been added to the Defaults.py       module to (hopefully) make it more readable.      - Email addresses which contain 8-bit characters in them are now       rejected and won't be subscribed.  This is not the same as 8-bit       characters in the realname, which is still allowed.      - The X-Originating-Email header is removed for anonymous lists.       Hotmail apparently adds this header.      - When running make to build Mailman, you can specify $DESTDIR to       the install target to specify an alternative location for       installation, without influencing the paths stored in       e.g. Defaults.py.  This is useful to package managers.      - New Defaults.py variable DELIVERY_RETRY_WAIT which controls how       long the outgoing qrunner will wait before it retries a       tempfailure delivery.      - The semantics for the extend.py hook to MailList objects has       changed slightly.  The hook is now called before attempting to       lock and load the database.      - Mailman now uses the email package version 2.5.1      - bin/transcheck now checks for double-%'s      - bin/genaliases grew a -q / --quiet flag      - cron/checkdbs grew a -h / --help option.      - The -c / --change-msg option has been removed from bin/add_members      - bin/msgfmt.py has been added, taken from Python 2.3's Tools/i18n       directory.  The various .mo files are now no longer distributed       with Mailman.  They are generated at build time instead.      - A new file misc/sitelist.cfg which can be used with       bin/config_list provides a small number of recommended settings       for your site list.  Be sure to read it over before applying!       sitelist.cfg is installed into the data directory.      - Many bug fixes, including these SourceForge bugs closed and       patches applied: 677668, 690448, 700538, 700537, 673294, 683906,       671294, 522080, 521124, 534297, 699900, 697321, 695526, 703941,       658261, 710678, 707608, 671303, 717096, 694912, 707624, 716755,       661138, 716754, 716702, 667167, 725369, 726415   2.1.1 (08-Feb-2003)      Lots of bug fixes and language updates.  Also:      - Closed a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the user options page.      - Restore the ability to control which headers show up in messages       included in plaintext and MIME digests.  See the variables       PLAIN_DIGEST_KEEP_HEADERS and MIME_DIGEST_KEEP_HEADERS in       Defaults.py.      - Messages included in the plaintext digests are now sent through       the scrubber to remove (and archive) attachments.  Otherwise,       attachments would screw up plaintext digests.  MIME digests       include the attachments inline.  2.1 final (30-Dec-2002)      Last minute bug fixes and language updates.  2.1 rc 1 (24-Dec-2002)      Bug fixes and language updates.  Also,      - Lithuanian support has been added.      - bin/remove_members grew --nouserack and --noadminack switches      - configure now honors --srcdir  2.1 beta 6 (09-Dec-2002)      Lots and lots of bug fixes, and translation updates.  Also,      - ARCHIVER_OBSCURES_EMAILADDRS is now set to true by default.      - QRUNNER_SAVE_BAD_MESSAGES is now set to true by default.      - Bounce messages which were recognized, but in which no member       addresses were found are no longer forwarded to the list       administrator.      - bin/arch grew a --wipe option which first removes the entire old       archive before regenerating the new one.      - bin/mailmanctl -u now prints a warning that permission problems       could appear, such as when trying to delete a list through the       web that has some archives in it.      - bin/remove_members grew --nouserack/-n and -noadminack/-N options.      - A new script bin/list_owners has been added for printing out       list owners and moderators.      - Dates in the web version of archived messages are now relative       to the local timezone, and include the timezone names, when       available.  2.1 beta 5 (19-Nov-2002)      As is typical for a late beta release, this one includes the usual     bug fixes, tweaks, and massive new features (just kidding).      IMPORTANT: If you are using Pipermail, and you have any archives     that were created or added to in 2.1b4, you will need to run     bin/b4b5-archfix, followed by bin/check_perms to fix some serious     performance problems.  From you install directory, run     "bin/b4b5-archfix --help" for details.      - The personalization options have been tweaked to provide more       control over mail header and decoration personalizations.  In       2.1b4, when personalization was enabled, the To and Cc headers       were always overwritten.  But that's usually not appropriate for       anything but announce lists, so now these headers aren't changed       unless "Full personalization" is enabled.      - You now need to go to the General category to enable emergency       moderation.      - The order of the hold modules in the GLOBAL_PIPELINE has       changed, again.  Now Moderate comes before Hold.      - Estonian language support has been added.      - All posted messages should now get decorated with headers and       footers in a MIME-safe way.  Previously, some MIME type messages       didn't get decorated at all.      - bin/arch grew a -q/--quiet option      - bin/list_lists grew a -b/--bare option  2.1 beta 4 (26-Oct-2002)      The usual assortment of bug fixes and language updates, some u/i     tweaks, as well as the following:      - Configuring / building / installing         o Tightened up some configure checks; it will now bark loudly           if you don't have the Python distutils package available           (some Linux distros only include distutils in their "devel"           packages).          o Mailman's username/group security assertions are now done by           symbolic name instead of numeric id.  This provides a level           of indirection that makes it much easier to move or package           Mailman.  --with-mail-gid and --with-cgi-gid are retained,           but they control the group names used instead.      - Command line scripts         o A new script, bin/transcheck that language teams can use to           check their .po files.          o bin/list_members grew a --fullnames/-f option to print the           full names along with the addresses.          o cron/senddigests grew --help/-h and --listname/-l options.          o bin/fix_url.py grew some command line options to support moving           a list to a specific virtual domain.      - Pipermail / archiving         o Reworked the directory layout for archive attachments to be           less susceptible to inode overload.  Attachments are now           placed in            archives/private/<listname>/attachments/<YYYYMMDD>/<msgidhash>          o Internationalization support in the archiver has been improved.      - Internationalization         o New languages: Swedish.      - Mail handling         o Content filtering now has a pass_mime_type variable, which           is a whitelist of MIME types to allow in postings.  See the           details of the variable in the Content Filtering category           for more information.          o If a member has enabled their DontReceiveDuplicates option,           we'll also strip their addresses from the Cc headers in the           copy of the message sent to the list.  This helps keep the           Cc lines from growing astronomically.          o Bounce messages are now forwarded to the list administrators           both if they are unrecognized, and if no list member's           address could be extracted.          o Content filtering now has a filter_action variable which           controls what happens when a message matches the content           filter rules.  The default is still to discard the message.          o When searching for an Approve/Approved header, the first           non-whitespace line of the body of the message is also           checked, if the body has a MIME type of text/plain.          o If a list is personalized, and the list's posting address is           not included in a Reply-To header, the posting address is           copied into a Cc header, otherwise there was no (easy) way a           recipient could reply back to the list.          o Added a MS Exchange bounce recognizer.          o New configuration variable news_moderation which allows the           mail->news gateway to properly post to moderated newsgroups.          o Messages sent to a list's owners now comes from the site           list to prevent mail loops when list owners or moderators           having bouncing addresses.      - Miscellaneous         o mailanctl prevents runaway restarts by imposing a maximum           restart value (defaulting to 10) for restarting the           qrunners.  If you hit this limit, do "mailmanctl stop"           followed by "mailmanctl start".          o The Membership Management page's search feature now includes           searching on members real names.          o The start of a manual for list administrators is given in           Python HOWTO format (LaTeX).  It's in doc/mailman-admin.tex           but it still needs lots of fleshing out.          o More protections against creating a list with an invalid name.  2.1 beta 3 (09-Aug-2002)      The usual assortment of bug fixes and language updates.      - New languages: Dutch, Portuguese (Brazil)      - New configure script options: --with-mailhost, --with-urlhost,       --without-permcheck.  See ./configure --help for details.      - The encoding of Subject: prefixes is controlled by a new list       option encode_ascii_prefixes.  This is useful for languages with       character sets other than us-ascii.  See the Languages admin       page for details.      - A new list option news_prefix_subject_too controls whether       postings gated from mail to news should have the subject prefix       added to their Subject: header.      - The algorithm for upgrading the moderation controls for a       Mailman 2.0.x list has changed.  The change should be       transparent, but you'll want to double check the moderation       controls after upgrading from MM2.0.x.  This should have no       effect for upgrades from a previous MM2.1 beta.        See the UPGRADING file for details.      - On the Mass Subscribe admin page, a text box has been added so       that the admin can add a custom message to be prepended to the       welcome/invite notification.      - On the admindb page, a link is included to more easily reload       the page.      - The Sendmail.py delivery module is sabotaged so that it can't be       used naively.  You need to read the comments in the file and       edit the code to use this unsafe module.      - When a member sends a `help' command to the request address,       the url to their options page is included in the response.      - Autoresponses, -request command responses, and posting hold       notifications are inhibited for any message that has a       Precedence: {bulk|list|junk} header.  This is to avoid mail       loops between email 'bots.  If the original message has an       X-Ack: yes header, the response is sent.        Responses are also limited to a maximum number per day, as       defined in the site variable MAX_AUTORESPONSES_PER_DAY.  This is       another guard against 'bot loops, and it defaults to 10.      - When a Reply-To: header is munged to include both the original       and the list address, the list address is always added last.      - The cron/mailpasswds script has grown a -l/--listname option.      - The cron/disabled script has grown options to send out       notifications for reasons other than bounce-disabled.  It has       also grown a -f/--force option.  See cron/disabled --help for       details.      - The bin/dumpdb script has grown a -n/--noprint option.      - An experimental new mechanism for processing incoming messages       has been added.  If you can configure your MTA to do qmail-style       Maildir delivery, Mailman now has a MaildirRunner qrunner.  This       may turn out to be much more efficient and scalable, but for       MM2.1, it will not be officially supported.  See Defaults.py.in       and Mailman/Queue/MaildirRunner.py for details.  2.1 beta 2 (05-May-2002)      Lots of bug fixing, and the following new features and changes:      - A "de-mime" content filter feature has been added.  This       oft-requested feature allows you to specify MIME types that       Mailman should strip off of any messages before they're posted       to the list.  You can also optionally convert text/html to       text/plain (by default, through lynx if it's available).      - Changes to the way the RFC 2919 and 2369 headers (i.e. the       List-*: headers) are added:           o List-Id: is always added           o List-Post:, List-Help:, List-Subscribe:,             List-Unsubscribe:, and List-Archive: are only added to             posting messages.           o X-List-Administrivia: is only added to messages Mailman             creates and sends out of its own accord.        Also, if the site administrator allows it, list owners can       suppress the addition of all the List-*: headers.  List owners       can also separately suppress the List-Post: header for       announce-only lists.      - A new framework for email commands has been added.  This allows       you to easily add, delete, or change the email commands that       Mailman understands, on a per-site, per-list, or even per-user       basis.      - Users can now change their digest delivery type from MIME to       plain text globally, for all lists they are subscribed to.      - No language select pulldowns are shown if the list only supports       one language.      - More mylist-admin eradication.      - Several performance improvements in the bounce qrunner, one of       which is to make it run only once per minute instead of once per       second.      - Korean language support as been added.      - Gatewaying from news -> mail uses its connections to the nntpd       more efficiently.      - In bin/add_members, -n/--non-digest-members-file command line       switch is deprecated in favor of -r/--regular-members-file.      - bin/sync_members grew a -g/--goodbye-msg switch.  2.1 beta 1 (16-Mar-2002)      In addition to the usual bug fixes, performance improvements, and     GUI changes, here are the highlights:      - MIME and other message handling         o More robustness against badly MIME encapsulated messages: if           a MessageParseError is raised during the initial parse, the           message can either be discarded or saved in qfiles/bad,           depending on the value of the new configuration variable           QRUNNER_SAVE_BAD_MESSAGES.          o There is a new per-user option that can be used to avoid           receipt of extra copies, when a member of the list is also           explicitly CC'd.          o Always add an RFC 2822 Date: header if missing, since not           all MTAs insert one automatically.          o The Sender: and Errors-To: headers are no longer added to           outgoing messages.          o Headers and footers are always added by concatenation, if           the message is not MIME and if the list's charset is a           superset of us-ascii.      - List administration         o An `invitation' feature has been added.  This is selectable           as a radio button on the mass subscribe page.  When           selected, users are invited to join instead of immediately           joined, i.e. they get a confirmation message.          o You can now enable and disable list owner notifications for           disabled-due-to-bouncing and removal-due-to-bouncing           actions.  The site config variables           DEFAULT_BOUNCE_NOTIFY_OWNER_ON_DISABLE and           DEFAULT_BOUNCE_NOTIFY_OWNER_ON_REMOVAL control the default           behavior.          o List owners can now decide whether they receive unrecognized           bounce messages or not (i.e. messages that the bounce           processor doesn't recognize).  Site admins can set the           default value for this flag with the config variable           DEFAULT_BOUNCE_UNRECOGNIZED_GOES_TO_LIST_OWNER.          o The admindb summary page gives the option of clearing the           moderation flag of members who are on quarantined.          o The action to take when a moderated member posts to a list           is now configurable.  The message can either be held,           rejected (bounced), or discarded.  If the message is           rejected, a rejection notice string can be given.          o In the General admin page, you can now set the default value           for five per-user flags: concealing the user's email           address, acknowledging posts sent by the user, copy           suppression, not-me-too selection, and the default digest           type.  Site admins can set the default bit field with the           new DEFAULT_NEW_MEMBER_OPTIONS variable.          o A new "Emergency brake" feature for turning on moderation of           all list postings.  This is useful for when flamewars break           out, and the list needs a cooling off period.  Messages           containing an Approved: header with the list owner password           are still allowed through, as are messages approved through           the admindb interface.          o When a moderated message is approved for the list, add an           X-Mailman-Approved-At: header which contains the timestamp           of the approval action (changed from X-Moderated: with a           different format).          o Lists can now be converted to using a less error prone           mechanism for variable substitution syntax in headers and           footers.  Instead of %(var)s strings, you'd use $var           strings.  You must use "bin/withlist -r convert" to enable           this.          o When moderating held messages, the header text box and the           message excerpt text box are now both read-only.          o You can't delete the site list through the web.          o When creating new lists through the web, you have the option           of setting the "default member moderation" flag.      - Security and privacy         o New feature: banned subscription addresses.  Privacy           options/subscription rules now have an additional list box           which can contain addresses or regular expressions.           Subscription requests from any matching address are           automatically rejected.          o Membership tests which compare message headers against list           rosters are now more robust.  They now check, by default           these header in order: From:, unixfrom, Reply-To:, Sender:.           If any match, then the membership test succeeds.          o ALLOW_SITE_ADMIN_COOKIES is a new configuration variable           which says whether to allow AuthSiteAdmin cookies or not.           Normally, when a list administrator logs into a list with           the site password, they are issued a cookie that only allows           them to do administration for this one list.  By setting           ALLOW_SITE_ADMIN_COOKIES to 1, the user only needs to           authenticate to one list with the site password, and they           can administer any mailing list.            I'm not sure this feature is wise, so the default value for           ALLOW_SITE_ADMIN_COOKIES is 0.          o Marc MERLIN's new recipes for secure Linuxes have been           updated.          o DEFAULT_PRIVATE_ROSTER now defaults to 1.          o Passwords are no longer included in the confirmation pages.      - Internationalization         o With the approval of Tamito KAJIYAMA, the Japanese codecs           for Python are now included automatically, so you don't need           to download and install these separate.  It is installed in           a Mailman-specific place so it won't affect your larger           Python installation.          o The configure script will produce a warning if the Chinese           codes are not installed.  This is not a fatal error.          o Russian templates and catalogs have been added.          o Finnish templates and catalogs have been added.      - Scripts and utilities         o New program bin/unshunt to safely move shunted messages back           into the appropriate processing queue.          o New program bin/inject for sending a plaintext message into           the incoming queue from the command line.          o New cron script cron/disabled for periodically culling the           disabled membership.          o bin/list_members has grown some new command line switches           for filtering on different criteria (digest mode, disable           mode, etc.)          o bin/remove_members has grown the --fromall switch.          o You can now do a bin/rmlist -a to remove an archive even           after the list has been deleted.          o bin/update removes the $prefix/Mailman/pythonlib directory.          o bin/withlist grows a --all/-a flag so the --run/-r option           can be applied to all the mailing lists.  Also, interactive           mode is now the default if -r isn't used.  You don't need to           run this script as "python -i bin/withlist" anymore.          o There is a new script contrib/majordomo2mailman.pl which           should ease the transition from Majordomo to Mailman.      - MTA integration         o Postfix integration has been made much more robust, but now           you have to set POSTFIX_ALIAS_CMD and POSTFIX_MAP_CMD to           point to the postalias and postmap commands respectively.          o VERP-ish delivery has been made much more efficient by           eliminating extra disk copies of messages for each recipient           of a VERP delivery.  It has also been made more robust in           the face of failures during chunk delivery.  This required a           rewrite of SMTPDirect.py and one casualty of that rewrite           was the experimental threaded delivery.  It is no longer           supported (but /might/ be resurrected if there's enough           demand -- or a contributed patch :).          o A new site config variable SMTP_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_CONNECTION           specifies how many consecutive SMTP sessions will be           conducted down the same socket connection.  Some MTAs have a           limit on this.          o Support for VERP-ing confirmation messages.  These are less           error prone since the Subject: header doesn't need to be           retained, and they allow a more user friendly (and i18n'd)           Subject: header.  VERP_CONFIRM_FORMAT, VERP_CONFIRM_REGEXP,           and VERP_CONFIRMATIONS control this feature (only supported           for invitation confirmations currently, but will be expanded           to the other confirmations).          o Several new list-centric addresses have been added:           -subscribe and -unsubscribe are synonyms for -join and           -leave, respectively.  Also -confirm has been added to           support VERP'd confirmations.      - Archiver         o There's now a default page for the Pipermail archive link           for when no messages have yet been posted to the list.          o Just the mere presence of an X-No-Archive: is enough to           inhibit archiving for this message; the value of the header           is now ignored.      - Configuring, building, installing         o Mailman now has a new favicon, donated by Terry Oda.  Not           all web pages are linked to the favicon yet though.          o The add-on email package is now distributed and installed           automatically, so you don't need to do this.  It is           installed in a Mailman-specific place so it won't affect           your larger Python installation.          o The default value of VERP_REGEXP has changed.          o New site configuration variables BADQUEUE_DIR and           QRUNNER_SAVE_BAD_MESSAGES which describe where to save           messages which are not properly MIME encoded.          o configure should be more POSIX-ly conformant.          o The Mailman/pythonlib directory has been removed, but a new           $prefix/pythonlib directory has been added.          o Regression tests are now installed.          o The second argument to add_virtual() calls in mm_cfg.py are           now optional.          o DEFAULT_FIRST_STRIP_REPLY_TO now defaults to 0.          o Site administrators can edit the Mailman/Site.py file to           customize some filesystem layout policies.   2.1 alpha 4 (31-Dec-2001)      - The administrative requests database page (admindb) has been       redesigned for better usability when there are lots of held       postings.  Changes include:         o A summary page which groups held messages by sender email           address.  On this page you can dispose of all the sender's           messages in one action.  You can also view the details of           all the sender's messages, or the details of a single           message.  You can also add the sender to one of the list's           sender filters.          o A details page where you can view all messages, just those           for a particular sender, or just a single held message.           This details page is laid out the same as the old admindb           page.          o The instructions have been shorted on the summary and           details page, with links to more detailed explanations.      - Bounce processing         o Mailman now keeps track of the reason a member's delivery           has been disabled: explicitly by the administrator,           explicitly by the user, by the system due to excessive           bounces, or for (legacy) unknown reasons.          o A new bounce processing algorithm has been implemented (we           might actually understand this one ;).  When an address           starts bouncing, the member gets a "bounce score".  Hard           (fatal) bounces score 1.0, while soft (transient) bounces           score 0.5.            List administrators can specify a bounce threshold above           which a member gets disabled.  They can also specify a time           interval after which, if no bounces are received from the           member, the member's bounce score is considered stale and is           thrown away.          o A new cron script, cron/disabled, periodically sends           notifications to members who are bounce disabled.  After a           certain number of warnings the member is deleted from the           list.  List administrators can control both the number of           notifications and the amount of time between notifications.            Notifications include a confirmation cookie that the member           can use to re-enable their subscription, via email or web.          o New configuration variables to support the bounce processing           are DEFAULT_BOUNCE_SCORE_THRESHOLD,           DEFAULT_BOUNCE_INFO_STALE_AFTER,           DEFAULT_BOUNCE_YOU_ARE_DISABLED_WARNINGS,           DEFAULT_BOUNCE_YOU_ARE_DISABLED_WARNINGS_INTERVAL.      - Privacy and security         o Sender filters can now be regular expressions.  If a line           starts with ^ it is taken as a (raw string) regular           expression, otherwise it is a literal email address.          o Fixes in 2.0.8 ported forward: prevent cross-site scripting           exploits.      - Mail delivery         o Aliases have all been changed so that there's more           consistency between the alias a message gets delivered to,           and the script & queue runner that handles the message.            I've also renamed the mail wrapper script to `mailman' from           `wrapper' to avoid collisions with other MLM's.  You /will/           need to regenerate your alias files with bin/genaliases, and           you may need to update your smrsh (Sendmail) configs.a            Bounces always go to listname-bounces now, since           administration has been separated from bounce processing.           listname-admin is obsolete.          o VERP support!  This greatly improves the accuracy of bounce           detection.  Configuration variables which control this feature           include VERP_DELIVERY_INTERVAL, VERP_PERSONALIZED_DELIVERIES,           VERP_PASSWORD_REMINDERS, VERP_REGEXP, and VERP_FORMAT.  The           latter two must be tuned to your MTA.          o A new alias mailman-loop@dom.ain is added which directs all           output to the file $prefix/data/owner-bounces.mbox.  This is           used when sending messages to the site list owners, as the           final fallback for bouncing messages.          o New configuration variable POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS           which should be set if you are using the Postfix MTA and           want Mailman to play nice with Postfix-style virtual           domains.      - Miscellaneous         o Better interoperability with Python 2.2.          o MailList objects now record the date (in seconds since           epoch) that they were created.  This is in a hidden           attribute `created_at'.          o bin/qrunner grows a -s/--subproc switch which is usually           used only when it's started from mailmanctl.          o bin/newlist grows a -l/--language option so that the list's           preferred language can be set from the command line.          o cron changes: admin reminders go out at 8am local time instead           of 10pm local time.      - Pipermail archiver         o MIME attachments are scrubbed out into separate files which           can be viewed by following a link in the original article.           Article contains an indication of the size of the           attachment, its type, and other useful information.          o New script bin/cleanarch which can be used to `clean' an           .mbox archive file by fixing unescaped embedded Unix From_           lines.          o New configuration variable ARCHIVE_SCRUBBER in           Defaults.py.in which names the module that Pipermail should           use to scrub articles of MIME attachments.          o New configuration variable ARCHIVE_HTML_SANITIZER which           describes how the scrubber should handle text/html           attachments.          o PUBLIC_ARCHIVE_URL has change its semantics.  It is now an           absolute url, with the hostname and listname parts           interpolated into it on a per-list basis.          o Pipermail should now provide the proper character set in the           Content-Type: header for archived articles.      - Internationalization         o Czech translations by Dan Ohnesorg.          o The Hungarian charset has be fixed to be iso-8859-2.          o The member options login page now has a language selection           widget.      - Building, configuration         o email-0.96 package is required (see the misc directory).          o New recipes for integrating Mailman and Sendmail,           contributed by David Champion.   2.1 alpha 3 (22-Oct-2001)      - Realname support         o Mailman now tracks a member's Real Name in addition to their           email address.          o List members can now supply their Real Names when           subscribing via the web.  Their Real Names are parsed from           any thru-email subscriptions.          o Members can change their Real Names on their options page,           and admins can change members' Real Names on the membership           pages.  Mass subscribing accepts "email@dom.ain (Real Name)"           and "Real Name <email@dom.ain>" entries, for both           in-text-box and file-upload mass subscriptions.      - Filtering and Privacy         o Reply-To: munging has been enhanced to allow a wider range           of list policies.  You can now pre-strip any Reply-To:           headers before adding list-specific ones (i.e. you can           override or extend existing Reply-To: headers).  If           stripping, the old headers are no longer saved on           X-Reply-To:          o New sender moderation rules.  The old `posters',           `member_only_posting', `moderated' and `forbidden_posters'           options have been removed in favor of a new moderation           scheme.  Each member has a personal moderation bit, and           non-member postings can be automatically accepted, held for           approval, rejected (bounced) or discarded.          o When membership rosters are private, responses to           subscription (and other) requests are made more generic so           that these processes can't be covertly mined for hidden           addresses.  If a subscription request comes in for a user           who is already subscribed, the user is notified of potential           membership mining.          o When a held message is approved via the admindb page, an           X-Moderated: header is added to the message.          o List admins can now set an unsubscribe policy which requires           them to approve of member unsubscriptions.      - Web U/I         o All web confirmations now require a two-click procedure,           where the first click gives them a page that allows them to           confirm or cancel their subscription.  It is bad form for an           email click (HTTP GET) to have side effects.          o Lots of improvements for clarity.          o The Privacy category has grown three subcategories.          o The General options page as a number of subsection headers.          o The Passwords and Languages categories are now on separate           admin pages.          o The admin subcategories are now formated as two columns in           the top and bottom legends.          o When creating a list through the web, you can now specify           the initial list of supported languages.          o The U/I for unsubscribing a member on the admin's membership           page should be more intuitive now.          o There is now a separate configuration option for whether the           goodbye_msg is sent when a member is unsubscribed.      - Performance         o misc/mailman is a Unix init script, appropriate for           /etc/init.d, and containing chkconfig hooks for systems that           support it.          o bin/mailmanctl has been rewritten; the `restart' command           actually works now.  It now also accepts -s, -q, and -u           options.          o bin/qrunner has been rewritten too; it can serve the role of           the old cron/qrunner script for those who want classic           cron-invoked mail delivery.          o Internally, messages are now stored in the qfiles directory           primarily as pickles.  List configuration databases are now           stored as pickles too (i.e. config.pck).  bin/dumpdb knows           how to display both pickles and marshals.      - Mail delivery         o If a user's message is held for approval, they are sent a           notification message containing a confirmation cookie.  They           can use this confirmation cookie to cancel their own           postings (if they haven't already been approved).          o When held messages are forwarded to an explicit address           using the admindb page, it is done so  in a message/rfc822           encapsulation.          o When a message is first held for approval, the notification           sent to the list admin is a 3-part multipart/mixed.  The           first part holds the notification message, the second part           hold the original message, and the third part hold a cookie           confirmation message, to which the admin can respond to           approve or discard the message via email.          o In the mail->news gateway, you can define mail headers that           must be modified or deleted before the message can be posted           to the nntp server.          o The list admin can send an immediate urgent message to the           entire list membership, bypassing digest delivery.  This is           done by adding an Urgent: header with the list password.           Urgent messages with an invalid password are rejected.          o Lists can now optionally personalize email messages, if the           site admin allows it.  Personalized messages mean that the           To: header includes the recipient's address instead of the           list's address, and header and footer messages can contain           user-specific information.  Note that only regular           deliveries can currently be personalized.          o Message that come from Usenet but that have broken MIME           boundaries are ignored.          o If the site administrator agrees, list owners have the           ability to disable RFC 2369 List-* headers.          o There is now an API for an external process to post a           message to a list.  This posting process can also specify an           explicit list of recipients, in effect turning the mailing           list into a "virtual list" with a fluid membership.  See           Mailman/Post.py for details.      - Building/testing/configuration         o mimelib is no longer required, but you must install the           email package (see the tarball in the misc directory).          o An (as yet) incomplete test suite has been added.  Don't try           running it in a production environment!          o Better virtual host support by adding a mapping from the           host name given in cgi's HTTP_HOST/SERVER_NAME variable to           the email host used in list addresses.  (E.g. www.python.org           maps to @python.org).          o Specifying urls to external public archivers is more           flexible.          o The filters/ subdirectory has been removed.          o There is now a `site list' which is a mailing list that must           be created first, and from which all password reminders           appear to come from.  It is recommended that this list be           called "mailman@your.site".          o bin/move_list is no longer necessary (see the FAQ for           detailed instructions on renaming a list).          o A new script bin/fix_url.py can be used with bin/withlist to           change a list's web_page_url configuration variable (since           it is no longer modifiable through the web).      - Internationalization         o Support for German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, and           Norwegian have been added.      - Miscellaneous         o Lots of new bounce detectors.  Bounce detectors can now           discard temporary bounce messages by returning a special           Stop value.          o bin/withlist now sports a -q/--quiet flag.          o bin/add_members has a new -a/--admin-notify flag which can           be used to inhibit list owner notification for each           subscription.      - Membership Adaptors         o Internally, mailing list memberships are accessed through a           MemberAdaptor interface.  This would allow for integrating           membership databases with external sources (e.g. Zope or           LDAP), although the only MemberAdaptor currently implemented           is a "classic" adaptor which stores the membership           information on the MailList object.          o There's a new pipeline handler module called FileRecips.py           which could be used to get all regular delivery mailing list           recipients from a Sendmail-style :include: file (see List           Extensibility bullet below).            This work was sponsored by Control.com      - List Extensibility         o A framework has been added which can be used to specialize           and extend specific mailing lists.  If there is a file           called lists/<yourlist>/extend.py, it is execfile()'d after           the MailList object is instantiated.  The file should           contain a function extend() which will be called with the           MailList instance.  This function can do all sorts of deep           things, like modify the handler pipeline just for this list,           or even strip out particular admin GUI elements (see below).          o All the admin page GUI elements are now separate           components.  This provides greater flexibility for list           customization.  Also, each GUI element will be given an           opportunity to handle admin CGI form data.            This work was sponsored by Control.com      - Topic Filters         o A new feature has been added called "Topic Filters".  A list           administrator can create topics, which are essentially           regular expression matches against Subject: and Keyword:           headers (including such pseudo-headers if they appear in the           first few lines of the body of a message).            List members can then `subscribe' to various topics, which           allows them to filter out any messages that don't match a           topic, or to filter out any message that does match a           topic.  This can be useful for high volume lists where not           everyone will be interested in every message.            This work was sponsored by Control.com  2.1 alpha 2 (11-Jul-2001)      - Building         o mimelib 0.4 is now required.  Get it from           http://mimelib.sf.net.  If you've installed an earlier           version of mimelib, you must upgrade.          o /usr/local/mailman is now the default installation           directory.  Use configure's --prefix switch to change it           back to the default (/home/mailman) or any other           installation directory of your choice.      - Security         o Better definition of authentication domains.  The following           roles have been defined: user, list-admin, list-moderator,           creator, site-admin.          o There is now a separate role of "list moderator", which has           access to the pending requests (admindb) page, but not the           list configuration pages.          o Subscription confirmations can now be performed via email or           via URL.  When a subscription is received, a unique (sha)           confirm URL is generated in the confirmation message.           Simply visiting this URL completes the subscription process.          o In a similar manner, removal requests (via web or email           command) no longer require the password.  If the correct           password is given, the removal is performed immediately.  If           no password is given, then a confirmation message is           generated.      - Internationalization         o More I18N patches.  The basic infrastructure should now be           working correctly.  Spanish templates and catalogs are           included, and English, French, Hungarian, and Big5 templates           are included.          o Cascading specializations and internationalization of           templates.  Templates are now search for in the following           order: list-specific location, domain-specific location,           site-wide location, global defaults.  Each search location           is further qualified by the language being displayed.  This           means that you only need to change the templates that are           different from the global defaults.            Templates renamed: admlogin.txt => admlogin.html           Templates added: private.html      - Web UI         o Redesigned the user options page.  It now sits behind an           authentication so user options cannot be viewed without the           proper password.  The other advantage is that the user's           password need not be entered on the options page to           unsubscribe or change option values.  The login screen also           provides for password mail-back, and unsubscription w/           confirmation.            Other new features accessible from the user options page           include: ability to change email address (with confirmation)           both per-list and globally for all list on virtual domain;           global membership password changing; global mail delivery           disable/enable; ability to suppress password reminders both           per-list and globally; logout button.            [Note: the handle_opts cgi has gone away]          o Color schemes for non-template based web pages can be defined           via mm_cfg.          o Redesign of the membership management page.  The page is now           split into three subcategories (Membership List, Mass           Subscription, and Mass Removal).  The Membership List           subcategory now supports searching for member addresses by           regular expression, and if necessary, it groups member           addresses first alphabetically, and then by chunks.            Mass Subscription and Mass Removal now support file upload,           with one address per line.          o Hyperlinks from the logos in the footers have been removed.           The sponsors got too much "unsubscribe me!" spam from           desperate user of Mailman at other sites.          o New buttons on the digest admin page to send a digest           immediately (if it's non-empty), to start a new digest           volume with the next digest, and to select the interval with           which to automatically start a new digest volume (yearly,           monthly, quarterly, weekly, daily).            DEFAULT_DIGEST_VOLUME_FREQUENCY is a new configuration           variable, initially set to give a new digest volume monthly.          o Through-the-web list creation and removal, using a separate           site-wide authentication role called the "list creator and           destroyer" or simply "list creator".  If the configuration           variable OWNERS_CAN_DELETE_THEIR_OWN_LISTS is set to 1 (by           default, it's 0), then list admins can delete their own           lists.            This feature requires an adaptor for the particular MTA           you're using.  An adaptor for Postfix is included, as is a           dumb adaptor that just emails mailman@yoursite with the           necessary Sendmail style /etc/alias file changes.  Some MTAs           like Exim can be configured to automatically recognize new           lists.  The adaptor is selected via the MTA option in           mm_cfg.py      - Email UI         o In email commands, "join" is a synonym for           "subscribe". "remove" and "leave" are synonyms for           "unsubscribe".  New robot addresses are support to make           subscribing and unsubscribing much easier:            mylist-join@mysite           mylist-leave@mysite          o Confirmation messages have a shortened Subject: header,           containing just the word "confirm" and the confirmation           cookie.  This should help for MUAs that like to wrap long           Subject: lines, messing up confirmation.          o Mailman now recognizes an Urgent: header, which, if it           contains the list moderator or list administrator password,           forces the message to be delivered immediately to all           members (i.e. both regular and digest members).  The message           is also placed in the digest.  If the password is incorrect,           the message will be bounced back to the sender.      - Performance         o Refinements to the new qrunner subsystem which preserves           FIFO order of messages.          o The qrunner is no longer started from cron.  It is started           by a Un*x init-style script called bin/mailmanctl (see           below).  cron/qrunner has been removed.      - Command line scripts         o bin/mailmanctl script added, which is used to start, stop,           and restart the qrunner daemon.          o bin/qrunner script added which allows a single sub-qrunner           to run once through its processing loop.          o bin/change_pw script added (eases mass changing of list           passwords).          o bin/update grows a -f switch to force an update.          o bin/newlang renamed to bin/addlang; bin/rmlang removed.          o bin/mmsitepass has grown a -c option to set the list           creator's password.  The site-wide `create' web page is           linked to from the admin overview page.          o bin/newlist's -o option is removed.  This script also grows           a way of spelling the creation of a list in a specific           virtual domain.          o The `auto' script has been removed.          o bin/dumpdb has grown -m/--marshal and -p/--pickle options.          o bin/list_admins can be used to print the owners of a mailing list.          o bin/genaliases regenerates from scratch the aliases and           aliases.db file for the Postfix MTA.      - Archiver         o New archiver date clobbering option, which allows dates to           only be clobber if they are outrageously out-of-date           (default setting is 15 days on either side of received           timestamp).  New configuration variables:            ARCHIVER_CLOBBER_DATE_POLICY           ARCHIVER_ALLOWABLE_SANE_DATE_SKEW            The archived copy of messages grows an X-List-Received-Date:           header indicating the time the message was received by           Mailman.          o PRIVATE_ARCHIVE_URL configuration variable is removed (this           can be calculated on the fly, and removing it actually makes           site configuration easier).      - Miscellaneous         o Several new README's have been added.          o Most syslog entries for the qrunner have been redirected to           logs/error.          o On SIGHUP, qrunner will re-open all its log files and           restart all child processes.  See "bin/mailmanctl restart".      - Patches and bug fixes         o SF patches and bug fixes applied: 420396, 424389, 227694,           426002, 401372 (partial), 401452.          o Fixes in 2.0.5 ported forward:             Fix a lock stagnation problem that can result when the             user hits the `stop' button on their browser during a             write operation that can take a long time (e.g. hitting             the membership management admin page).          o Fixes in 2.0.4 ported forward:             Python 2.1 compatibility release.  There were a few             questionable constructs and uses of deprecated modules             that caused annoying warnings when used with Python 2.1.             This release quiets those warnings.          o Fixes in 2.0.3 ported forward:             Bug fix release.  There was a small typo in 2.0.2 in             ListAdmin.py for approving an already subscribed member             (thanks Thomas!).  Also, an update to the OpenWall             security workaround (contrib/securelinux_fix.py) was             included.  Thanks to Marc Merlin.  2.1 alpha 1 (04-Mar-2001)      - Python 2.0 or newer required.  Also required is `mimelib' a new       library for handling MIME documents.  This will be bundled in       future releases, but for now, you must download and install it       (using Python's distutils) from        http://barry.wooz.org/software/Code/mimelib-0.2.tar.gz        You need mimelib 0.2 or better.      - Redesigned qrunner subsystem.  Now there are multiple message       queues, and considerable flexibility in file formats for       integration with external systems.  The current crop of queues       include:        archive -- for posting messages to an archiver       commands -- for incoming email commands and bounces       in -- for list-destined incoming email       news -- for messages outgoing to a nntp server       out -- for messages outgoing to a smtp server       shunt -- for messages that trigger unexpected exceptions in Mailman       virgin -- for messages that are generated by Mailman        cron/qrunner is now a long running script that forks off       sub-runners for each of the above queues.  qrunner still plays       nice with cron, but it is expected to be started by init at some       point in the future.  Some support exists for parallel       processing of messages in the queues.      - Support for internationalization support merged in.  Original       work done by Juan Carlos Rey Anaya and Victoriano Giralt.  I've       tested about 90% of the web side, 50% of the email, and 50% of       the command line / cron scripts.        New scripts: bin/newlang, bin/rmlang      - New delivery script `auto' for automatic integration with the       Postfix MTA.      - A bunch of new bounce detectors.      Changes ported from Mailman 2.0.2 and 2.0.1:      - A fix for a potential privacy exploit where a clever list       administrator could gain access to user passwords.  This doesn't       allow them to do much more harm to the user then they normally       could, but they still shouldn't have access to the passwords.      - In the admindb page, don't complain when approving a       subscription of someone who's already on the list (SF bug       #222409 - Thomas Wouters).        Also, quote for HTML the Subject: text printed for held       messages, otherwise messages with e.g. "Subject: </table>" could       royally screw page formatting.      - Docstring fix bin/newlist to remove mention of "immediate"       argument (Thomas Wouters).      - Fix for bin/update when PREFIX != VAR_PREFIX (SF bug #229794 --       Thomas Wouters).      - Bug fix release, namely fixes a buglet in bin/withlist affecting       the -l and -r flags; also a problem that can cause qrunner to       stop processing mail after disk-full events (SourceForge bug       127199).  2.0 final (21-Nov-2000)      No changes from rc3.  2.0 release candidate 3 (16-Nov-2000)      - By popular demand, Reply-To: munging policy is now to always       override any Reply-To: header in the original message, if       reply_goes_to_list is set to "This list" or "Explicit Address"      - bin/newlist given -q/--quiet flag instead of the <immediate>       positional argument      - Hopefully last fix to DEFAULT_URL not ending in a slash       sensitivity      - 2.0rc2 buglets fixed:         o newlist argument parsing         o updating with unlocked lists         o HyperArch.py traceback when there's no           Content-Transfer-Encoding: header      - SourceForge bugs fixed:         122358 (qmail-to-mailman.py listname case folding)      - SourceForge patches applied:         102373 (qmail-to-mailman.py listname case folding)  2.0 release candidate 2 (10-Nov-2000)      - Documentation updates: start in the doc/ directory.      - bin/withlist accepts additional command line arguments when used       with the --run flag; bin/mmsitepass and bin/newlist accept       -h/--help flags      - bin/newlist has a -o/--output flag to append /etc/aliases       suggestions to a specified file      - SourceForge bugs fixed:         116615 (README.BSD update), 117015 (duplicate messages on         moderated posts), 117548 (exception in HyperArch.py), 117682         (typos), 121185 (vsnprintf signature), 121591 and 122017         (bogus link after web unsubscribe), 121811 (`subscribe' in         Subject: doesn't get archived)      - SourceForge patches applied:         101812 (securelinux_fix.py contrib), 102097 (fix for bug         117548), 102211 (additional args for withlist), 102268 (case         insensitive Content-Transfer-Encoding:)  2.0 release candidate 1 (23-Oct-2000)      - Bug fixes and security patches.      - Better html rendition of articles in non us-ascii charsets       (Jeremy Hylton).  See VERBATIM_ENCODING variable in       Defaults.py.in for customization.  2.0 beta 6 (22-Sep-2000)      - Building         o Tested with Python 1.5.2, Python 1.6, and Python 2.0 beta 1.           Conducted on RH Linux 6.1 only, but should work           cross-platform.          o Configure now accepts --with-username, --with-groupname,           --with-var-prefix flags.  See `configure --help' or the           INSTALL file for details.          o Setting the CFLAGS environment variable before invoking           configure now works.          o The icons are now copied into $prefix/icons at install time.           Patch by David Champion.      - Standards         o Compliance with RFC 2369 (List-*: headers).  Patch by           Darrell Fuhriman.  List-ID: header is kept for historical           reasons.          o Fixes by Jeremy Hylton to Pipermail in support of non-ASCII           charsets, based on the Content-Type: and encoded-words in           the original message.  Mail headers are now decoded as per           RFC 2047.          o Many more bounce formats are detected: Microsoft's SMTPSVC,           Compuserve, GroupWise, SMTP32, and the more generic           SimpleMatch (which catches lots of similar but slightly           different formats).      - Defaults         o Email addresses can now be obscured in Pipermail archives by           setting mm_cfg.ARCHIVER_OBSCURES_EMAILADDRS to 1 (obscuring           is turned off by default).  Patch provided by Chris Snell.          o The default NNTP host can now be set by editing           mm_cfg.DEFAULT_NNTP_HOST.  Patch by David Champion.          o The default archiving mode (public/private) can now be set           by editing mm_cfg.DEFAULT_ARCHIVE.  Patch by Ted Cabeen.      - Web UI         o The variable details pages in the administrators interface           is now `live', i.e. there's a submit button on the details           page.          o A link to the administrative interface is placed in the           footer of the general user pages (authentication still           required, of course!)          o The user options change results page has a link back to the           user's main page.          o In the admindb page (for dealing with held postings), the           default forward address is now listname-owner instead of           listname-admin.  This avoids bounce detection on the           forwarded message.      - Miscellaneous         o Fixed config.db corruption problem when disk-full errors are           encountered.          o Command line scripts accept list names case-insensitively.          o bin/remove_members takes a -a flag to remove all members of           a list in one fell swoop.          o List admin passwords must be non-empty.          o Mailman generated passwords are slightly more mnemonic, and           shouldn't have confusing character selections (i.e. `i'           only, but no `1' or `l').          o Crossposting to two gated mailing lists should be fixed.          o Many other bug fixes and minor web UI improvements.  2.0 beta 5 (01-Aug-2000)      - Bug fix release.  This includes a fix for a small security hole       which could be exploited to gain mailman group access by a local       user (not a mail or web user).      - As part of the fix for the "cookie reauthorization" bug, only       session cookies are used now.  This means that administrative       and private archive cookies expire only when the browser session       is quit, however an explicit "Logout" button has been added.  2.0 beta 4 (06-Jul-2000)      - Bug fix release.  2.0 beta 3 (29-Jun-2000)      - Delivery mechanism (qrunner) refined to support immediate       queuing, queuing directly from MTA, and queuing on any error       along the delivery pipeline.  This means 1) that huge lists       can't time out the MTA's program delivery channel; 2) it is much       harder to completely lose messages; 3) eventually, qrunner will       be elaborated to meter delivery to the MTA so as not to swamp       it.  The tradeoff is in more disk I/O since every message coming       into the system (and most that are generated by the system) live       on disk for some part of their journey through Mailman.        For now, see the Default.py variables QRUNNER_PROCESS_LIFETIME       and QRUNNER_MAX_MESSAGES for primitive resource management.        The API to the pipeline handler modules has changed.  See       Mailman/Handlers/HandlerAPI.py for details.      - Revamped admindb web page: held messages are split into headers       and bodies so they are easier to vette; admins can now also       preserve a held message (for spam evidence gathering) or forward       the message to a specified email address; disposition of held       messages can be deferred; held messages have a more context       meaningful default rejection message.      - Change to the semantics for `acceptable_aliases' list       configuration variable, based on suggestions by Harald Meland.      - New mm_cfg.py variables NNTP_USERNAME and NNTP_PASSWORD can be       set on a site-wide basis if connection to your nntpd requires       authentication.      - The list attribute `num_spawns' has been removed.  The mm_cfg.py       variables MAX_SPAWNS, and DEFAULT_NUM_SPAWNS removed too.      - LIST_LOCK_LIFETIME cranked to 5 hours and LIST_LOCK_TIMEOUT       shortened to 10 seconds.  QRUNNER_LOCK_LIFETIME cranked up to 10       hours.  This should decrease the changes for bogus and harmful       lock breaking.      - Resent-to: is now one of the headers checked for explicit       destinations.      - Tons more bounce formats are recognized.  The API to the bounce       modules has changed.      - A rewritten LockFile module which should fix most (hopefully all)       bugs in the locking machinery.  Many improvements suggested by       Thomas Wouters and Harald Meland.      - Experimental support (disabled by default) for delivering SMTP       chunks to the MTA via multiple threads.  Your Python executable       must have been compiled with thread support enabled, and you       must set MAX_DELIVERY_THREADS in mm_cfg.py.  Note that this may       not improve your overall system performance.      - Some changes and additions to scripts: bin/find_member now       supports a -w/--owner flag to match regexps against mailing list       owners; bin/find_member now supports multiple regexps;       cron/gate_news command line option changes; new script       bin/dumbdb for debugging purposes; bin/clone_member can now also       remove the old address and change change the list owner       addresses.      - The News/Mail gateway admin page has a button that lets you do       an explicit catchup of the newsgroup.      - The CVS repository has been moved out to SourceForge.  For more       information, see the project summary at        http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=103      - Lots 'o bug fixes and some performance improvements.  2.0 beta 2 (07-Apr-2000)      - Rewritten gate_news cron script which should be more efficient       and avoid race and locking problems.  Each list now maintains       its own watermark, and when you use the admin CGI script to turn       on gating from Usenet->mail, an automatic mass catch up is done       to avoid flooding the mailing list.  cron/gate_news's command       line interface has also changed.  See its docstring for       details.      - A new cron script called qrunner has been added to retry message       deliveries that fail because of temporary smtpd problems.      - New command line script called bin/list_lists which does exactly       that: lists all the mailing lists on the system (much like the       listinfo CGI does).      - bin/withlist is now directly executable, however if you want to       use python -i, you must still explicitly invoke it.       bin/withlist also now cleans up after itself by unlocking any       locked lists.  It does NOT save any dirty lists though - you       must do this explicitly.      - $prefix permissions (and all subdirs) must now be 02775.       bin/check_perms has been updated to fix all the subdir       permissions.      - "make update" (a.k.a. bin/update) is run automatically when you       do a "make install"      - The CGI driver script now puts information about the Python       environment into the logs/error file (but not the diagnostic web       page).      - Bug fixes and some performance improvements  2.0 beta 1 (19-Mar-2000)      - Python 1.5.2 (or newer) is now required.      - A new bundled auto-responder has been added.  You can now       configure an autoresponse text for each list's primary       addresses:          listname@yourhost.com -- the general posting address         listname-request@...  -- the automated "request bot" address         listname-admin@...    -- the human administrator address      - The standard UI now includes three logos at the bottom of the       page: Dragon's Mailman logo, the Python Powered logo, and the       GNU logo.  All point to their respective home pages.      - It is now possible to set the Reply-To: field on lists to an       arbitrary address.  NOTE: Reply-To: munging is generally       considered harmful!  However for some read-only lists, it is       useful to direct replies to a parallel discussion list.      - There is a new message delivery architecture which uses a       pipeline processor for incoming and internally generated       messages.  Mailman no longer contains a bundled bulk-mailer;       instead message delivery is handled completely by the MTA.  Most       MTAs give a high enough priority to connections from the       localhost that mail will not be lost because of system load, but       this is not guaranteed (or handled) by Mailman currently.  Be       careful also if your smtpd is on a different host than the       Mailman host.  In practice, mail lossage has not be observed.        For this reason cron/run_queue is no longer needed (see the       UPGRADING file for details).        Also, you can choose whether you want direct smtp delivery, or       delivery via the command line to a sendmail-compatible daemon.       You can also easily add your own delivery module.  See       Mailman/Defaults.py for details.      - A similar pipeline architecture for the parsing of bounce       messages has been added.  Most common bounce formats are now       handled, including Qmail, Postfix, and DSN.  It is now much       easier to add new bounce detectors.      - The approval pending architecture has also been revamped.       Subscription requests and message posts waiting for admin       approval are no longer kept in the config.db file, but in a       separate requests.db file instead.      - Finally made consistent the use of Sender:/From:/From_ in the       matching of headers for such things as member-post-only.  Now,       if USE_ENVELOPE_SENDER is true, Sender: will always be chosen       over From:, however the default has been changed to       USE_ENVELOPE_SENDER false so that From: is always chosen over       Sender:.  In both cases, if no header is found, From_ (i.e. the       envelope sender is used).  Note that the variable is now       misnamed!  Most people want From: matching anyway and any are       easily spoofable.      - New scripts bin/move_list, bin/config_list      - cron/upvolumes_yearly, cron/upvolumes_monthly, cron/archive,       cron/run_queue all removed.  Edit your crontab if you used these       scripts.  Other scripts removed: contact_transport, deliver,       dumb_deliver.      - Several web UI improvements, especially in the admin page.      - Remove X-pmrqc: headers to prevent return reciepts for Pegasus       mail users.      - Security patch when using external archivers.      - Honor "X-Archive: No" header by not putting this message in the       archive.      - Changes to the log file format.      - The usual bug fixes.  1.1 (05-Nov-1999)      - All GIFs removed.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html       for the reason why.      - Improvements to the Pipermail archiver which make things faster.       Primary change is that the .txt files are not gzipped on every       posted message.  Instead, use the new cron script `nightly_gzip'       to gzip the .txt file in batches (this means that the .txt file       will lag behind the on-line archives a little).      - From the C drivers programs, Python is invoked with the -S       option.  This tells Python to avoid importing the site module,       which can improve start up time of the Python process       considerably.  Note that the command line script invocation has       not been changed.      - New configuration variables PUBLIC_EXTERNAL_ARCHIVER and       PRIVATE_EXTERNAL_ARCHIVER which can contain a shell command       string for os.popen().  This can be used to invoke an external       archiver instead of the bundled Pipermail archiver.  See       Defaults.py for details.      - new script `bin/find_member' which can be used to search for a       member by regular expression.      - More child processes are reaped, which should eliminate most       occurrences of zombie processes.      - A few small miscellaneous bug fixes (including PR#99, PR#107)       and improvements to the file locking algorithms.  1.0 (30-Jul-1999)      - Configure script now allows $PREFIX (by default /home/mailman)       to be permissions 02755.  Also, configure now tests for       vsnprintf()      - Workaround, taken from GNU screen, for systems missing       vsnprintf()      - Return-Receipt-To: and Disposition-Notification-To: headers are       always removed from posted messages (they can be used to troll       for list membership).      - Workaround for MSIE4.01 (and possibly other versions) bug in the       handling of cookies.      - A small collection of other bug fixes.  1.0rc3 (10-Jul-1999)      - new script bin/check_perms which checks (and optionally fixes)       the permissions and group ownerships of the files in your       Mailman installation.      - Removed a bottleneck in the archiving code that was causing       performance problems on highly loaded servers.      - The code that saves a list's state and configuration database       has been made more robust.      - Additional exception handlers have been added in several places       to alleviate problems with Mailman bombing out when it really       would be better to print/log a helpful message.      - The "password" mail command will now mail back the sender's       subscription password when given with no arguments.      - The embarrassing subject-prefixing bug present in rc2 has been       fixed.      - A small (but nice :) collection of other squashed bugs.  1.0rc2 (14-Jun-1999)      - A security flaw in the CGI cookie mechanisms was discovered --       the Mailman-issued cookies were easily spoofable, implying that       e.g. admin access to all Mailman lists via the web interface       could be compromised.  This flaw has now been fixed.      - Handling of SMTP errors has been improved.      - Both "Mass Subscription" via web admin interface and       bin/add_members have been greatly sped up.      - autoconf check for syslog has been revamped, and is now verified       to work on SCO OpenServer 5.  If syslog can't be found, the C       wrappers will compile, but without any syslog calls.      - Various other bug fixes.  1.0rc1 (04-May-1999)      - There is a new Mailman logo, contributed by The Dragon De       Monsyne.  Please read the INSTALL file for information about       installing the logo in a place your Web server can find it.      - USE_ENVELOPE_SENDER is now set to 0 by default.  Turning this on       caused problems for too many users; lists restricted to       member-only posts were not matching the addresses correctly.      - A revamped bin/withlist to be a little more useful.      - A revamped cron/mailpasswds which groups users by virtual hosts.      - The usual assortment of bug fixes.  1.0b11 (03-Apr-1999)      - Bug fixes and improvements for case preservation of subscribed       addresses.  The DATA_FILE_VERSION has been bumped to 14.      - New script bin/withlist, useful for interactive debugging.  1.0b10 (26-Mar-1999)      - New script bin/sync_members which can be used to synchronize a       list's membership against a flat (e.g. sendmail :include: style)       file.      - bin/add_members and bin/remove_members now accept addresses on       the command line with `-' as the value for the -d and -n       options.      - Added variable USE_ENVELOPE_SENDER to Defaults.py for site-wide       configuration of address matching scheme.  With this variable       set to true, the envelope sender (e.g. Unix "From_" header) is       used to match addresses, otherwise the From: header is used.       Envelope sender matching seems not to work on many systems.       This variable is currently defaulted to 1, but may change to 0       for the final release.      - Reorganization of the membership management admin page.  Also       member addresses are linked to their options page.  Only the       `General' category has the admin password change form.      - Major reorganization of email command handling and responses.       `notmetoo' is the preferred email command instead of `norcv',       although the latter is still accepted as an argument.  If more       than 5 errors are found in the message, command processing is       halted.      - User options page now shows the user their case-preserved       subscribed address as well.      - The usual assortment of bug fixes.  1.0b9 (01-Mar-1999)      - New bin scripts: clone_member, list_members, add_members (a       consolidation of convertlist and populate_new_list which have       been removed).      - Two new readmes have been added: README.LINUX and README.QMAIL      - New configure option --with-cgi-ext which can be used if your       Web server requires extensions on CGI scripts.  The extension       must include a dot (e.g. --with-cgi-ext=".cgi").      - Many bug fixes, including the setgid problem that was causing       mail to be lost on some versions of Linux.  1.0b8 (14-Jan-1999)       - Bug fixes and workarounds for certain Linuxes.       - Illegal addresses are no longer allowed to be subscribed, from        any interface.  1.0b7 (31-Dec-1998)       - Many, many bug fixes.  Some performance improvements for large        lists.  Some improvements in the Web interfaces.  Some security        improvements.  Improved compatibility with Python 1.5.       - bin/convert_list and bin/populate_new_list have been replaced        by bin/add_members.       - Admins can now get notification on subscriptions and        unsubscriptions.  Posts are now logged.       - The username portion of email addresses are now case-preserved        for delivery purposes.  All other address comparisions are        case-insensitive.       - New default SMTP_MAX_RCPTS that limits the number of "RCPT TO"        SMTP commands that can be given for a single message.  Most        MTAs have some hard limit.       - "Precedence: bulk" header and "List-id:" header are now added        to all outgoing messages.  The latter is not added if the        message already has a "List-id:" header.  See RFC 2046 and        draft-chandhok-listid-02 for details.       - The standard (as of Python 1.5.2) smtplib.py is now used.       - The install process now compiles all the .py files in the        installation.       - Versions of the Mailman papers given at IPC7 and LISA-98 are        now included.  1.0b6 (07-Nov-1998)       - Archiving is (finally) back in.       - Administrivia filter added.       - Mail queue mechanism revamped with better concurrency control.       - For recipients that have estmp MTAs, set delivery notification        status so that only delivery failure notices are sent out,        inhibiting 4 hour and N day warning notices.       - Now expire old unconfirmed subscription requests, rather than        keeping them forever.       - Added proposed standard List-Id: header, and our own        X-MailmanVersion header.       - Prevent havoc from attempts to subscribe a list to itself.  (!)       - Refine mail command processing to prevent loops.       - Pending subscription DB redone with better locking and cleaner        interface.       - posters functionality expanded.       - Subscription policy more flexible, sensible, and        site-configurable.       - Various and sundry bug fixes.  1.0b5 (27-Jul-1998)      - New file locking that should be portable and work w/ NFS.      - Better use of packages.      - Better error logging and reporting.      - Less startup overhead.      - Various and sundry bug fixes.   1.0b4 (03-Jun-1998)      - A configure script for easy installation (Barry Warsaw)      - The ability to install Mailman to locations other than       /home/mailman (Barry Warsaw)      - Use cookies on the admin pages (also hides admin pages from       others) (Scott Cotton)      - Subscription requests send a request for confirmation, which may       be done by simply replying to the message (Scott Cotton)      - Facilities for gating mail to a newsgroup, and for gating a       newsgroup to a mailing list (John Viega)      - Contact the SMTP port instead of calling sendmail (primarily for       portability) (John Viega)      - Changed all links on web pages to relative links where appropriate.       (John Viega)      - Use MD5 if crypt is not available (John Viega)      - Lots of fixing up of bounce handling (Ken Manheimer)      - General UI polishing (Ken Manheimer)      - mm_html: Make it prominent when the user's delivery is disabled       on his option page. (Ken Manheimer)      - mallist:DeleteMember() Delete the option setings if any. (Ken       Manheimer)  1.0b3 (03-May-1998)      - mm_message:Deliverer.DeliverToList() added missing newline       between the headers and message body.  Without it, any sequence       of initial body lines that _looked_ like headers ("Sir: Please       excuse my impertinence, but") got treated like headers.      - Fixed typo which broke subscription acknowledgement message       (thanks to janne sinkonen for pointing this out promptly after       release).  (Anyone who applied my intermediate patch will       probably see this one trigger patch'es reversed-patch       detector...)      - Fixed cgi-wrapper.c so it doesn't segfault when invoked with       improper uid or gid, and generally wrappers are cleaned up a       bit.      - Prevented delivery-failure notices for misdirected subscribe-       confirmation requests from bouncing back to the -request addr,       and then being treated as failing requests.        Implemented two measures.  Set the reply-to for the       confirmation- request to the -request addr, and the sender to be       the list admin.  This way, bounces go to list admin instead of       to -request addr.  (Using the errors-to header wasn't       sufficient.  Thanks, barry, for pointing out the use of sender       here.)  Second, ignore any mailcommands coming from postmaster       or non-login system type accounts (mailer-daemon, daemon,       postoffice, etc.)      - Reenabled admin setting of web_page_url - crucial for having       lists use alternate names of a host that occupies multiple       addresses.      - Fixed and refined admin-options help mechanism.  Top-level visit       to general-category (where the "general" isn't in the URL) was       broken.  New help presentation shows the same row that shows on       the actual options page.      - cron/crontab.in crontab template had wrong name for senddigests.      - Default digest format setting, as distributed, is now non-MIME,       on urging of reasoned voices asserting that there are still       enough bad MIME implementations in the world to be a nuisance to       too many users if MIME is the default.  Sigh.      - MIME digests now preserve the structure of MIME postings,       keeping attachments as attachments, etc.  They also are more       structured in general.      - Added README instructions explaining how to determine the right       UID and GID settings for the wrapper executables, and improved       some of the explanations about exploratory interaction       w/mailman.      - Removed the constraint that subscribers have their domain       included in a static list in the code.  We might want to       eventually reincorporate the check for the sake of a warning       message, to give a heads up to the subscriber, but try delivery       anyway...      - Added missing titles to error docs.      - Improved several help details, including particularly explaining       better how real_name setting is used.      - Strengthened admonition against setting reply_goes_to_list.      - Added X-BeenThere header to postings for the sake of prevention       of external mail loops.      - Improved handling of bounced messages to better recognize       members address, and prevent duplicate attempts to react (which       could cause superfluous notices to administrator).      - Added __delitem__ method to mm_message.OutgoingMessage, to fix       the intermediate patch posted just before this one.      - Using keyword substitution format for more message text (ie,       "substituting %(such)s into text" % {'such': "something"}) to       make the substitutions less fragile and, presumably, easier to       debug.      - Removed hardwired (and failure-prone) /tmp file logging from       answer.majordomo_mail, and generally spiffed up following janne       sinkkonen's lead.  1.0b2 (13-Apr-1998) 1.0b1 (09-Apr-1998)    Web pages much more polished    - Better organized, text more finely crafted    - Easier, more refined layout    - List info and admin interface overviews, enumerate all public lists      (via, e.g., http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo - sans the      specific list)    - Admin interface broken into sections, with help elaboration for      complicated configuration options    Mailing List Archives    - Integrated with a newer, *much* improved, external pipermail - to be      found at http://starship.skyport.net/crew/amk/maintained/pipermail.html    - Private archives protected with mailing list members passwords,      cookie-fied.    Spam prevention    - New spam prevention measures catch most if not all spam without      operator intervention or general constraints on who can post to      list:        require_explicit_destination option imposes hold of any postings        that do not have the list name in any of the to or cc header        destination addresses.  This catches the vast majority of random        spam.      Other options (forbidden_posters, bounce_matching_headers) provide      for filtering of known transgressors.    - Option obscure_addresses (default on) causes mailing list subscriber      lists on the web to be slightly mangled so they're not directly      recognizable as email address by web spiders, which might be      seeking targets for spammers.    Site configuration arrangement organized - in mailman/mailman/modules:    - When installing, create a mailman/modules/mm_cfg.py (if there's not      one already there), using mm_cfg.py.dist as a template.      mm_default.py contains the distributed defaults, including      descriptions of the values.  mm_cfg.py does a 'from mm_defaults.py      import *' to get the distributed defaults.  Include settings in      mm_cfg.py for any values in mm_defaults.py that need to be      customized for your site, after the 'from .. import *'.    See mm_cfg.py.dist for more details.    Logging    - Major operations (subscription, admin approval, bounce,      digestification, cgi script failure tracebacks) logged in files      using a reliable mechanism    - Wrapper executables log authentication complaints via syslog    Wrappers    - All cgi-script wrapper executables combined in a single source,      easier to configure.  (Mail and aliases wrappers separate.)    List structure version migration    - Provision for automatic update of list structures when moving to a      new version of the system.  See modules/versions.py.    Code cleaning    - Many more module docstrings, __version__ settings, more function      docstrings.    - Most unqualified exception catches have been replaced with more      finely targeted catches, to avoid concealing bugs.    - Lotsa long lines wrapped (pet peeve:).    Random details (not complete, sorry):    - make archival frequency a list option    - Option for daily digest dispatch, in addition to size threshhold    - make sure users only get one periodic password notifcation message for      all the lists they're on (repaired 1.0b1.1 varying-case mistake)    - Fix rmlist sans-argument bug causing deletion of all lists!    - doubled generated random passwords to four letters    - Cleaned lots and lots of notices    - Lots and lots of html page cleanup, including table-of-contents, etc    - Admin options sections - don't do the "if so" if the ensuing list      is empty    - Prevent list subject-prefix cascade    - Sources under CVS    - Various spam filters - implicit-destination, header-field    - Adjusted permissions for group access    - Prevent redundant subscription from redundant vetted requests    - Instituted centralize, robustish logging    - Wrapper sources use syslog for logging (john viega)    - Sorting of users done on presentation, not in list.    - Edit options - give an error for non-existent users, not an options page.    - Bounce handling - offer 'disable' option, instead of remove, and      never remove without notifying admin    - Moved subscribers off of listinfo (and made private lists visible      modulo authentication)    - Parameterize default digest headers and footers and create some    - Put titles on cgi result pages that do not get titles (all?)    - Option for immediate admin notifcation via email of pending      requests, as well as periodic    - Admin options web-page help    - Enabled grouped and cascading lists despite implicit-name constraint    - Changed subscribers list so it has its own script (roster)    - Welcome pages: http://www.python.org/mailman/{admin,listinfo}/  0.95 (25-Jan-1997)   - Fixed a bug in sending out digests added when adding disable mime option.   - Added an option to not notify about bounced posts.   - Added hook for pre-posting filters.  These could be used to     auto-strip signatures.  I'm using the feature to auto-strip footers     that are auto-generated by mail received from another mailing list.  0.94 (22-Jan-1997)   - Made admin password work ubiquitously in place of a user password.   - Added an interface for getting / setting user options.   - Added user option to disable mime digests (digested people only)   - Added user option to not receive your own posts (nondigested people only)   - Added user option to ack posts   - Added user option to disable list delivery to their box.   - Added web interface to user options   - Config number of sendmail spawns on a per-list basis   - Fixed extra space at beginning of each message in digests...   - Handled comma separated emails in bounce messages...   - Added a FindUser() function to MailList.  Used it where appropriate.   - Added mail interface to setting list options.   - Added name links to the templates options page   - Added an option so people can hide their names from the subscription list.   - Added an answer_majordomo_mail script for people switching...  0.93 (18/20-Jan-1997)   -  When delivering to list, don't call sendmail directly.  Write to a file,      and then run the new deliver script, which forks and exits in the parent      immediately to avoid hanging when delivering mail for large lists, so that      large lists don't spend a lot of time locked.   -  GetSender() no longer assumes that you don't have an owner-xxx address.   -  Fixed unsubscribing via mail.   -  Made subscribe via mail generate a password if you don't supply one.   -  Added an option to clobber the date in the archives to the date the list      resent the post, so that the archive doesn't get mail from people sending       bad dates clumped up at the beginning or end.   -  Added automatic error message processing as an option.  Currently      logging to /tmp/bounce.log   -  Changed archive to take a list as an argument, (the old way was broken)   -  Remove (ignore) spaces in email addresses   -  Allow user passwords to be case insensitive.   -  Removed the cleanup script since it was now redundant.   -  Fixed archives if there were no archives.   -  Added a Lock() call to Load() and Create().  This fixes the      problem of loading then locking.   -  Removed all occurances of Lock() except for the ones in mailing      list since creating a list      now implicitly locks it.   -  Quote single periods in message text.   - Made bounce system handle digest users fairly.  0.92 (13/16-Jan-1997)   -  Added Lock and Unlock methods to list to ensure each operation is atomic   -  Added a cmd that rms all files of a mailing list (but not the aliases)   -  Fixed subscribing an unknown user@localhost (confirm this)   -  Changed the sender to list-admin@... to ensure we avoid mail loops.   -  check to make sure there are msgs to archive before calling pipermail.   -  started using this w/ real mailing lists.   -  Added a cron script that scours the maillog for User/Host unknown errs   -  Sort membership lists   -  Always display digest_is_default option   -  Don't slam the TO list unless you're sending a digest.   -  When making digest summaries, if missing sender name, use their email.   -  Hacked in some protection against crappy dates in pipermail.py   -  Made it so archive/digest volumes can go up monthly for large large lists.   -  Number digest messages   -  Add headers/footers to each message in digest for braindead mailers   -  I removed some forgotten debug statements that caused server errors          when a CGI script sent mail.   -  Removed loose_matches flag, since everything used it.   -  Fixed a problem in pipermail if there was no From line.   -  In upvolume_ scripts, remove INDEX files as we leave a volume.   -  Threw a couple of scripts in bin for generating archives from majordomo's      digest-archives.  I wouldn't recommend them for the layman, though, they      were meant to do a job quickly, not to be usable.  0.91 (23-Dec-1996)   -  broke code into mixins for managability   -  tag parsing instead of lots of gsubs   -  tweaked pipermail (see comments on pipermail header)   -  templates are now on a per-list basis as intended.   -  request over web that your password be emailed to you.   -  option so that web subscriptions require email confirmation.   -  wrote a first pass at an admin interface to configurable variables.   -  made digests mime-compliant.   -  added a FakeFile class that simulates enough of a file object on a         string of text to fool rfc822.Message in non-seek mode.   -  changed OutgoingMessage not to require its args in constructor.   -  added an admin request DB interface.   -  clearly separated the internal name from the real name.   -  replaced lots of ugly, redundant code w/ nice code.         (added Get...Email() interfaces, GetScriptURL, etc...)   -  Wrote a lot of pretty html formatting functions / classes.   -  Fleshed out the newlist command a lot.  It now mails the new list         admin, and auto-updates the aliases file.   -  Made multiple owners acceptable.   -  Non-advertised lists, closed lists, max header length, max msg length   -  Allowed editing templates from list admin pages.   -  You can get to your info page from the web even if the list is closed.   Local Variables: mode: indented-text indent-tabs-mode: nil End:  ``` |

Package        : mailman
Version        : 1:2.1.18-2+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12137

A vulnerability was discovered in mailman. GNU Mailman 2.x before 2.1.30
uses the .obj extension for scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME
parts. This behavior may contribute to XSS attacks against
list-archive visitors, because an HTTP reply from an archive web
server may lack a MIME type, and a web browser may perform MIME
sniffing, conclude that the MIME type should have been text/html, and
execute JavaScript code.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1:2.1.18-2+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1830007#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-04-30 17:26:16 UTC  ``` GNU Mailman 2.x before 2.1.30 uses the .obj extension for scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME parts. This behavior may contribute to XSS attacks against list-archive visitors, because an HTTP reply from an archive web server may lack a MIME type, and a web browser may perform MIME sniffing, conclude that the MIME type should have been text/html, and execute JavaScript code.

openSUSE Security Update: Recommended update for mailman
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2020:1752-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1171363 #1173369
Cross-References: CVE-2020-12108 CVE-2020-12137 CVE-2020-15011
Affected Products:
openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for mailman to version 2.1.34 fixes the following issues:
- The fix for lp#1859104 can result in ValueError being thrown
on attempts to subscribe to a list. This is fixed and extended to apply
REFUSE\_SECOND\_PENDING to unsubscription as well. (lp#1878458)
- DMARC mitigation no longer misses if the domain name returned by DNS
contains upper case. (lp#1881035)
- A new WARN\_MEMBER\_OF\_SUBSCRIBE setting can be set to No to prevent
mailbombing of a member of a list with private rosters by repeated
subscribe attempts. (lp#1883017)
- Very long filenames for scrubbed attachments are now truncated.
(lp#1884456)
- A content injection vulnerability via the private login page has been
fixed. CVE-2020-15011 (lp#1877379, bsc#1173369)
- A content injection vulnerability via the options login page has been
discovered and reported by Vishal Singh. CVE-2020-12108 (lp#1873722,
bsc#1171363)
- Bounce recognition for a non-compliant Yahoo format is added.
- Archiving workaround for non-ascii in string.lowercase in some Python
packages is added.
- Thanks to Jim Popovitch, there is now a dmarc\_moderation\_addresses list
setting that can be used to apply dmarc\_moderation\_action to mail From:
addresses listed
or matching listed regexps. This can be used to modify mail to
addresses that don't accept external mail From: themselves.
- There is a new MAX\_LISTNAME\_LENGTH setting. The fix for lp#1780874
obtains a list of the names of all the all the lists in the
installation in order to determine the maximum length of a legitimate
list name. It does this on every web access and on sites with a very
large number of lists, this can have performance implications. See the
description in Defaults.py for more information.
- Thanks to Ralf Jung there is now the ability to add text based captchas
(aka textchas) to the listinfo subscribe form. See the documentation
for the new CAPTCHA setting in Defaults.py for how to enable this. Also
note that if you have custom listinfo.html templates, you will have to
add a <mm-captcha-ui> tag to those templates to make this work. This
feature can be used in combination with or instead of the Google
reCAPTCHA feature added in 2.1.26.
- Thanks to Ralf Hildebrandt the web admin Membership Management section
now has a feature to sync the list's membership with a list of email
addresses as with the bin/sync\_members command.
- There is a new drop\_cc list attribute set from DEFAULT\_DROP\_CC. This
controls the dropping of addresses from the Cc: header in delivered
messages by the duplicate avoidance process. (lp#1845751)
- There is a new REFUSE\_SECOND\_PENDING mm\_cfg.py setting that will cause
a second request to subscribe to a list when there is already a pending
confirmation for that user. This can be set to Yes to prevent
mailbombing of a third party by repeatedly posting the subscribe form.
(lp#1859104)
- Fixed the confirm CGI to catch a rare TypeError on simultaneous
confirmations of the same token. (lp#1785854)
- Scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME parts will now be given a .bin
extension instead of .obj. CVE-2020-12137 (lp#1886117)
- Added bounce recognition for a non-compliant opensmtpd DSN with Action:
error. (lp#1805137)
- Corrected and augmented some security log messages. (lp#1810098)
- Implemented use of QRUNNER\_SLEEP\_TIME for bin/qrunner
--runner=All. (lp#1818205)
- Leading/trailing spaces in provided email addresses for login to
private archives and the user options page are now ignored. (lp#1818872)
- Fixed the spelling of the --no-restart option for mailmanctl.
- Fixed an issue where certain combinations of charset and invalid
characters in a list's description could produce a List-ID header
without angle brackets. (lp#1831321)
- With the Postfix MTA and virtual domains, mappings for the site list
-bounces and -request addresses in each virtual domain are now added to
data/virtual-mailman (-owner was done in 2.1.24). (lp#1831777)
- The paths.py module now extends sys.path with the result of
site.getsitepackages() if available. (lp#1838866)
- A bug causing a UnicodeDecodeError in preparing to send the
confirmation request message to a new subscriber has been fixed.
(lp#1851442)
- The SimpleMatch heuristic bounce recognizer has been improved to not
return most invalid email addresses. (lp#1859011)

Just for some added info, Mailman v2.1.30 is almost released, the holdup
is with some language translations.  Mailman v2.1.30 will be the last of
the Mailman v2 releases as primary development and effort has long
shifted to Mailman v3. Further, the Mailman v2 branch is tied to Python
v2, which is now EOL by the fine Python folk.

Once Mailman v2.1.30 is release, I'm sure the various distributions will
pull the commit and merge the particulars into their release branches,
and that will surely include this XSS fix.

I'm not a formal Mailman Developer, but as a contributor and member of
the general Mailman Community I say Thank You to Hanno for identifying
and reporting  this vulnerability.

-Jim P.

each mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc. over the Web. Even the list manager can administer
his or her list entirely from the Web. Mailman also integrates most
things people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail
<-> news gateways, and so on.

Documentation can be found in: /usr/share/doc/mailman

When the package has finished installing, you will need to perform some
additional installation steps, these are described in:
/usr/share/doc/mailman/INSTALL.REDHAT

Subject: mailman 2.x: XSS via file attachments in list archives

I have reported this quite a while ago and forgotten to properly
announce it.

In the mailman 2 mailing list manager there's a stored cross site
scripting vulnerability due to the way file attachments are handled.

Up to mailman 2.1.29 when sending a file without a file extension (or
an unknown file extension) then the file is stored in the list archive
with the file extension .obj.
Most web servers (e.g. apache httpd) will try to assign a mime type
based on the file extension and entries in /etc/mime.types.

In many Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu) .obj is not
specified in /etc/mime.types. This means the web server will usually
send it out without a mime type.
The browser will then try to guess the MIME type based on the file's
content (MIME-sniffing). If the content is HTML then it will execute any
javascript contained.

I have reported this a while ago to mailman and they changed the
default from .obj to .bin. All distributions I tested assign
application/octet-stream to .bin files, which makes sure the browser
does not try to sniff the file type.
This change is in mailman 2.1.30rc1, but not in any stable release of
mailman.

I gave a talk discussing this type of vulnerability at last year's
SecurityFest conference:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t8JYpt0egE>

Mitigating factors:
* Some web servers send a default mime type (e.g. nginx). This is
  generally a good way to prevent such vulnerabilities, although some
  people disagree [1]
* In Gentoo and Suse it is assigned to application/x-tgif, which is
  probably not what's intended here, but enough to prevent the
  vulnerability.
* Setting "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" will not prevent this
  vulnerability type in all browsers. The reason is that originally
  this header only applied to javascript and css content, not to HTML.
  Chrome still disables content sniffing for HTML, Firefox hopefully
  will soon.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2020:1707-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1171363 #1173369
Cross-References: CVE-2020-12108 CVE-2020-12137 CVE-2020-15011
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 15.2

An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for mailman to version 2.1.34 fixes the following issues:
- The fix for lp#1859104 can result in ValueError being thrown
on attempts to subscribe to a list. This is fixed and extended to apply
REFUSE\_SECOND\_PENDING to unsubscription as well. (lp#1878458)
- DMARC mitigation no longer misses if the domain name returned by DNS
contains upper case. (lp#1881035)
- A new WARN\_MEMBER\_OF\_SUBSCRIBE setting can be set to No to prevent
mailbombing of a member of a list with private rosters by repeated
subscribe attempts. (lp#1883017)
- Very long filenames for scrubbed attachments are now truncated.
(lp#1884456)
- A content injection vulnerability via the private login page has been
fixed. CVE-2020-15011 (lp#1877379, bsc#1173369)
- A content injection vulnerability via the options login page has been
discovered and reported by Vishal Singh. CVE-2020-12108 (lp#1873722,
bsc#1171363)
- Bounce recognition for a non-compliant Yahoo format is added.
- Archiving workaround for non-ascii in string.lowercase in some Python
packages is added.
- Thanks to Jim Popovitch, there is now a dmarc\_moderation\_addresses list
setting that can be used to apply dmarc\_moderation\_action to mail From:
addresses listed
or matching listed regexps. This can be used to modify mail to
addresses that don't accept external mail From: themselves.
- There is a new MAX\_LISTNAME\_LENGTH setting. The fix for lp#1780874
obtains a list of the names of all the all the lists in the
installation in order to determine the maximum length of a legitimate
list name. It does this on every web access and on sites with a very
large number of lists, this can have performance implications. See the
description in Defaults.py for more information.
- Thanks to Ralf Jung there is now the ability to add text based captchas
(aka textchas) to the listinfo subscribe form. See the documentation
for the new CAPTCHA setting in Defaults.py for how to enable this. Also
note that if you have custom listinfo.html templates, you will have to
add a <mm-captcha-ui> tag to those templates to make this work. This
feature can be used in combination with or instead of the Google
reCAPTCHA feature added in 2.1.26.
- Thanks to Ralf Hildebrandt the web admin Membership Management section
now has a feature to sync the list's membership with a list of email
addresses as with the bin/sync\_members command.
- There is a new drop\_cc list attribute set from DEFAULT\_DROP\_CC. This
controls the dropping of addresses from the Cc: header in delivered
messages by the duplicate avoidance process. (lp#1845751)
- There is a new REFUSE\_SECOND\_PENDING mm\_cfg.py setting that will cause
a second request to subscribe to a list when there is already a pending
confirmation for that user. This can be set to Yes to prevent
mailbombing of a third party by repeatedly posting the subscribe form.
(lp#1859104)
- Fixed the confirm CGI to catch a rare TypeError on simultaneous
confirmations of the same token. (lp#1785854)
- Scrubbed application/octet-stream MIME parts will now be given a .bin
extension instead of .obj. CVE-2020-12137 (lp#1886117)
- Added bounce recognition for a non-compliant opensmtpd DSN with Action:
error. (lp#1805137)
- Corrected and augmented some security log messages. (lp#1810098)
- Implemented use of QRUNNER\_SLEEP\_TIME for bin/qrunner
--runner=All. (lp#1818205)
- Leading/trailing spaces in provided email addresses for login to
private archives and the user options page are now ignored. (lp#1818872)
- Fixed the spelling of the --no-restart option for mailmanctl.
- Fixed an issue where certain combinations of charset and invalid
characters in a list's description could produce a List-ID header
without angle brackets. (lp#1831321)
- With the Postfix MTA and virtual domains, mappings for the site list
-bounces and -request addresses in each virtual domain are now added to
data/virtual-mailman (-owner was done in 2.1.24). (lp#1831777)
- The paths.py module now extends sys.path with the result of
site.getsitepackages() if available. (lp#1838866)
- A bug causing a UnicodeDecodeError in preparing to send the
confirmation request message to a new subscriber has been fixed.
(lp#1851442)
- The SimpleMatch heuristic bounce recognizer has been improved to not
return most invalid email addresses. (lp#1859011)

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-69f2f1d987
2020-05-14 02:28:00.022575
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mailman
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 2.1.30
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.list.org/>
Summary : Mailing list manager with built in Web access
Description :
Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives
each mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc. over the Web. Even the list manager can administer
his or her list entirely from the Web. Mailman also integrates most
things people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail
<-> news gateways, and so on.

Documentation can be found in: /usr/share/doc/mailman

When the package has finished installing, you will need to perform some
additional installation steps, these are described in:
/usr/share/doc/mailman/INSTALL.REDHAT
