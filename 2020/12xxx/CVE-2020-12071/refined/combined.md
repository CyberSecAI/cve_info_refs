## Description

![@SecGus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61525295?u=80446ba638843c9c9dc635278e61919f129b3af1&v=4&size=48)[SecGus](https://github.com/SecGus)opened [on Apr 22, 2020](https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms/issues/1333#issue-604994344)
### Summary

A user is able to inject JavaScript into a post via the post creation feature.

### Expected Behaviour

The CMS should HTML encode any inputted data so it is reflected back safely to the user.

### Actual Behaviour

The CMS reflects back the post content without HTML encoding, meaning the client browser renders it as valid HTML / JS on the main page, and on that posts page. This can lead to malicious javascript being executed on anyone who visits the site's browser.

### Context details (if applicable)

* Anchor version: 0.12.7
* Server setup: Ubuntu running apache2 and PHP 7.2
* Reproduction:

1. Login to admin panel.
2. Create a blog post where the post title can be anything, and post content is an XSS payload, in my case, I used `<script>alert(1);</script>`.
3. Go to the main page to trigger the payload, alternatively, go to the blog post created in the previous step, this too shall trigger the payload.

As we can see in the blog post source, the title and category are both HTML encoded before being reflected back to the user, although, the post content is not, and our browser renders our JS as valid code.
