Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a ciphertext side channel attack that can be exploited during ECDSA operations on AMD processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Ciphertext Side Channel:** The primary weakness lies in the susceptibility of certain cryptographic operations to side-channel attacks. Specifically, the ciphertext generated during ECDSA operations can leak information about the private key when observed over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:**  A successful attack can lead to the disclosure of private key information. This would compromise the confidentiality of the cryptographic system.
*   **Guest Data Leakage:** A malicious hypervisor could potentially leak guest data by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attacker:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local authenticated attacker.
*   **Malicious Hypervisor:** An attacker with control over a hypervisor could monitor ciphertext values generated within a virtualized environment to infer data values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to monitor memory use on the target system.
*   In a virtualized environment, the attacker would need to be a malicious hypervisor with the capability to observe ciphertext values within a guest.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability specifically impacts AMD EPYC processors, including embedded versions.
*   The issue is present in Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Encrypted State (SEV-ES) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), The Ohio State University, and the University of Lubeck.
*   AMD has released mitigations for 3rd Gen EPYC processors using the VMSA Register Protection feature in conjunction with SEV-SNP.
*   Previous generations of EPYC processors are vulnerable, and AMD recommends following security best practices to mitigate attacks from a malicious hypervisor.
