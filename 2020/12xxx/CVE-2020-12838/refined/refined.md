    "details": "The provided content is from the vendor's website and focuses on marketing the security and privacy aspects of the iSmartgate product, it is not related to the specific vulnerability of privilege escalation through /cron/checkExpirationDate.php, however, it provides some useful context on the vendor's security claims.\n\nThe text explicitly claims that:\n\n*   \"nobody but you can access to the list of users, admin settings, log of events or daily history.\"\n*   \"all information is stored locally\" and \"No data is stored in the cloud.\"\n*   \"We can not access any information from the use or set up of the system. Therefore, we can not monitor you.\"\n*   \"ismartgate works\* even if internet is down.\"\n*    \"Your data is not shared with anybody. In other words, it's only accessible by you.\"\n\nThe document also contrasts its local storage approach to the typical cloud-based platform. \n\nThese claims are in direct contradiction to the actual vulnerabilities found in the associated CVE, particularly the privilege escalation that allows a remote attacker to gain full control over the device.\n\nSince this document doesn't contain technical details about the vulnerability, I will rate the technical information as NOINFO, even though the document provides some context."
