Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12111:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `httpSetEncryptKeyRpm` method of the `ipcamera` binary on TP-Link cloud cameras.
*   The `EncryptKey` parameter, received from a POST request to `/setEncryptKey.fcgi`, is directly incorporated into a command line executed as root without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection due to the lack of sanitization of the user-supplied `EncryptKey` parameter before its inclusion in a system command.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) as root:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network access to the device's web interface.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** Exploitation requires sending a crafted POST request to `/setEncryptKey.fcgi` with malicious commands injected into the `EncryptKey` parameter.
*   **Authentication Required**: An attacker would need to be authenticated to the web interface to send the malicious request

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device's web interface.
*   **Web interface access:** The attacker must authenticate to the web interface of the TP-Link camera to send the malicious request

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected devices are TP-Link NC260 and NC450 cloud cameras, specifically firmware versions NC260 <= 1.5.2 build 200304 and NC450 <= 1.5.3 build 200304.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in firmware versions NC260 <= 1.5.3 build_200401 and NC450 <= 1.5.4 build 200401
*   The vulnerability was reported to TP-Link on March 29, 2020, and patched firmware was provided for verification on April 27, 2020
*   Public disclosure occurred on April 29, 2020.
*   Disassembly code snippets shows how the `EncryptKey` parameter is directly used in the `cmCommand` execution without any sanitization.
