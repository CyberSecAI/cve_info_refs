Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12277:

**CVE-2020-12277**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw where repository mirroring was not disabled even when the feature was not explicitly activated.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper access control or feature deactivation logic. The system failed to properly enforce the intended mirroring state based on the feature's activation status.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A project repository could be mirrored without the feature being enabled as intended, potentially leading to unauthorized access of the repository data. This could lead to information disclosure and potentially a compromise of the project.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would likely need to have sufficient privileges to manipulate repository mirroring settings.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:  A malicious user could potentially gain access to the mirrored repository without explicit authorization. This would require the attacker to be a member of the project with sufficient privileges to exploit the repository mirroring functionality.

**Affected Versions:**

*   GitLab EE/CE 10.8 and later.
