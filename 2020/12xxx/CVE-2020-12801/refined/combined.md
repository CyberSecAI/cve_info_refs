LibreOffice extension called [localwriter](https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter). Here’s what he had to say…**

**Dione Maddern** and The Documentation Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of the **LibreOffice Calc Guide 24.8**, an update of the existing Calc Guide 24.2 with enhancements taken from the current LibreOffice 24.8 Calc module.

[![Calc Guide 24.8](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CoverCalc248-724x1024.png)](http://books.libreoffice.org)

The book was reviewed for clarity, readability and content additions, notably the **Calc database table referencing in formulas**, removal of deprecated JavaScript debugger and refactoring of the Calc’s chart topic – in which the chapter on charts was split in two, one for the chart basics and the second for the chart types.…

**Marcial Machado recently [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libreoffice/comments/1hf4sqo/i_made_an_impress_template_in_native_opt_to_play/) about his “fully-featured LibreOffice Impress template for creating Jeopardy-style games. Just add your questions and categories, and you’re good to go!” So let’s find out more…**

### What does the template do?

At its core, the template is meant to emulate what a game of Jeopardy is like. You can click on any of the squares on the game board and it will send you to the slide with the associated question, where you can either return to the board in the case of a misclick, or reveal the answer to the question.…

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1171997#c0)  Robert Frohl   2020-05-22 12:26:04 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-12801  If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and crashes, that document is auto-saved encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If the recovery is successful, and if the file format of the recovered document was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected versions of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving a MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing it to be encrypted. This issue affects: LibreOffice 6-3 series versions prior to 6.3.6; 6-4 series versions prior to 6.4.3.

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinnÃ¼tzige rechtsfÃ¤hige Stiftung des bÃ¼rgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world’s leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

Package        : libreoffice
Version        : 1:6.1.5-3+deb10u11
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12801 CVE-2020-12802 CVE-2020-12803 CVE-2023-6185
                 CVE-2023-6186

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LibreOffice an
office productivity software suite:

CVE-2020-12801

    If LibreOffice has an encrypted document
    open and crashes, that document is auto-saved encrypted.
    On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document
    and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If the recovery
    is successful, and if the file format of the recovered document
    was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected versions
    of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document
    are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving
    a MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing
    it to be encrypted.

CVE-2020-12802

    LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only
    documents from locations deemed 'trusted' are allowed to
    retrieve remote resources. This mode is not the default mode,
    but can be enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability
    to include remote resources within a document. A flaw existed
    where remote graphic links loaded from docx documents were omitted
    from this protection.

CVE-2020-12803

    ODF documents can contain forms to be
    filled out by the user. Similar to HTML forms, the contained
    form data can be submitted to a URI, for example, to an external
    web server. To create submittable forms, ODF implements the
    XForms W3C standard, which allows data to be submitted without
    the need for macros or other active scripting. LibreOffice allowed
    forms to be submitted to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling
    form submissions to overwrite local files. User-interaction
    is required to submit the form, but to avoid the possibility
    of malicious documents engineered to maximize the possibility of
    inadvertent user submission this feature has now been limited to
    http[s] URIs, removing the possibility to overwrite local files.

CVE-2023-6185

    An Improper Input Validation vulnerability
    was found in GStreamer integration of The Document
    Foundation LibreOffice allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
    GStreamer plugins. In affected versions the filename of the
    embedded video is not sufficiently escaped when passed to
    GStreamer enabling an attacker to run arbitrary
    gstreamer plugins depending on what plugins are installed
    on the target system.

CVE-2023-6186

    LibreOffice supports hyperlinks.
    In addition to the typical common protocols such as
    http/https hyperlinks can also have target URLs that
    can launch built-in macros or dispatch built-in
    internal commands. In affected version of LibreOffice
    there are scenarios where these can be executed without warning
    if the user activates such hyperlinks. In later versions
    the users's explicit macro execution permissions
    for the document are now consulted if these non-typical
    hyperlinks can be executed. The possibility to use these
    variants of hyperlink targets for floating frames has been removed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:6.1.5-3+deb10u11.

We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinnÃ¼tzige rechtsfÃ¤hige Stiftung des bÃ¼rgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world’s leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

### CVE-2020-12801

**Title:** CVE-2020-12801 Crash-recovered MSOffice encrypted documents defaulted to not to using encryption on next save

**Announced:** May 28, 2020

**Fixed in:** 6.3.6/6.4.3

**Description**:

If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and crashes, that document is auto-saved encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If the recovery is successful, and if the file format of the recovered document was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected versions of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document are unencrypted.

This may lead to a user accidentally saving a MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing it to be encrypted.

In the fixed versions, encrypted recovered MSOffice format documents default to encrypted save.

**Credits**:

Thanks to Tomas Florian <tomas@armoreye.ca> for raising awareness of the issue

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
