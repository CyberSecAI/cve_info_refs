Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-12801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an issue in how LibreOffice handles encrypted documents after a crash and recovery. Specifically, if an encrypted document is open, and LibreOffice crashes, the auto-saved recovery file is created as encrypted. Upon restart, if the recovered file is not in LibreOffice's default ODF format (e.g. it's a Microsoft Office format like .docx), then subsequent saves of that document will be unencrypted by default, even though the user may believe the document remains encrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect encryption handling:** LibreOffice fails to retain the encryption settings for non-ODF documents after a crash and recovery.
*   **Lack of user notification:** The user is not notified that the document is no longer being saved with encryption, thus leading to accidental data exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information in the document can be exposed if saved without encryption.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Users may inadvertently save encrypted documents unencrypted, leading to a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Accidental Data Exposure:** The vulnerability relies on a user opening an encrypted non-ODF document, experiencing a crash, and then unknowingly saving the recovered document unencrypted. This is a case of a program not behaving as expected and thus, a user error, however, it can be exploited by social engineering a user into opening a specially crafted document to trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Limited attacker capabilities:** No direct attacker involvement is required as the vulnerability is triggered by normal user actions after the initial crash of the program.
*   **User interaction**: User needs to open an encrypted document of a format other than ODF. Then LibreOffice has to crash and the user has to recover the document and save it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects LibreOffice versions prior to 6.3.6 and 6.4.3.
*   The fix ensures that encrypted recovered MSOffice format documents default to encrypted saves.
