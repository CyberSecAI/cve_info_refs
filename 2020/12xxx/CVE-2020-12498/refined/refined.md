Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data when parsing MWE files by Phoenix Contact's PC WORX and PC WORX Express executables. This lack of validation can lead to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the vulnerability is described as an out-of-bounds read, due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing MWE files. This vulnerability is classified as a stack-based buffer overflow by CERT@VDE but the official NVD and ZDI descriptions say out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, leading to remote code execution.
- The impact is rated as high for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires user interaction. The user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to manipulate a PC Worx project file and then have a user open the manipulated project.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious MWE file to the target, likely through a manipulated project file or some other means to induce user interaction.
- No special privileges are required on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Phoenix Contact Automationworx PC WORX and PC WORX Express versions 1.87 and earlier.
- Phoenix Contact has released an update to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by "mdm" working with the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The provided information includes details from both the Zero Day Initiative and CERT@VDE, which provide a consistent description of the vulnerability.
- CERT@VDE lists a similar CVE (CVE-2020-12497), which is a stack-based buffer overflow in PLCopen XML file parsing within the same product versions.
