{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect parsing and interpretation of SPF/DKIM authentication results within the opendmarc DMARC email filter system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parsing of authentication results.",
      "Inconsistent interpretation of SPF/DKIM results.",
        "Inconsistent behavior across different components of the email processing system.",
        "Failure to properly handle malformed inputs."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can inject authentication results to provide false information about the domain that originated an email message. This can lead to successful email spoofing and potentially phishing attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting emails with malformed or ambiguous SPF/DKIM records.",
            "Manipulating the MAIL FROM address to cause inconsistencies between SPF and DMARC checks.",
          "Injecting meta-characters in domain names to cause inconsistent parsing by different components (DNS,DKIM).",
         "Crafting malformed addresses in MAIL FROM to bypass SPF and DMARC veriÔ¨Åcation",
     "Exploiting differences between the mail server's authentication checks and how the MUA displays the email (UI mismatch).",
        "Replaying DKIM signed messages with manipulated headers and/or body."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send emails through SMTP.",
          "Ability to craft email headers and content.",
        "Understanding of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols."
    ],
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from inconsistencies in how different components of the email authentication process (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) interpret and handle authentication results. These inconsistencies can be exploited to bypass sender authentication checks and spoof emails. The paper 'Composition Kills: A Case Study of Email Sender Authentication' provides an in-depth analysis of such composition vulnerabilities in email systems and lists several different attack vectors that exploit these inconsistencies in email authentication systems.",
