Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-12672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `ReadMNGImage` function within the `coders/png.c` file of GraphicsMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when data is written past the allocated memory boundary on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) due to the program crashing.
- There is a potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MNG image file. This means an attacker needs to provide a malicious MNG file to an application using GraphicsMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious MNG file to a vulnerable application using GraphicsMagick for processing.
- The attacker would likely be in a position to provide the file through some input mechanism (e.g., website, file upload, email).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects GraphicsMagick versions up to and including 1.3.35
- The issue is present when magnifying MNG images, suggesting that resizing operations might be the trigger.
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity by openSUSE and "normal" severity by Gentoo, but SUSE rates it as "important"
- The CVSS v3 score of 7.5 indicates a high potential for impact with a base score of 7.5, emphasizing the ease of exploitation and high availability impact.
- Patches have been released by various distributions, including openSUSE, Debian, and Gentoo, to address this issue.
