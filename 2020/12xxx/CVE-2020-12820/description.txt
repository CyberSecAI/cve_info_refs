Under non-default configuration, a stack-based buffer overflow in FortiOS version 6.0.10 and below, version 5.6.12 and below may allow a remote attacker authenticated to the SSL VPN to crash the FortiClient NAC daemon (fcnacd) and potentially execute arbitrary code via requesting a large FortiClient file name. We are not aware of proof of concept code successfully achieving the latter.
