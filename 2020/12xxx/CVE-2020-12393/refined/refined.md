Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12393:

**Root Cause:**

The "Copy as cURL (Windows)" feature in Firefox's DevTools network panel did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request. This allowed for the injection of shell commands via a crafted HTTP method that includes the `$( )` sequence, when the copied command is pasted into a Windows PowerShell terminal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By embedding shell commands within the HTTP method string (which isn't URL encoded in the cURL command generation), an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on a user's machine through the "Copy as cURL (Windows)" function.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code generating the cURL command for Windows lacked proper input sanitization, specifically the dollar sign ($) character, which is used to denote subexpressions in PowerShell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Installing malware.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   System compromise.
    *   Opening arbitrary applications such as `calc.exe` as demonstrated in the provided exploit PoC

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Request Manipulation:** An attacker would need to generate a network request with a crafted HTTP method that includes `$( )` or equivalent command injection sequences. This can be achieved by serving a malicious web page.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction by using the "Copy as cURL (Windows)" feature on the crafted request from the network tab in devtools, and pasting the generated command into a PowerShell terminal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker would need to host a web page or control a website that can make a specific network request with malicious content in the HTTP method, as the exploit cannot be triggered without a malicious network request.
*   **Limited User Interaction:** The user has to manually copy the cURL command using the "Copy as cURL (Windows)" function and then paste and execute the command in a PowerShell terminal.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is specific to Windows because of PowerShell's command parsing behavior.
* The fix for the vulnerability involves properly escaping the dollar sign ($) in the cURL command generated for Windows.
* This was classified as a "sec-moderate" security issue.
