- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management due to user sessions not being closed correctly. When a user with fewer rights logs in, they are assigned higher rights from a previous session.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web-based user interface has a role-based access system with dynamic tokens. However, user sessions are not terminated properly. This leads to a situation where a new user can inherit the privileges of a prior user with higher access rights.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user with lower privileges can gain higher privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web-based user interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a legitimate user of the system, able to log in through the web interface. They do not necessarily require specific network access if they are already on the network and have access to the web interface.
