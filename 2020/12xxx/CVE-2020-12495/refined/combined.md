The affected device has a web-based user interface with a role-based access system. Users with different roles have different write and read privileges.

[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12495)

---

#### Impact

The vulnerability is that user sessions are not closed correctly and a user with fewer rights is assigned the higher rights when he logs on.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

Customers should configure a perimeter firewall to block traffic from untrusted networks and users to the device. These recommendations will be incorporated into the device documentation (operating instructions).

Change default password for operator, service and admin account.

Endress+Hauser will not change this behavior.
Customers are recommended to take the measures for Temporary Fix / Mitigation as described above.
