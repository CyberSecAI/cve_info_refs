The Minister for Health has determined the end of the COVIDSafe data period effective from 16 August 2022. All COVIDSafe app data has now been deleted from the National COVIDSafe Data Store.

The COVIDSafe app has been decommissioned and is no longer available to download. The existing COVIDSafe apps are no longer functional. You should delete the COVIDSafe app from your device.

The Coronavirus Australia app and the Australian Government WhatsApp Channel for COVID-19 have also been decommissioned and no longer function.

The COVIDSafe website remained available until the end of November 2022 when the decommissioning process was completed.
