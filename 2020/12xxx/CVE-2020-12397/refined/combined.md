+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1506587](/show_bug.cgi?id=1506587 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sender Email Address Spoofing by extraneous white space in display name") +++

By abusing Unicode whitespaces (e.g., U+3000) within the 'From:' email header, an attacker can spoof the sender email address when displayed by the Thunderbird mail client.

Turns out [bug 1506587](/show_bug.cgi?id=1506587 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sender Email Address Spoofing by extraneous white space in display name") didn't fix the case where the special characters are encoded.

Testcase in [attachment 9128245](/attachment.cgi?id=9128245 "testcase.eml") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9128245&action=edit "testcase.eml").

Yes, I was wondering which code path RFC 2047 encoded tokens would take.

Please expand on this comment as follows:
1) State the characters encoded in the base64 string. I tried decoding it at <https://www.base64decode.org/>, but from the result I can't see which invisible characters you used.
2) Please state that \u00A0 is a NBSP and \u2003 is an EM space
3) \u2003 is used in the code, but \u200B is used in the comment. Most likely you have the latter in the base64 string, but that's hard to tell.

Actually,

YmzDtiA8aW52aXNpYmxlc3BhY2VAZnJpZW5kLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tPiAu decodes to `blö <invisiblespace@friend.example.com> .` and encoding that again I get

YmzDtiA8aW52aXNpYmxlc3BhY2VAZnJpZW5kLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tPiAu

So it seems to me that the comment is in fact incorrect and the RFC 2047 token doesn't contain invisible (zero width) spaces like \u200B. It's also not used outside the token so it appears that the test doesn't actually prove anything :-(

jfkthame, is there a CSS property that can collapse sequences of space-like and default-ignorable characters to a single rendered space without modifying the DOM text node value?

I can't think of something in CSS that would do this... we have the [CSS white space processing](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-processing) rules, but collapsing only applies to normal <space> (and <tab>) characters, not to what the spec calls "other space separators".

As a minor optimization to the patch, I think that `cleanToken()` shouldn't be invoked at all if the token only contains characters in the ASCII range `\x20-\x7E`. So only call `cleanToken(t.token)` if the following regex test `/[^\x20-\x7E]/.test(t.token)` returns true. There is no point cleaning the token if it doesn't contain any zero-width characters, especially that consecutive spaces are collapsed outside of the `cleanToken` function.

Adds some tests but other than that it's mostly moving the call to a better place.

There is one slight imperfection in the patch. For case D I replace with space, not remove. For some reason if i replace with "" throughout the process, somewhere, e.g. for zero width space the spaces surrounding it will also get completely removed. I haven't figured out exactly why, but it shouldn't matter in practice.

Up to you, but I'd assign to a new variable like "tokenCleaned" rather than re-assign here. Especially in a long function like this it's harder to keep track of what's what, like whether "token" is cleaned yet or not.

This needs a comment. I'm not a great fan of this hacky UTF16 to UTF8 conversion, see [bug 1551746](/show_bug.cgi?id=1551746 "NEW - Replace use of escape() and unescape() in hacky UTF-8 <--> UTF-16 conversion").

The comment is incorrect :-( - Just proving the confusion.

```
+        // btoa takes a binary string to encode. unescape(encodeURIComponent(source))
+        // does UTF-8 to binary conversion. See bug 1551746 for other ways.

```

Correct is this:

unescape(encodeURIComponent(source)) encodes the JavaScript UTF-16 representation of the string into UTF-8.

And please lose the comment about btoa. It just takes some bytes, and bytes are always binary, in fact, everything is binary ;-)

Well, yes, btoa() takes some arbitrary binary data. I don't think the hint is useful since we all know that. But more importantly, the comment is totally wrong, since the aim is not UTF-8 to binary, whatever that might mean, but UTF-16 to UTF-8.

# USN-4373-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

26 May 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6831](/security/CVE-2020-6831), [CVE-2020-12387](/security/CVE-2020-12387), [CVE-2020-12395](/security/CVE-2020-12395))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

properly escape the HTTP POST data of a request. If a user were tricked

in to using the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with

specially crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2020-12392](/security/CVE-2020-12392))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not correctly handle Unicode

whitespace characters within the From email header. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to spoof the sender email address that

Thunderbird displays. ([CVE-2020-12397](/security/CVE-2020-12397))

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 68.8.0

Announced
May 5, 2020
Impact
critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 68.8

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-12397: Sender Email Address Spoofing using encoded Unicode characters](#CVE-2020-12397)

Reporter
Ahmed Elsobky (@0xSobky)
Impact
low
##### Description

By encoding Unicode whitespace characters within the From
email header, an attacker can spoof the sender email address
that Thunderbird displays.

##### References

* [Bug 1617370](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1617370)

#### [#CVE-2020-12387: Use-after-free during worker shutdown](#CVE-2020-12387)

Reporter
Looben Yang
Impact
critical
##### Description

A race condition when running shutdown code for Web Worker led to a use-after-free vulnerability. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1545345](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1545345)

#### [#CVE-2020-6831: Buffer overflow in SCTP chunk input validation](#CVE-2020-6831)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

A buffer overflow could occur when parsing and validating SCTP chunks in WebRTC. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-12392: Arbitrary local file access with 'Copy as cURL'](#CVE-2020-12392)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP POST data of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as cURL' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in the disclosure of local files.

#### [#CVE-2020-12393: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-12393)

Reporter
David Yesland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as cURL' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

#### [#CVE-2020-12395: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.8.0](#CVE-2020-12395)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alexandru Michis, Jason Kratzer, philipp, Ted Campbell, Bas Schouten, André Bargull, and Karl Tomlinson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
