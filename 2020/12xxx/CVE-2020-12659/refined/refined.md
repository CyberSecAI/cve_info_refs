Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2020-12659**
*   **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in `xdp_umem_reg` function within `net/xdp/xdp_umem.c` due to lack of proper headroom validation when registering a umem ring for XDP sockets.
*   **Weakness/vulnerability:**
    *   Improper validation of user-provided headroom values during umem registration. Specifically, the check allows a user to register a headroom value that is larger than the available space in the chunk after the fixed XDP headroom has been considered, which leads to `chunk_size_nohr` calculation error where `umem->chunk_size_nohr` becomes larger than actual size.
    *   The `size_chk` variable was being checked against 0 and negative values are treated as successful.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability can set the headroom to a value larger than the chunk size minus the XDP headroom.
    *   This allows packets with a length exceeding the supported size in the umem to be accepted.
    *   Results in an out-of-bounds write, leading to a denial of service (system crash), or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   A local attacker with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Attacker needs local access and ability to use `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities.

**Additional notes from the content:**

*   The SUSE security advisory mentions that CVE-2020-12659 has been rated as "moderate" severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 5.1
*   The commit message for the fix highlights how to trigger the vulnerability, which allows for a larger than chunk size xdp_buff, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   The commit message also mentions that while the vulnerability exists, the access to the vulnerable function requires specific capabilities, so impact may be low.
*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to 5.6.7.
*   The fix involves changing the size check to `headroom >= chunk_size - XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM` instead of `size_chk < 0`, preventing users from specifying an oversized headroom.
*   The patch introduces a stricter headroom validation check.

**CVE-2020-12656**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of certain `domain_release` calls in `gss_mech_free` function in `net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c`, specifically within the RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5 implementation.
*   **Weakness/vulnerability:** Memory leak due to missing `domain_release` calls.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Resource exhaustion via memory leak.
*   **Attack vectors:** Trigger module unload, which is considered as privileged operation.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Privilege to unload specific kernel module.

**Additional notes from the content:**

*   The SUSE security advisory mentions that CVE-2020-12656 has been rated as "low" severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 2.9
*   The CVE description is disputed due to its low impact. Loading kernel modules is a privileged operation, and attackers can trigger memory leaks via custom modules anyway.
