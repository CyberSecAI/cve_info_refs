The provided content relates to CVE-2020-12699.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "Direct Mail" extension for TYPO3 CMS does not properly sanitize or validate the `jumpUrl` parameter, which is used for redirecting users after they click a link in a newsletter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect: The lack of proper validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs into the `jumpUrl` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft malicious links within newsletters. When users click these links, they are redirected to an attacker-controlled website instead of the intended destination, which can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious URLs with an attacker-controlled target in the `jumpUrl` parameter. These URLs are then sent within newsletters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send newsletters using the vulnerable extension. This implies the attacker needs access to the backend of the TYPO3 instance, likely as an authenticated user with rights to send newsletters, or the ability to influence the content of emails sent using the extension.
