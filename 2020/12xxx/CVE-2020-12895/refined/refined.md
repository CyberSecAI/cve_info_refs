Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Pool/Heap Overflow in the AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10. It occurs within the driver's handling of Escape call 0x110037.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Pool/Heap Overflow: A buffer overflow condition in memory allocation. This means that more data is being written to a memory buffer than its allocated size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of Privilege: The attacker could gain higher privileges on the system.
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive information stored in memory could be leaked.
- Denial of Service: The system could crash or become unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an Escape call (0x110037) within the AMD Graphics Driver for Windows 10, which is an IOCTL interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the AMD Graphics Driver.
- Low privilege access is sufficient to trigger this vulnerability
