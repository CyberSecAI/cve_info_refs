After analyzing the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-12715:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content, particularly the `README.md` file from the GitHub repository `bzyo/cve-pocs`, directly references CVE-2020-12715 and describes a vulnerability in PacsOne Server 6.8.4. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is **Incorrect Access Control** in PacsOne Server 6.8.4. Specifically, the DICOM image upload feature does not restrict file types.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability of authenticated users to upload arbitrary file types (including malicious code like PHP scripts) via the DICOM image upload functionality.
*   **Predictable File Naming:** The server uses a predictable naming convention for uploaded files, which makes it easier for an attacker to locate and access the files. The naming scheme is `date-time-username-filename.extension`

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading and executing malicious code (e.g., a PHP reverse shell), an attacker can gain access to the system. The level of privilege will depend on how the webserver is configured.
*   **System Compromise:** If the web server is running with high privileges, the attacker may be able to fully compromise the server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An authenticated user can upload a malicious file using DICOM image upload.
*   **Direct Access:** Either authenticated or unauthenticated users can directly access uploaded files via the predictable URL structure.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication (Required for Upload):** To upload the malicious code, an attacker must have valid credentials for the PacsOne Server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the server hosting PacsOne Server to upload files, and then access uploaded files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided README.md includes a timeline showing the vulnerability was submitted and resolved by 2020-05-21, and a new version was released 2020-09-10.
*   The vulnerability was submitted for public disclosure on 2020-09-19.
*  The README.md explicitly states that the content is for educational purposes only, and the author is not responsible for misuse.

Therefore, the content provides a good analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-12715.
