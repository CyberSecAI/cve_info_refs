Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's automatic username normalization process, specifically within the `User::newFromName` method and the `splitTitleString` method used internally, where certain characters are trimmed, mapped, or stripped when creating user names. This allowed an attacker to create a user account with a modified name (e.g., by adding spaces or underscores) that would be normalized to an existing userâ€™s name, thus allowing account takeover.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Normalization:** The core issue is that MediaWiki's username normalization was too aggressive, allowing variations of a username to be treated as the same, leading to a bypass of intended user separation.
*   **Character Mapping/Stripping:** Specific characters like spaces, underscores, and bidirectional override characters were being removed or converted during the normalization process, which allowed for the creation of seemingly distinct usernames that would resolve to the same normalized name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Impersonation/Takeover:** An attacker could create a new account with a username that, after normalization, matched an existing user's name, thereby gaining access to that user's account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the targeted account was an administrator, the attacker would gain full administrative privileges, leading to the ability to delete arbitrary pages, vandalize the site, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Potential for Widespread Impact:**  The vulnerability affected not just the CASAuth extension where it was discovered, but potentially other SSO login extensions due to the underlying MediaWiki username normalization issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SSO Login Process:** The attack vector involves exploiting the username normalization during the login process with an SSO (Single Sign-On) provider.
*   **Account Creation:** The attacker must create a new user account with a manipulated name in the external SSO provider.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to SSO Provider:** The attacker needs the ability to create user accounts on the SSO provider used by the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of Usernames:**  The attacker needs to know the username of the account they wish to impersonate.
*   **No Prior Access to the target system:**  The attacker doesn't need to be an existing user on the targeted MediaWiki instance.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered in the CASAuth extension but has implications for other SSO extensions that rely on MediaWiki's username handling.
*   The fix involved adding stricter checks to prevent usernames with specific combinations of spaces, underscores, and bidirectional characters from being created. The checks were implemented both within the CASAuth extension and by addressing the underlying issue with MediaWiki's normalization process, specifically with changes in `MediaWikiTitleCodec.php`.
*   The primary mitigation involved regex-based checks within the `casNameLookup` function, which was part of the fix for the CASAuth extension. This was later improved to include Unicode characters and bidirectional override characters found in the `splitTitleString` method within MediaWiki core.
