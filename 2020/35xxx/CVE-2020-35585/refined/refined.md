Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of sufficient anti-enumeration mechanisms for the screen key within the Mersive Solstice Pod. The system does not implement adequate protection against brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to guess the screen key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Anti-Automation:** The Solstice Pod does not employ any anti-automation techniques. This allows attackers to easily automate the process of trying different screen keys via the Solstice Open Control API.
*   **Predictable Response:** The server returns a consistent response ("`{ "screenKeyValidationRequired": "true" }`") for incorrect screen keys, allowing an attacker to determine if the attempt was incorrect and to continue trying new keys.
*   **Small Keyspace:** Although the screen key is 4 alpha-numerical characters, resulting in 1,679,616 possible combinations, the lack of anti-automation and consistent response makes this keyspace vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to obtain the screen key. This key could then be used to gain unauthorized access to the Solstice Pod's screen sharing capabilities, potentially exposing sensitive information being presented on the screen.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to screen sharing could disrupt meetings, display malicious content, or be used for other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exposed via the Solstice Open Control API, which is accessible over the network.
*   **Brute-Force Attack:** Attackers can perform a brute-force attack, trying all possible combinations of the screen key, until a valid one is found.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the Solstice Pod.
*   **Automation Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to automate HTTP requests to the Solstice Open Control API.
*   **No prior authentication required:** The screen key enumeration does not require any authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information confirms that the vulnerability is due to insufficient anti-enumeration mechanisms that allow brute force attacks to obtain the screen key.
*   The vulnerability affects all Mersive Solstice Pods running a firmware version prior to 3.3.0 (May 2018) or 4.3 (15966) (November 2019).
*   The provided information includes the exact API request/response that is vulnerable to the attack.
