Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2020-35121**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization when rendering the results of the SQL query, specifically the lack of escaping of HTML special characters.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin allows users to insert arbitrary SQL queries which, when rendered in the browser, could include malicious JavaScript.
*  **Vulnerability:** Javascript injection
*   **Impact:** By inserting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser when they viewed the page. This could lead to a variety of attacks including data theft, session hijacking, or defacing the web page.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could insert a malicious SQL query that included Javascript into the macro's stored data.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have the ability to insert or modify the SQL query used by the plugin. This includes write permissions to a Confluence page containing the macro or the ability to edit the macro directly.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.5.0 of the plugin by escaping HTML special characters when rendering the query results.
*   The document provides a clear and detailed description of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it was fixed, which is much more detailed than a typical CVE description.
