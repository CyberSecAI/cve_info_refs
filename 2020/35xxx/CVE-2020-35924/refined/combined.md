## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 16, 2020](https://github.com/mpdn/try-mutex/issues/2#issue-744093022)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that `TryMutex` implements `Sync` for all types `T`:

[try-mutex/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/mpdn/try-mutex/blob/9775aef4516135958fa428ce08b346325c0493f3/src/lib.rs#L127)

Line 127
in
[9775aef](/mpdn/try-mutex/commit/9775aef4516135958fa428ce08b346325c0493f3)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for TryMutex<T> {} |
| --- | --- |

This should probably be bounded by `T: Send` just like the standard library's [Mutex](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html#impl-Sync), otherwise it allows smuggling non-Send types like `Rc` across thread-boundaries like so:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use try_mutex::TryMutex;

use std::rc::Rc;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

fn main() {
    let rc = Rc::new(());
    let rc_clone = rc.clone();

    let try_mutex = TryMutex::new(rc_clone);
    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|_| {
            let smuggled_rc = try_mutex.try_lock().unwrap();
            println!("RC in thread: {:p}", *smuggled_rc);
        });
    });
    println!("RC in main:   {:p}", rc);
}
```

This outputs:

```
RC in thread: 0x5642ef5ffa50
RC in main:   0x5642ef5ffa50

```

and can lead to data races from safe Rust code.

## Affected versions

0.3.0

## Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync trait for TryMutex type. This allows users to put non-Send T type in TryMutex and send it to another thread, which can cause a data race. The flaw was corrected in the 0.3.0 release by adding T: Send bound for the Sync trait implementation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync trait for `TryMutex<T>` type.

This allows users to put non-Send `T` type in `TryMutex` and send it to another thread, which can cause a data race.

The flaw was corrected in the 0.3.0 release by adding `T: Send` bound for the Sync trait implementation.
