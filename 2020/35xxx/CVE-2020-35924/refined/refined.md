Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `try-mutex` crate incorrectly implemented the `Sync` trait for the `TryMutex<T>` type without requiring `T` to be `Send`. This allowed non-`Send` types to be wrapped in `TryMutex` and shared between threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect `Sync` Implementation:** The `Sync` trait was implemented unconditionally for `TryMutex<T>`, which violated the requirement that types shared between threads must be `Send`.
*   **Data Race:** This flaw could lead to data races when non-`Send` types like `Rc` were shared across threads, resulting in undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Races:** Sharing non-`Send` types between threads via the flawed `TryMutex` implementation resulted in data races.
*   **Undefined Behavior:**  Data races can lead to unpredictable program behavior, such as crashes, incorrect results, or other forms of corruption.
*   **Availability:**  The vulnerability is rated as having a high impact on availability. This is likely due to the potential for program crashes or deadlocks caused by the data races.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker with low privileges. This means an attacker needs to be able to execute code on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability with low privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Threading:** The attacker needs to understand how to create threads and share data between them. They can use `TryMutex` to smuggle non-Send data.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this issue was implemented in version 0.3.0 of the `try-mutex` crate by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Sync` trait implementation for `TryMutex<T>`.
*   The vulnerability was reported on November 17, 2020, and the advisory was issued on December 7, 2020.
*   The severity is considered "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.5.
*  The weakness was classified as CWE-787, which is a write-what-where condition caused by using `unsafe` code.
