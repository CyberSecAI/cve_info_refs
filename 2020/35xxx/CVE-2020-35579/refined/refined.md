The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35579.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the loop request detection mechanism within the subconverter application. The application attempts to prevent loop requests by checking for a specific header (`SubConverter-Request: 1`). However, it uses `evhttp_find_header` which returns only the *first* header with a matching name. By sending a crafted request with a duplicate `SubConverter-Request` header (e.g., `SubConverter-Request: 2`), the attacker can bypass this check because the first header with this name will be the attacker-controlled value and the second one will be what's added by the vulnerable code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate loop request detection. The application relies on checking a single header value, which can be easily manipulated by including multiple headers with the same name.
- The use of `evhttp_find_header` which only returns the first header with a given name, making it susceptible to header injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). By crafting requests that cause an infinite loop, an attacker can overload the server and prevent it from handling legitimate requests. The server becomes unresponsive or very slow, essentially becoming unavailable for normal operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Request Manipulation. The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with a manipulated `SubConverter-Request` header to initiate a loop.
- Utilizing an external URL (e.g., a URL shortener) to redirect back to the server's vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `subconverter` server with specific crafted headers.
- They need to control a URL that can redirect back to the vulnerable server.
