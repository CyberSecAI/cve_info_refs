  "CVE-2020-35473": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is present in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices that utilize an allowlist for connectivity. The allowlist mechanism creates a side channel for tracking, as the device behaves differently based on its allowlist even when using randomized MAC addresses. Moreover, the MAC address randomization scheme is vulnerable to replay attacks.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The allowlist feature in BLE devices introduces a side channel that can be exploited for device tracking. The current MAC address randomization scheme is also vulnerable to replay attacks.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Side channel vulnerability through allowlist behavior",
        "Replay attack vulnerability in MAC address randomization"
      ],
      "impact": "Device tracking. The replay attack allows adversaries to identify whether a targeted device is present based on its allowlist. This vulnerability allows for both passive and active device tracking.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sniffing BLE traffic to observe allowlist-based side channel behavior",
          "Replaying sniffed MAC addresses to probe a device's allowlist"
        ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to passively sniff BLE traffic within range and replay sniffed MAC addresses.",
      "reference": "The content references CVE-2020-35473 as assigned to track this flaw. It also mentions that Google recognized it as a high severity design flaw."
