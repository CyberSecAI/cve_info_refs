Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35532:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `simple_decode_row()` function within the `x3f_utils_patched.cpp` file.

**Weakness:**
The code doesn't properly validate the `row_stride` field of an image, leading to an out-of-bounds read when calculating the memory address to access. Specifically the offset calculation `row * row_stride` is not sufficiently validated against the available `data_size`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash due to an access violation, as the program attempts to read memory outside of the allocated buffer. The provided crash output shows a read from an invalid memory location.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by opening and processing a specially crafted image file (X3F format) that contains a large `row_stride` value. This can be accomplished through an application like ImageMagick which relies on the vulnerable libraw library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious X3F image to a vulnerable application that utilizes the libraw library. This could be done through tricking a user into opening a malicious image or through other means if the application is directly processing user-supplied images.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit diff shows that a check was added to the `simple_decode_row` function to address the vulnerability.
  ```cpp
  if (row*row_stride > ID->data_size - (ID->columns*sizeof(uint32_t)))
    throw LIBRAW_EXCEPTION_IO_CORRUPT;
  ```
- The `debian-lts-announce` email confirms this CVE along with other libraw vulnerabilities fixed in the update.
