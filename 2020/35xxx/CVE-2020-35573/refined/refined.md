Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35573:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from PostSRSd's handling of timestamps in SRS addresses. Specifically, the `srs_timestamp_check` function in `srs2.c` was vulnerable to excessive CPU consumption when processing SRS addresses with excessively long timestamp tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core issue is the lack of proper validation or limitation on the length of timestamp tags in SRS addresses, allowing an attacker to create an address with an extremely long timestamp. This leads to a loop that runs excessively and consumes excessive CPU resources.
- The `srs_timestamp_check` function expects the timestamp tag to have a length of 2 characters. However, if the timestamp is longer, the loop will continue, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful attack results in a denial-of-service condition due to high CPU usage. This could make the affected mail server unresponsive and unable to process legitimate emails.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious SRS address with a very long timestamp tag.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a system running the vulnerable version of PostSRSd. The attacker must construct an email that has an SRS address that triggers the vulnerability.
- No specific privileged access is needed.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix implemented in the commit `4733fb1` addressed the issue by limiting the length of the timestamp. However, the fix was not explicitly shown in the diff provided. The fix was noted in the comment mentioning `strlen(stamp) != 2`
- The vulnerability was reported to MITRE and assigned CVE-2020-35573.
- Several distributions, including Gentoo and Debian, released security updates to address the vulnerability.
