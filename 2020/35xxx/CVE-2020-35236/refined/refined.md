Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with the identified CVE:

**CVE-2020-35236**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of GitLab project delete webhooks. Specifically, the system was not verifying if a project was part of the group that initiated the delete request before processing the deletion.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The system directly used the project name from the webhook to perform the delete action without checking the association between the project and the group.
    *   **Missing Authorization Check:** There was no authorization check to verify if the delete request was coming from the group the project belongs to.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Project Deletion:** An attacker could potentially craft a malicious webhook with a project name they don't have permission to delete. If the system didn't verify the project's group membership, the project could be deleted.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Webhook:** The attacker could send a crafted GitLab project delete webhook to the Lagoon webhook handler. The attacker does not need to be a member of the group containing the project.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Lagoon webhook handler.
    *   **Knowledge of project name:** The attacker would need to know the name of a project to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The commit `1140289bf9fa98b8602ab4662ae867b210d8476b` addresses the issue by introducing a check to verify if the project belongs to the group the delete request is coming from. This is achieved by extracting the `path_with_namespace` from the webhook body to determine the group, and then querying all projects within that group to confirm the existence of the project to be deleted.
*   The fix also includes changes to the `gitlabApi.ts` file, which introduces a `secureGitlabSystemHooks` array to define valid GitLab system hook events. This is used in `extractWebhookData.ts` to verify that the system hook request is actually from GitLab by validating the `x-gitlab-token` header.

In summary, the vulnerability allowed for unauthorized deletion of projects due to missing group membership verification, and this was resolved by adding group membership verification before executing project deletion. Additionally, the gitlab system hooks were verified to originate from Gitlab.
