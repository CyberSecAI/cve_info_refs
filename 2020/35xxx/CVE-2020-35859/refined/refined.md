Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from incorrect logic in the `lucet-runtime-internals` crate related to the allocation of the signal stack (`sigstack`). The signal stack was being allocated one page after the start of the globals section, regardless of the actual size of the globals. This incorrect calculation led to potential overlaps between the globals section and the signal stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The core issue was an off-by-one error in calculating the starting address of the signal stack. The code was not accounting for the size of the Wasm globals when allocating memory for the signal stack. Specifically, the code used `globals + host_page_size()` instead of `globals + region.limits.globals_size + host_page_size()`.
*   **Missing Guard Page:** The guard page for the signal stack was missing due to the incorrect calculation which could lead to further vulnerabilities.
*   **Memory Corruption/Leak:**  Overlapping memory regions due to incorrect allocation could cause guest programs to observe residual signal stack values and potentially leak host data or corrupt guest program memory.
*   **Stack Overflow:** In debug mode, the signal handler's stack could overflow into the globals page due to the incorrect size configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Leak:** An attacker could potentially leak data from the embedding host to guest programs by observing residual values in the overlapping signal stack.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Overlapping memory could lead to corruption of guest program memory.
*  **Unintended code execution:** Stack overflow in signal handler could be exploited for unintended code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:**  The vulnerability could be exploited via a network connection, as indicated by the CVSS vector (AV:N).
*   The vulnerability arises during the allocation of memory for guest programs which can be initiated by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any privileges on the system (PR:N).
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker doesn't need any interaction from a user (UI:N).
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The vulnerability is easy to exploit (AC:L).
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute a guest program with non-default Wasm globals sizes or in a debug mode.

**Additional Details:**
*   The fix involved correcting the sigstack allocation logic to account for the size of Wasm globals.
*   The signal stack size was made configurable, with a larger default size in debug builds.
*   A test was added to verify that a fault in the sigstack guard page is fatal, thus validating the fix.
*   The issue was resolved in versions 0.4.3 and 0.5.1 of the `lucet-runtime-internals` crate.
