### Description

An embedding using affected versions of lucet-runtime configured to use
non-default Wasm globals sizes of more than 4KiB, or compiled in debug mode
without optimizations, could leak data from the signal handler stack to guest
programs. This can potentially cause data from the embedding host to leak to
guest programs or cause corruption of guest program memory.

This flaw was resolved by correcting the sigstack allocation logic.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @acfoltzer **[acfoltzer](/acfoltzer)** commented [Jan 24, 2020](#issue-554907630)

Most of this patch is actually to fix up the tests that were erroneously succeeding because of this bug. The core of the fix is here in `mmap.rs`:

```
-        let sigstack = globals + host_page_size();
+        let sigstack = globals + region.limits.globals_size + host_page_size();

```

This was causing the signal stack to begin one page after the start of the globals section, regardless of how big the globals are. This mostly wasn't causing problems because the default globals size is a page, and we *were* still adding in a page for the guard, meaning the segments didn't actually overlap with default `Limits`. However, the guard page for the signal stack was missing, and configurations with larger globals sizes could end up overlapping the signal stack, potentially allowing guests to observe residual signal stack values.

The lack of a signal stack guard page was *also* making it so that tests running in debug mode would succeed, even though the signal handler was overflowing its stack into the globals page. To make those tests pass with the correct memory layout, the signal stack size is now configurable and set higher by default on debug builds (`cfg(debug_assertions)`). On release mode, the stack use is fine as the problematic series of stack allocations get optimized into some straightforward copies, so we continue to use SIGSTKSZ as a default in that configuration.

Finally, I added a test that tries to write to the sigstack guard page, improved the "is this a fatal fault address?" method, and made sure that all tests run correctly in release mode.

Sorry, something went wrong.
