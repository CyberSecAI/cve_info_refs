Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35918:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `branca` library, before version 0.10.0, would panic instead of returning an error when decoding tokens with invalid Base62 encoding. The code used `.expect()` which caused a panic instead of handling the error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The library's decoding functions (`branca::Branca::decode` and `branca::decode`) did not adhere to their documentation, which stated an error should be returned for invalid Base62 tokens. Instead, they would panic, causing a denial of service.
*   **Panic on Invalid Input:** The use of `.expect()` on the result of the Base62 decoding directly led to a panic, which is an unexpected program termination and a weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a crafted token with invalid Base62 encoding, an attacker could cause the application using the vulnerable `branca` library to panic, leading to a denial of service. This could impact the availability of services relying on the library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Input Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the input data that is passed to the `decode` functions, crafting a token with incorrect Base62 encoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or manipulate the input data that is passed to the decoding functions of the library. This could be through a network request or local data manipulation.
*   **Low Privileges:** According to the CVSS score, low privileges are sufficient to exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported in `return/branca#24`, and the fix was implemented in commit `7da3274`.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-35918 and GHSA-c9rv-3jmq-527w.
*   The fix replaces the `.expect()` call with a `match` statement to return a `BrancaError::InvalidBase62Token` error instead of panicking.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as a denial-of-service vulnerability.
*   The base score is 5.5 with local attack vector, low attack complexity, low privileges, and high impact on availability.
*   The issue is also related to a discussion in `tuupola/branca-spec#22` which highlighted that the base62 encoding specified was actually a base61 encoding.
