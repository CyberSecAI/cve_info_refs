## Description

![@brycx](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34031846?u=e5b300d1cebed485b3dbd38bfcff6187be71c00e&v=4&size=48)[brycx](https://github.com/brycx)opened [on Nov 29, 2020](https://github.com/return/branca/issues/24#issue-752924545)

Documentation for `decode()`, which also implicitly covers `Branca::decode()`, states that:

> If the input is not in Base62 format, it returns a `BrancaError::InvalidBase62Token` Result.

Prior to `v0.10.0` this was not the case, instead a panic would occur:

[branca/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/return/branca/blob/2fd49083450b2d5f20780aa913c14239b5c49dcf/src/lib.rs#L403)

Line 403
in
[2fd4908](/return/branca/commit/2fd49083450b2d5f20780aa913c14239b5c49dcf)

|  | let decoded\_data = b62\_decode(BASE62, &data).expect("Base62 token is invalid."); |
| --- | --- |

This could leave any validating instance vulnerable to potential DoS, when parsing untrusted data and unexpected panics could occur.

This behavior was corrected in [7da3274](https://github.com/return/branca/commit/7da3274bd99b05dce9c3f9b4b129d0145c71820b):

[branca/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/return/branca/blob/289cf60e57d80c9cf43d5a91d8c66422690c517e/src/lib.rs#L427)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

The character set provided in the spec:

```
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy

```

Only contains 61 characters, and is thus a base61 encoding. Looking at the implementations listed on the document, it seems that most of them (if not all) include a `z` to the character set as I would expect.

Is this the intended behaviour? Or should the character set not include the character `z`?

### Description

Prior to `0.10.0` it was possible to have both decoding functions panic unexpectedly,
by supplying tokens with an incorrect base62 encoding.

The documentation stated that an error should have been reported instead.
