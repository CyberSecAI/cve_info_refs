Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35920:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `socket2` crate incorrectly assumed that the memory layout of `std::net::SocketAddrV4` and `std::net::SocketAddrV6` in Rust matches the system's C representation of `sockaddr`. It used direct pointer casting for conversion, which is unsafe due to the lack of guarantees regarding memory layout from the Rust standard library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect memory layout assumption:** The primary vulnerability is the assumption that the Rust `SocketAddr` structures have the same memory layout as their C counterparts.
- **Unsafe pointer casting:** Direct casting of pointers without ensuring layout compatibility can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Lack of compile-time error:** The issue isn't caught by the compiler, leading to potential runtime errors and crashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Invalid memory access:** If the standard library changes the internal layout of `SocketAddr`, the `socket2` crate could read from or write to the wrong memory locations.
- **Availability impact:** The primary impact is a high risk of crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally because it is triggered by incorrect assumptions in how a library interacts with the operating system at the memory level.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable with low privileges, which suggests any local user would be able to trigger it.
- **No user interaction:** Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any specific user action.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was also present in the `net2` crate, which had the same underlying problem (related to CVE-2020-35919).
- The issue is triggered when the standard library changes the implementation of `SocketAddr`'s memory layout, not when a user sends specifically crafted data over a socket. This implies it may be difficult to trigger directly without underlying standard library changes that impact the memory layout.
- The fix is to properly copy the data between structures instead of casting the pointer.
