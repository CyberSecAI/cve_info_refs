Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35483:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from AnyDesk's insecure DLL loading mechanism on Windows. Specifically, it loads the `gcapi.dll` file without proper validation, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The application loads `gcapi.dll` from its application directory, a location where a user might have write permissions.
- **Lack of DLL Signature Validation:** AnyDesk does not verify the digital signature or integrity of the `gcapi.dll` before loading it.
- **Insecure Loading Path:** The application searches for the DLL in an insecure path, rather than only from trusted/system paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious code with the privileges of the user running AnyDesk by placing a malicious `gcapi.dll` file.
- **Complete System Compromise (potentially):** The malicious code can perform a wide variety of malicious actions, potentially leading to full system compromise if the user has high privileges or the malware escalates privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local File System Manipulation:** An attacker with write access to the AnyDesk application directory can place the malicious DLL.
- **Social Engineering (potentially):** Users might be tricked into running a modified portable version of AnyDesk from a compromised directory

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to the AnyDesk application directory. This could be achieved through:
    - Gaining access to the user's account
    - Exploiting another vulnerability
    - Modifying the portable version of the software in a shared location
- **Local Access:** The attack is primarily a local privilege escalation attack.
- **Portable Version:** The portable version is especially vulnerable because it is often run from non-system directories which are more likely to be under the users control, such as the downloads folder.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects AnyDesk for Windows versions 5.4.2 to 6.0.8.
- AnyDesk version 6.1.0 and later versions are protected with additional security checks to prevent the execution of a modified `gcapi.dll`
