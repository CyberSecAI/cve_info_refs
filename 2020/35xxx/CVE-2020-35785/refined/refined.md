The provided content is a security advisory for multiple HTTPd authentication vulnerabilities in Netgear DGN2200v1 routers, but it doesn't specifically mention any CVE ID. It does however provide PSV IDs for the vulnerabilities. This advisory is for a device running firmware versions prior to v1.0.0.60 and identifies the following vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple HTTPd authentication vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The advisory identifies three distinct vulnerabilities via PSV IDs:
*   **PSV-2020-0363:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L (Adjacent network attack, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, scope changed, high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, low availability impact)
*   **PSV-2020-0364:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N (Adjacent network attack, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, scope unchanged, high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, no availability impact)
*   **PSV-2020-0365:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (Adjacent network attack, high attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, scope changed, high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, high availability impact)

**Impact of exploitation:** Depending on the specific vulnerability (PSV ID), the impact could include:
*   Confidentiality breach
*   Integrity breach
*   Partial or complete loss of availability

**Attack vectors:** Attackers need to be on the adjacent network (AV:A) to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attackers need to be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable device (adjacent network).
*   No specific user interaction is needed.
*   No privileges are required.

The advisory urges users to update their firmware to version v1.0.0.60 or later.

It's important to note that this advisory does not directly relate to CVE-2020-35785 as it is a placeholder CVE and does not contain vulnerability information.
