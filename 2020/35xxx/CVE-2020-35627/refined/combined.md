Modul: Custom GiftCard Template

### POC Description

When the "Custom Gift Card Template" function is found in the option to upload image files, when uploading an image, a space must be added in the name of the extension, remaining as follows (variable filename):

`Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="test.php "`

then in the same payload you have to create a php code that does not end with " ?> " you have to comment " /\*\* ", then the request is sent and the file is uploaded with the name that was given previously.

In the directory where your file is uploaded is:

`/wp-content/uploads/cgc_own_img/{filename}.php`

Then if you have imagination you have the RCE

    We use the “Ultimate Gift Card” plugin with the “Customizable Gift Card” addon for WooCommerce in our online store. The plugin works perfectly. The possibilities for our customers are great. They can design their own gift cards and even send them on a specific date. Everything is configurable. And if you have any questions, the support-team is quick, friendly and absolutely competent. The WP Swings-Team does a very good job. We are happy to recommend the plugin to others :-)

    I recently implemented Ultimate Gift Cards for WooCommerce on my store, and I’m incredibly impressed! Here’s why it’s a fantastic choice for anyone looking to add gift cards to their WooCommerce store:

    Top-Notch Support: Let’s start with what truly blew me away. When I encountered a minor setup issue, the Ultimate Gift Cards support team was there in a flash. They were incredibly helpful and promptly resolved my problem, ensuring a smooth launch of my gift card program.

    Modern and User-Friendly Interface: The user interface for both the admin side and the customer experience is top-notch. It’s clean, modern, and intuitive. Adding, managing, and customizing gift cards is a breeze, and customers can easily purchase and redeem them without any hassle.

    Feature-Packed: But the praise doesn’t stop there. Ultimate Gift Cards offers a plethora of features that go beyond the basics. From customizable designs to flexible delivery options, it caters to all your gift card needs.

    Highly Recommend!

    Overall, I can’t recommend Ultimate Gift Cards for WooCommerce highly enough. The exceptional support, user-friendly interface, and feature-rich functionality make it a winner. It’s a fantastic way to boost sales, improve customer engagement, and add a valuable element to your online store.

    The support was responsive and resolved the issue for the plugin GIFT CARD: the tax calculation was not reflected in the display of certain pricing types.

    They will see if they deploy the changes in a future update. In the meantime, I will copy the fixed version of the plugin they made on my clone site to the live site with the procedure they explained to me: “You can simply use WP File Manager to download the zipped file from your clone site and download it and install it on the live site. Or you can do it via. FTP, copy the plugin folder from one site to another.”

    Thank you again.

    I love this gift card plugin because customers can create their own custom Gift Cards and even choose the image cover for it and email it. Then there is a free-of-charge Gift Card Redeem Service. The customer service is also the best I have seen so far. Immediate response and solving every problem, no matter how small it is without extra charge.

     This is currently the best Gift Card plugin for WP. Support is fast, too. Often like “minutes” fast :)

     The best point in the plugin itself is the dynamic PDF generation option. It works well whether sending the PDF as an email attachment or showing it as a download on the Thank You page and/or transactional emails.

     We wanted to optimize our administrative process to link our webshop towards our POS. Together with WPSwings they’ve build for us some specific adaptations towards their module to fit our needs. They were able to deliver on time, within budget and with even no bugs a workable solution. During testing they helped us out to provide feedback for some changed needs. Did quite some investigations on gift cards, but this one was definitely the best on the market.
