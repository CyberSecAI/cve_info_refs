Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35635:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper bounds checking when parsing files containing Nef polygon data within the CGAL library. Specifically, the `SNC_io_parser::read_sface()` function's `store_sm_boundary_item()` method, when handling `SLoop_of` objects, is vulnerable. The code reads indices from the input file and directly uses them to access vectors, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to supply an index value that exceeds the allocated size of internal vectors (like `SLoop_of`). This allows reading memory outside of the intended data structures.
- **Type Confusion:** Due to the out-of-bounds read, an attacker can cause the program to interpret data as the wrong type which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate if the index values read from the input file are within the bounds of the vectors before accessing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most critical impact is the possibility of achieving arbitrary code execution. By carefully crafting the malformed input, an attacker can manipulate the program's memory, control the program flow, and ultimately execute malicious code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input File:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted, malicious input file containing Nef polygon data to a CGAL-based application that parses this file format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide malicious input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input file to a vulnerable application or system that uses CGAL to parse Nef polygon data. This could involve tricking a user into opening a file, or exploiting a service that processes such files.
- **No specific privilege requirements:** The vulnerability can be triggered without special privileges.

**Additional Information**

- The vulnerability exists in the `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h` file, specifically within the `SNC_io_parser::read_sface()` function.
- The vulnerable code uses `store_sm_boundary_item` method to process `SLoop_of` objects.
- The issue stems from not checking array indices before using them to access vector elements.
- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 10.0, indicating its severity.
