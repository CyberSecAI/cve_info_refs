Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35113:

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-35113 is a collective identifier for memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6, and Thunderbird 78.6, reported by Christian Holler. These bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and were considered potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is attributed to "memory safety bugs" which, as a general class, encompasses a range of potential issues such as:

*   Use-after-free: Accessing memory after it has been freed.
*   Heap buffer overflow: Writing beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   Double free: Attempting to free the same memory block twice.
*   Data races: Unsynchronized access to shared memory locations in multi-threaded contexts.

The specific nature of each bug is not detailed in the provided advisory, but the included bugzilla links (1664831 and 1673589)  provide some detail:
*   Bug 1664831 describes a ThreadSanitizer data race in `mozilla::layers::ImageClientSingle::UpdateImage` and `operator=<mozilla::layers::SyncObjectClient>`.
*  Bug 1673589 describes a crash with SIGTRAP in WebAssembly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weaknesses are memory corruption vulnerabilities which can lead to:

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By exploiting memory corruption, attackers can potentially inject and execute their own malicious code.
*   **Denial of Service:** Crashes can be triggered, making the application unavailable.
*   **Information disclosure:** In some cases, memory corruption can allow attackers to read sensitive data from the application's memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Gain control of the affected application.
*   Potentially compromise the user's system.
*   Steal sensitive information.
*   Disrupt the application's availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

The exact attack vectors would depend on the specific memory safety bugs. Given the references to WebAssembly and graphics issues, some potential vectors include:

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers could craft web pages containing malicious WebAssembly code, CSS, or other content designed to trigger the memory corruption vulnerabilities in the browser.
*   **Compromised Content:** Malicious content could be delivered through compromised websites or email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need:

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** A detailed understanding of the specific memory safety bugs.
*   **Technical Skills:** Expertise in crafting exploits that trigger the vulnerabilities reliably.
*   **Ability to deliver malicious content:** The attacker needs to be able to get the user to load the exploit payload by visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious document/email.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that "Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code." This suggests that the bugs were not necessarily immediately exploitable without further analysis and exploit development.
*   The inclusion of these bugs in multiple products (Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird) indicates that the underlying memory safety issues were present in shared code components.

**In summary**, CVE-2020-35113 covers a set of memory safety issues, potentially exploitable to arbitrary code execution, affecting Firefox and Thunderbird. The specific bugs are further detailed in the referenced bugzilla entries, which describe a data race in the graphics layer and a WebAssembly related crash. Successful exploitation requires a solid understanding of the bugs and the ability to deliver malicious content, though further analysis may be required.
