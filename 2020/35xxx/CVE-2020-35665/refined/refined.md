Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35665

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `Event` parameter within the `include/makecvs.php` file. This parameter is directly used in a system command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary system commands without any prior authentication.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The `Event` parameter is not sanitized and is directly used in a system call which allows command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control of the affected system by executing arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `/include/makecvs.php` with a malicious command injected in the `Event` parameter.
*   **Chaining Vulnerabilities:** The exploit leverages command injection to upload a malicious PHP file and then execute arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable TerraMaster TOS device on port 8181
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided content contains a Metasploit module that automates exploitation.
* The vulnerability affects TerraMaster TOS versions 4.2.06 and earlier.
* The vendor released a fix in version 4.2.07.
* The vulnerability is present in the `include/makecvs.php` file and the `Event` parameter.
* The Metasploit module first checks the TOS version and then exploits the command injection vulnerability by uploading a PHP shell, followed by obtaining a reverse shell.
* The exploit uses a combination of command injection to upload a PHP shell and then utilizes Perl to establish a reverse shell.
