Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35896:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ws-rs` crate did not properly check and limit the growth of the outgoing buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient size checks on the outgoing buffer.
- Unbounded memory allocation due to the lack of a cap on the buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can cause the application using the `ws-rs` crate to run out of memory and crash, effectively taking down the service.
- Memory exhaustion: The unbounded growth of the outgoing buffer leads to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending data to the WebSocket server, causing the outgoing buffer to grow uncontrollably.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the WebSocket server.
- No special privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `ws-rs` crate versions <= 0.9.1.
- The issue was corrected in the `parity-ws` fork (>=0.10.0) by disconnecting a client when the buffer runs full.
- The `out_buffer_grow` and `out_buffer_capacity` settings in the `Builder` do not prevent the buffer from growing beyond the specified capacity, as the `check_out_buffer` function does not adhere to these settings.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `check_out_buffer` function in `src/connection.rs`.
