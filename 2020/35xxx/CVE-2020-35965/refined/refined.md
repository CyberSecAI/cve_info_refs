Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-35965:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to errors in calculations related to when `memset` zero operations should be performed in the `exr.c` file of FFmpeg. Specifically, there was an issue with how the `ymin` and `ymax` parameters were handled in the `decode_frame` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The incorrect calculations led to out-of-bounds writes when the memset operation was performed, potentially writing to memory outside of allocated buffer.
- Integer Overflow: There's a mention of "signed integer overflow: 1633771809 * 32960 cannot be represented in type 'int'", which indicates another calculation issue leading to a different flaw.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- Denial of service: Exploitation could also lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed media files/streams: The vulnerabilities are triggered when processing specially crafted media files/streams, specifically those using the EXR format. A remote attacker could entice a user to open a malicious media file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted EXR file that will trigger the incorrect memory calculations in FFmpeg.
- The user must use FFmpeg to process the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was found via continuous fuzzing by the OSS-Fuzz project.
*   The fixes involve adding checks to ensure that memset operations are performed within the bounds of the image and skipping unnecessary loops.
*   The relevant code changes were in `libavcodec/exr.c`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.4 of ffmpeg.
*   Debian LTS advisory DLA-2537-1 addresses this issue, fixing it in version 7:3.2.15-0+deb9u2 for Debian 9 (stretch).
*   Debian Security Advisory DSA-4990-1 also addresses this issue.
*   Gentoo users are advised to upgrade to ffmpeg-4.4 or later.
