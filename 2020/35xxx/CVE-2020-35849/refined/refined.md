Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `bug_revision_view_page.php` script in MantisBT.  Prior to the fix, this page would display information about revisions (including bug IDs and summaries) even if the user was not authorized to view the parent bug or bugnote. This was due to insufficient access controls when directly accessing the `bug_revision_view_page.php` with a crafted `bugnote_id` or `rev_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure.  Unauthorized users could access the `bug_revision_view_page.php` with a valid `bugnote_id` or `rev_id` parameter and view the bug ID and summary information of bug notes they should not have access to. This allowed viewing of private bugnotes id and summary, even if the user did not have permission to see the actual bug note or the bug itself.
*   **Inconsistent Access Control:** The vulnerability was also linked to inconsistent access control between the "View Revisions" link on the bug note page (driven by `private_bugnote_threshold` config) and the direct access to the `bug_revision_view_page.php`. The direct access bypassed the intended access checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Bug Information:**  An attacker could gain unauthorized access to private project's bug IDs and summaries and private bugnotes' IDs, potentially revealing sensitive information about ongoing issues or discussions.
*   **Circumvention of Access Controls:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to circumvent the intended access control mechanisms in MantisBT by directly accessing the revisions page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a URL to `bug_revision_view_page.php` by manipulating the `bugnote_id` or `rev_id` parameter to access revision information of bug notes that they should not have access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MantisBT User Account:** The attacker would require an account on the MantisBT system, even with low-level privileges (e.g., reporter, viewer).
*  **Knowledge of bugnote_id or rev_id:** The attacker needs to know or guess a valid bugnote ID or revision ID that exists within the system to exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing the revisions page.

**Additional details:**

* The fix implemented in commit `e9fd168c519a46c2cd0f3cb835e9ce5dba77fc4d` addresses this vulnerability by ensuring that access to the `bug_revision_view_page.php` is properly controlled. The fix now checks if the user has permission to view bugnote revisions (`access_can_view_bugnote_revisions`) or bug revisions (`access_can_view_bug_revisions`) before showing the revision details.
*   The issue was initially reported as only disclosing the summary but later, after investigation, it was found that the `bugnote` IDs were also disclosed.
* The fix for this vulnerability also fixed the inconsistency between the "View Revisions" link on the bug note page and direct access to `bug_revision_view_page.php`.
