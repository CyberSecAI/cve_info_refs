{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'sql' parameter before using it in a response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's response. When a user views the affected page, the attacker's script will execute within the user's browser in the context of the vulnerable domain. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the `/plugins/dbaccess/db-access.jsp` endpoint with a crafted 'sql' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No special position is mentioned. The user also needs to be logged into the application."
