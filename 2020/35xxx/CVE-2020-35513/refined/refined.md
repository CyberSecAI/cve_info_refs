Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35513:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure in the NFS server (nfsd) to properly clear the umask after processing an open or create operation. This can lead to incorrect permissions being set on newly created objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect umask handling:** The NFS server was not resetting the umask after operations, potentially using a umask from a previous operation or request on subsequent operations by the same thread.
- **NFSv4 compound request issue:** The umask was being set during the decoding of the compound request, not at the time of the actual operation. This could lead to the wrong umask being used if multiple create operations with different umasks were present in a single compound request, using the umask of the last operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect file permissions:** An attacker could potentially influence the permissions of newly created files or directories by manipulating the umask.
- **Denial of Service:** Although rated as low impact, the bug report notes that a user with access to the NFS could use the flaw to "starve the resources causing denial of service".
- **Resource Starvation:** The incorrect umask could be exploited to limit or reduce access to created resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **NFSv4 Client:** A malicious actor would need to be using a NFSv4 client, which can interact with the vulnerable NFS server.
- **NFS Server access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create files or directories on an NFS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **NFS Access:** The attacker must have access to an NFS server that is vulnerable.
- **NFSv4 Client:** The attacker has to use an NFSv4 client to trigger the vulnerability.
- **File/Directory Creation:**  The attacker needs to be able to perform file or directory creation or modification operations using NFSv4.2 or newer.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to the NFS server implementation.
- The fix involves saving the umask during decode and applying it at the time of the file/directory operation and clearing it immediately after.
- The impact is considered low, as an attacker can only reduce permissions of a file or directory, not increase them.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Linux kernel 4.17-rc1 and backported to stable kernels for Red Hat distributions.
- The bug report references a patch from 2018, suggesting the issue existed for some time.
