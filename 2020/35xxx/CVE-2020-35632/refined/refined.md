Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2020-35632:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2020-35632, as well as the other related CVEs, lies in the lack of proper bounds checking when parsing Nef polygon data within the CGAL library. Specifically, when reading vertex, edge, face, and volume data from a specially crafted input file, the code reads integer values representing indices into various data vectors. These indices are then used to access elements in the vectors without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the unchecked use of parsed indices.  The code reads an index from the input file and uses it to access a vector (e.g., `Edge_of[index]`, `Vertex_of[index]`, `SFace_of[index]`). If the index is negative or greater than or equal to the vector size, an out-of-bounds read occurs.
-   **Type Confusion:** The out-of-bounds read leads to type confusion. By manipulating the index, an attacker can make the code access memory that is not intended, potentially treating data of one type as a different type.
-   **Lack of Input Validation:** The parsing functions lack appropriate checks on the input data, specifically the indices read from the file. This allows an attacker to provide arbitrary values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Code Execution:** The combination of out-of-bounds reads and type confusion can be exploited by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious input file, an attacker can overwrite memory locations, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Input File:** The primary attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted, malformed input file to a program that uses the vulnerable CGAL library to parse Nef polygon data. The file will contain manipulated index values to trigger the out-of-bounds reads and type confusion.
-   **Remote Exploitation**: The Gentoo advisory classifies the vulnerability as remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must be able to provide a crafted input file to a vulnerable application.
-   The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Details Specific to CVE-2020-35632:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_sface()` function.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered at `sfh->boundary_entry_objects().push_back(make_object(Edge_of[index]));` where the index comes from the input file.
- The vulnerability can lead to type confusion and code execution.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The Talos report provides detailed code snippets demonstrating the vulnerable locations.
-   The Debian advisory lists this vulnerability among a large number of similar vulnerabilities within CGAL.
-   The vulnerability exists in CGAL versions prior to 5.4.1, according to the Gentoo advisory.
