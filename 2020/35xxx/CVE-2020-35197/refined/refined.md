Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-35197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The official memcached docker images prior to version 1.5.11-alpine (specifically the Alpine-based images) contain a blank password for the root user within the `/etc/shadow` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Empty Root Password:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a blank password for the root user in the `/etc/shadow` file. This is a severe security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Root Access:** A remote attacker can potentially gain root access to the system running the vulnerable memcached docker container using the blank password.
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the host system or within the container.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can disrupt services by crashing the container or the host.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A remote attacker gains root privileges, potentially affecting the entire system beyond the memcached service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Memcached Docker Image:** The vulnerability exists within the memcached docker image itself. Specifically, the alpine based images are affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable memcached docker container.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default blank password for the root user in the vulnerable docker images.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all alpine specific docker images below version 1.5.11-alpine.
*   Versions 1.5.11-alpine and 1.4.26-alpine are specifically called out as affected.
