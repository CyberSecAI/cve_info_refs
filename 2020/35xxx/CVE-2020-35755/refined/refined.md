{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `luci_service` daemon, running on TCP port 7777, lacks proper authentication for its 'Read_' commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authentication. The `luci_service` daemon allows unauthenticated users to execute commands that read sensitive information from the device's NVRAM.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information such as Wi-Fi passwords, web management interface passwords, and connected account tokens (e.g., Spotify tokens) in cleartext. This could lead to unauthorized access to the network, device, and linked services.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the device on TCP port 7777.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and be able to connect to TCP port 7777."
