  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-35654",
    "description": "Decoding crafted YCbCr files could result in heap-based buffer overflow",
    "affected_component": "python-pillow",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the python-pillow library handles the decoding of crafted YCbCr files, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
     "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability occurs during the decoding process when a crafted YCbCr file is processed. The library does not properly validate the dimensions or size parameters of the YCbCr data resulting in an attempt to allocate an improper memory size for the decoded data. This can overwrite memory regions leading to memory corruption or program crash.",
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Memory corruption may occur resulting in program crash or other unstable behaviour",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a specially crafted YCbCr image file that triggers the vulnerability during the decoding process.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted YCbCr image file to an application using python-pillow. Exploitation does not require any specific privileges.",
        "additional_information": "The provided information indicates that the fix for this vulnerability was initially insufficient, requiring subsequent patches."
