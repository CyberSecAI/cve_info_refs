{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the 'street' parameter of the '/ajax.php?action=save_branch' endpoint.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure of the entire database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted POST request to the '/ajax.php?action=save_branch' endpoint. The 'street' parameter within the multipart/form-data is injected with malicious SQL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the 'new_branch' page and capture the request to the vulnerable endpoint via a tool like Burp Suite. The attacker should also have knowledge of SQL injection techniques."
