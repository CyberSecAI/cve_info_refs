Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-35590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the client IP address within the "Limit Login Attempts Reloaded" WordPress plugin. Specifically, when the plugin is configured to trust an arbitrary HTTP header for the client's IP address (e.g., "X-Forwarded-For"), it fails to validate whether the header's value is a valid IP address or an array of IP addresses. This allows an attacker to bypass rate limiting by sending requests with randomized, non-IP values in the configured header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate the input from the custom HTTP header used to determine the client's IP address.
*   **Rate Limit Bypass:** By manipulating the custom HTTP header, an attacker can bypass the plugin's login attempt rate limiting mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** An attacker can conduct unrestricted brute-force attacks against WordPress login pages, trying numerous username and password combinations, increasing the chance of gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker crafts HTTP POST requests to the `wp-login.php` endpoint, including the manipulated custom HTTP header with each request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **Configuration Awareness:** The attacker needs to know that the plugin's "Trusted IP Origins" setting has been configured to use a custom HTTP header.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Limit Login Attempts Reloaded" plugin greater than or equal to 2.13.0.
*   The official description is: "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts"
*   The attacker can randomize the value of the custom header (e.g., "X-Forwarded-For") to bypass the rate limit, because the plugin does not validate the header to contain a valid IP address.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is available at: `https://github.com/N4nj0/CVE-2020-35590`
*   The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 9.8
