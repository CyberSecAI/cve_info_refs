The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35939.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `post_grid_import_xml_layouts` and `team_import_xml_layouts` functions in the Post Grid and Team Showcase WordPress plugins, respectively, unserialize a user-supplied `source` parameter, leading to PHP Object Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data (the `source` parameter).
- The use of `unserialize()` on a file retrieved based on the `source` parameter, which could contain a serialized PHP object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution if a vulnerable magic method is present in another plugin.
- Ability to delete or write files on the server.
- Potential site takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending an AJAX request with the `action` set to `post_grid_import_xml_layouts` or `team_import_xml_layouts` and a crafted `source` parameter.
-  Triggering the `post_grid_import_xml_layouts` via a shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  A logged-in user with at least subscriber privileges can exploit the vulnerability.
-  If a site uses a plugin/theme allowing unauthenticated shortcode execution, an attacker does not require an account.
