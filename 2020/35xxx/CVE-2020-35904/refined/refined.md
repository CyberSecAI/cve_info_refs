  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-35904",
      "root_cause": "The `bounded` channel in the affected versions of the `crossbeam-channel` crate incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` allocates capacity equal to the number of iterator elements. However, `Vec::from_iter` may allocate extra memory. When the destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs a `Vec` from a raw pointer, it uses the incorrect capacity, which leads to a deallocation with the incorrect size.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect buffer size calculation",
        "Use of raw pointers without proper length tracking",
        "Incorrect memory deallocation"
