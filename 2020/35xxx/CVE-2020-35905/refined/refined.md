Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-35905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unsound `Send` and `Sync` implementation for `MappedMutexGuard` in the `futures-util` crate. The implementation only considered variance on the type `T` while `MappedMutexGuard` dereferences to `U`. This discrepancy allows for the creation of a `MappedMutexGuard` that provides access to a type `U` unrelated to the original type `T` protected by the mutex.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect `Send` and `Sync` trait implementations for `MappedMutexGuard`.
- The `MappedMutexGuard` dereferences to a type `U` without considering `U`'s variance when determining thread-safety.
- Potential for data races due to the ability to share access to type `U` across threads without proper synchronization when `U` is unrelated to `T`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data races can occur in safe Rust code, leading to undefined behavior.
- The provided code example demonstrates a data race on the reference counter of `Rc`, where the strong_count varies across runs due to the race condition instead of being consistent.
- Potential for program crashes, memory corruption, or other unpredictable behavior.
- High availability impact due to potential crashes and unstable program behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack vector as the code needs to be executed on the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to execute code that utilizes the vulnerable `futures-util` crate versions.
- The attacker needs to construct a scenario where `MutexGuard::map()` is used with a closure returning a type `U` that is unrelated to the original mutex type `T`.
- Low privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is present in versions `>=0.3.2` and `<0.3.7` of the `futures-util` crate.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version `0.3.7` by correcting the `Send` and `Sync` implementations and adding a `PhantomData<&'a mut U>` marker to `MappedMutexGuard`.
- The CVSS score is 4.7, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`. This indicates a local attack vector, high complexity, low privileges, no user interaction, unchanged scope, no confidentiality or integrity impact, and a high impact on availability.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-362 (Race Condition).
- The GitHub issue #2239 provides a detailed explanation and a demonstration of the data race.
