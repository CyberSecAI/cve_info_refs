Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35863:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `hyper` library handles HTTP GET requests. Specifically, vulnerable versions of `hyper` allow GET requests to have bodies even when there's no `Transfer-Encoding` or `Content-Length` header specified. According to the HTTP 1.1 specification, GET requests without these headers should not have bodies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The core weakness is that `hyper` incorrectly interprets the body of a GET request (when the headers don't indicate a body should be present) as a new, separate HTTP request. This allows for request smuggling.
- **Incorrect Handling of GET Request Bodies:** The library fails to adhere to the HTTP 1.1 specification regarding GET requests and their expected lack of bodies (without specific headers).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **CORS Bypass:** An attacker can inject arbitrary headers into a request, which can bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities (such as an exploitable web server listening on the loopback interface), an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution. The attacker would craft a malicious request, using the request smuggling to make a request to a local service that is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Control Over HTTP Request Body:** The attacker needs to control the body and method of an HTTP request made by the `hyper` library. This could be achieved through a variety of means: Man-in-the-Middle attacks, or injection of malicious inputs into an application that uses the vulnerable hyper library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request with a body that will be processed by a vulnerable version of the `hyper` library.
- No specific privileges or user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability was corrected in hyper version 0.12.34.
* The vulnerability is present in versions of hyper >= 0.11.0 and < 0.12.34.
* The issue was originally reported in September of 2019, and a fix was merged in December 2014. However, the vulnerability was not fully addressed until the release of version 0.12.34 in 2020.
* The provided content includes the CVSS v3 base metrics, providing a score of 9.8, with network attack vector, low complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction, unchanged scope, and high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
