## Package

cargo

hyper
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.11.0, < 0.12.34

## Patched versions

0.12.34

## Description

Vulnerable versions of hyper allow GET requests to have bodies, even if there is no Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header. As per the HTTP 1.1 specification, such requests do not have bodies, so the body will be interpreted as a separate HTTP request.

This allows an attacker who can control the body and method of an HTTP request made by hyper to inject a request with headers that would not otherwise be allowed, as demonstrated by sending a malformed HTTP request from a Substrate runtime. This allows bypassing CORS restrictions. In combination with other vulnerabilities, such as an exploitable web server listening on loopback, it may allow remote code execution.

The flaw was corrected in hyper version 0.12.34.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@seanmonstar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4&size=48)[seanmonstar](https://github.com/seanmonstar)opened [on Sep 4, 2019](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1925#issue-489354901)

The client wrongly strips `transfer-encoding: chunked` from GET requests, thinking that GET requests shouldn't have payloads. However, [that's not explicitly true](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1):

> A payload within a GET request message has no defined semantics;
>
> sending a payload body on a GET request might cause some existing
>
> implementations to reject the request.

The original implementation was trying to protect from empty `Body::wrap_stream(some_empty_stream)`s automatically adding `transfer-encoding: chunked` to a GET request.

**The fix** should probably still protect against that, but if the `transfer-encoding` header has been explicitly set on the `Request`, it should be forwarded as-is.
