  "CVE-2020-35728": {
    "Description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.8 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to com.oracle.wls.shaded.org.apache.xalan.lib.sql.JNDIConnectionPool (aka embedded Xalan in org.glassfish.web/javax.servlet.jsp.jstl).",
    "Root cause": "Mishandling of the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, specifically related to the `com.oracle.wls.shaded.org.apache.xalan.lib.sql.JNDIConnectionPool` class (embedded Xalan) and similar gadget classes.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Serialization gadget exploit",
       "Mishandling of interaction between serialization gadgets and typing"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker must send a malicious JSON payload. They can be remote (network access). No privileges or user interaction are required.",
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability stems from the way jackson-databind handles deserialization and typing, which allows an attacker to create and initialize instances of specific 'gadget' classes, potentially leading to code execution.",
      "The vulnerability is related to the class 'com.oracle.wls.shaded.org.apache.xalan.lib.sql.JNDIConnectionPool' (embedded Xalan).",
      "A fix is included in version 2.9.10.8 and 2.6.7.5."
