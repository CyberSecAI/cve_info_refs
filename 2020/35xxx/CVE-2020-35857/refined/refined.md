Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35857:

**Root Cause:** A stack overflow occurs due to the way `trust-dns-server` processes additional records when returning MX or SRV record types. This happens specifically when a DNS zone is configured with a null target ('.') for these record types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** The vulnerability is a stack overflow, which can lead to a crash and denial of service.
*   **Improper Handling of Null Targets:** The `trust-dns-server` does not correctly handle MX or SRV records that point to a null target ('.'), leading to infinite recursion while processing additional records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the DNS server, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Specifically Crafted DNS Queries:** The attack requires sending a DNS query that requests MX or SRV records from a zone that has a null target configured for those records.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Send DNS Queries:** The attacker must be able to send DNS queries to the target server.
*   **No Authentication/Privileges Required:** No special privileges or user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of `trust-dns-server` from 0.16.0 up to (but not including) 0.18.1 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.18.1 of `trust-dns-server`.
*   **Workaround:** If upgrading is not possible, users are advised to avoid using MX, SRV, or similar records with a null target.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, which is considered high severity.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).
