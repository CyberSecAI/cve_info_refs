Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient anti-enumeration mechanisms for the administrator password in Mersive Solstice Pods. Specifically, there are no measures in place to prevent brute-force attacks against the administrator password through the Solstice Open Control API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Rate Limiting or Lockout:** The system does not implement any form of rate limiting or account lockout after multiple failed password attempts.
*   **No Complexity Requirements:** The administrator password is not subject to any complexity constraints, making it susceptible to dictionary and brute-force attacks.
*   **Consistent Error Response:** The Solstice Pod returns a consistent JSON response (`{ "passwordRequired": true }`) for incorrect password attempts. This allows an attacker to easily automate the guessing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the administrative interface of the Solstice Pod. This could lead to complete control of the device, including configuration changes, access to sensitive data, and potentially further attacks on the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is the Solstice Open Control API. An attacker sends HTTP GET requests to the `/Config/service/initModel` endpoint, attempting different passwords in the `password` parameter.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network, as the API is accessible over HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Solstice Pod.
*   No prior authentication is required to attempt password guessing, the API is exposed for anyone to query.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Mersive Solstice Pods running firmware prior to version 3.3.0 (May 2018) or 4.3 (15966) (November 2019).
*   The provided text includes example requests and responses, which clarify how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The `documentation.mersive.com` link redirects to release notes, which state that security enhancements were made in version 3.3.0 and 4.3 to address brute-force attacks.
