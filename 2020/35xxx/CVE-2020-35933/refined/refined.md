  "CVE-2020-35933": {
    "Description": "The Newsletter plugin includes a full-featured visual editor that can be used to create visually appealing newsletters and email campaigns. It uses an AJAX function, `tnpc_render_callback`, to display edited blocks based on a set of options sent in the AJAX request. Unfortunately, the vulnerable versions did not filter these options, but passed them onto a second function, `restore_options_from_request` which used multiple methods to decode options that were passed in before displaying them using the `render_block` function.",
    "Root cause": "The plugin did not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering blocks in the visual editor via AJAX, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed in a logged-in user's browser, potentially leading to the injection of backdoors or the addition of malicious administrative users.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `tnpc_render`, the `b` parameter set to `html`, and the `options` parameter set to arbitrary JavaScript.",
      "Sending a POST request with the `options` parameter set to an empty array `options[]=` and the `encoded_options` parameter set to a base64-encoded JSON string containing arbitrary JavaScript."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing a specific action (e.g. clicking a specially crafted link).",
     "Patched version": "6.8.2"
  }
