Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-35510:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in jboss-remoting, where the EJB server's threads can be held up indefinitely. This occurs when an EJB client sends a sequence of bytes corresponding to a successful request but omits the ACK messages or when jboss-remoting code is tampered with to prevent sending of ACK messages from the EJB client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of missing ACK messages from EJB clients.
- Vulnerability to tampering of jboss-remoting code to prevent sending of ACK messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial of service, where the server becomes unavailable due to threads being held up indefinitely.
- System Availability: The vulnerability poses a high threat to system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious EJB client: An attacker can send a crafted sequence of bytes simulating a successful EJB client request but deliberately omitting the required ACK messages.
- Code tampering: An attacker can directly modify the jboss-remoting code to prevent the sending of ACK messages from the EJB client side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the EJB server as an EJB client.
- The attacker needs to be able to send custom byte sequences to the EJB server, or have the ability to tamper the jboss-remoting code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in jboss-remoting version 5.0.20.SP1-redhat-00001.
- The vulnerability is out of scope for Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 6 & 5, Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3, Red Hat Data Grid 7, Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5, Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6, Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6, Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6, and Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.
- It is marked as low impact for Red Hat Fuse 7 as it distributes affected versions but does not use the vulnerable functionality.
- The issue has been addressed in multiple products via several RHSA errata including Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4.6, and Red Hat Fuse 7.10.
