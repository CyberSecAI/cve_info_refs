The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This advisory does not correspond to CVE-2020-35838 as it is related to vulnerability PSV-2018-0509.

Based on the provided information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the web interface of several NETGEAR router models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the router's web interface which are then stored and executed when other users access the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session when they access the router's web interface. This could lead to unauthorized access, session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected NETGEAR router models. An attacker would need to find an input field or area that is vulnerable to script injection, input the malicious script, and then have a victim access a page on the router's admin interface to trigger it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to access the web interface of the router. It is likely that the attacker would need to be an authenticated user of the router, which often requires valid login credentials. However, specific details are not provided.
- An attacker with administrative access could potentially inject malicious scripts that could affect other users of the administrative interface.
