Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of URLs in the background collection management feature of the yzmcms application. Specifically, the application attempts to fetch content from provided URLs using either `curl_exec` (if the curl extension is available) or `file_get_contents`. The issue lies in the URL validation which only checks if the first four characters of a provided string are "http," and this check is insufficient to prevent Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Insufficient URL Validation:** The application uses `substr` to check if the URL starts with "http", which is not enough. It does not properly validate the protocol and allows for other protocols to be used.
2.  **PHP Protocol Handling:** PHP's behavior when encountering unknown protocols can result in the protocol being set to `null`. When the protocol is null or "file", local file operations are performed by default.
3.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By exploiting the above weaknesses, an attacker can provide a custom protocol (e.g., `httpxxx`), which bypasses the initial "http" check. The system then treats it as a local file operation request, thus enabling the attacker to read local files such as `/etc/passwd`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files, database credentials, or system user details. In the provided example, the attacker successfully reads the content of `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Through the "collection management" feature:** An attacker needs to log in to the background management interface of the yzmcms application, create a new node in collection management, and add a malicious URL in the form of custom protocol such as `httpxxx:///etc/passwd`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the yzmcms background management:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to access the administration panel of the yzmcms application.
*   **Ability to create/modify collection nodes:** The attacker must be able to add or modify collection nodes in the "collection management" section of the admin panel.
