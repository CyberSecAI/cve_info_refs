Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-35630:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper bounds checking when reading indices from a file during the parsing of Nef polygon data in the CGAL library. Specifically, the `SNC_io_parser::read_sface()` function does not validate the index before using it to access the `Vertex_of` vector, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser::read_sface() sfh->center_vertex()`. This occurs because the code reads an integer from the input file, which is then used as an index into the `Vertex_of` vector, without any validation. If a crafted file provides a large or negative index, the code will try to read outside of the allocated memory for `Vertex_of`.
- **Type confusion:** The out-of-bounds read, which reads arbitrary memory due to the missing check, can lead to type confusion. This occurs when the program interprets data of one type as another. This can have severe consequences, including the ability to gain control of the program's execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code execution:** The primary impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution. Because an attacker can control the memory being accessed, they can potentially overwrite parts of the program's memory or control its execution flow, enabling them to execute arbitrary code on the victim machine.
- **Crash:** If the arbitrary memory access doesn't overwrite critical information or lead to a state allowing code execution, it will likely lead to a crash of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious input file:** The attack vector is providing a specially crafted, malformed `.nef3` file to an application that utilizes the vulnerable CGAL library to parse the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to supply malicious input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious `.nef3` file to an application that uses the vulnerable CGAL library. This could be achieved in various ways, such as:
    - Having the user open a malicious file in an application using CGAL.
    - Exploiting a service parsing untrusted input using CGAL.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability exists in the following code snippet from `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h`:

```c++
template <typename EW>
bool SNC_io_parser<EW>::
read_sface(SFace_handle sfh) {

  bool OK = true;
  int index;
  char cc;

  in >> index;
  OK = OK && test_string("{");

  in >> index;
  sfh->center_vertex() = Vertex_of[index]; // <- oob read here
```

The code reads an `index` value from the input stream (`in`) and directly uses it to access the `Vertex_of` vector without validation. This allows for an attacker to provide a manipulated index causing an out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities in the CGAL library's Nef polygon parsing code.
- The vulnerability is present in CGAL versions prior to 5.4.1.
- Patches have been made available by the vendor to address the issue.
