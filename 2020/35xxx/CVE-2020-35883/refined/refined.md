Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35883:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `mozwire` client software downloads a list of servers from Mozilla's servers. It uses the hostname field from the JSON document to create local files, and does not sanitize this field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The lack of sanitization of the hostname allows an attacker to insert `../` sequences in the hostname, leading to path traversal.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The application blindly trusts the `hostname` field provided by the server without any checks for malicious characters or path traversal sequences.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local File Overwrite/Creation:** An attacker can overwrite or create local files ending in `.conf`.
- **Integrity and Availability Impact:** Overwriting critical configuration files could compromise the integrity of the system and potentially impact availability by disrupting services or system functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker needs to control the content of the JSON documents served by Mozilla's servers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in control of the data served from Mozilla's servers, as the `hostname` value is obtained from there. This suggests a compromise of the Mozilla server infrastructure is required.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on August 18, 2020, and patched in version `>0.4.1` (or 0.5.0 according to another source).
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.1.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-22, which is Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').
