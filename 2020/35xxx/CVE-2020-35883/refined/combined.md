### Description

The client software downloaded a list of servers from mozilla's servers and created local files named
after the hostname field in the json document.

No verification of the content of the string was made, and it could therefore have included '../' leading to path traversal.

This allows an attacker in control of mozilla's servers to overwrite/create local files named .conf.

The flaw was corrected by sanitizing the hostname field.

## Description

![@alexanderkjall](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/647710?v=4&size=48)[alexanderkjall](https://github.com/alexanderkjall)opened [on Aug 18, 2020](https://github.com/NilsIrl/MozWire/issues/14#issue-680956183)

I tried to read through the code prior to using it, and here:

<https://github.com/NilsIrl/MozWire/blob/trunk/src/main.rs#L442>

The `server.hostname` variable is used, as far as I can tell from the source code this value comes directly from the server and there is no checks to verify that it doesn't contain something that might cause a path traversal (i.e. ../ ).

I have not verified this in any way, as it was annoying to untangle the oauth things in front of it.

It also feels like a very low risk vulnerability, as the software is hardcoded to go against the mozilla servers.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
