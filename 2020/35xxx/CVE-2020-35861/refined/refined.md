Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `realloc` function of the `bumpalo` crate. When reallocating memory, the code was copying `new_size` bytes from the old allocation to the new space, instead of the correct `old_size` bytes. This could lead to reading data from memory beyond the intended allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read during the `realloc` operation. It reads from memory locations that are not part of the original allocation, potentially exposing sensitive data from adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially read data from memory locations they should not have access to. This could include sensitive information such as cryptographic keys or other confidential data present in memory after the allocated buffer.
- **Confidentiality breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to a breach of confidentiality, as attackers can read data from memory not intended for them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by causing reallocations.
- Indirectly, the `bumpalo::collections::Vec::resize` and `bumpalo::collections::Vec::shrink_to_fit` functions can trigger a reallocation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers must be able to cause reallocations within the `bumpalo` crate.
- Attackers must be able to read back the reallocated data to exploit the vulnerability.
- No privileges or user interaction are required.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `bumpalo` versions >= 3.0.0 and < 3.2.1.
- The issue was fixed in version 3.2.1.
- The fix includes a regression test and a quickcheck test to exercise the `realloc` function via `Vec::resize` and `Vec::shrink_to_fit`.
- The `valgrind` tests in CI were updated with the `--error-exitcode=1` flag to catch invalid reads/writes more effectively.
