### Description

When `realloc`ing, if we allocate new space, we need to copy the old
allocation's bytes into the new space. There are `old_size` number of bytes in
the old allocation, but we were accidentally copying `new_size` number of bytes,
which could lead to copying bytes into the realloc'd space from past the chunk
that we're bump allocating out of, from unknown memory.

If an attacker can cause `realloc`s, and can read the `realoc`ed data back,
this could allow them to read things from other regions of memory that they
shouldn't be able to. For example, if some crypto keys happened to live in
memory right after a chunk we were bump allocating out of, this could allow
the attacker to read the crypto keys.

Beyond just fixing the bug and adding a regression test, I've also taken two
additional steps:

1. While we were already running the testsuite under `valgrind` in CI, because
   `valgrind` exits with the same code that the program did, if there are
   invalid reads/writes that happen not to trigger a segfault, the program can
   still exit OK and we will be none the wiser. I've enabled the
   `--error-exitcode=1` flag for `valgrind` in CI so that tests eagerly fail
   in these scenarios.
2. I've written a quickcheck test to exercise `realloc`. Without the bug fix
   in this patch, this quickcheck immediately triggers invalid reads when run
   under `valgrind`. We didn't previously have quickchecks that exercised
   `realloc` because `realloc` isn't publicly exposed directly, and instead
   can only be indirectly called. This new quickcheck test exercises `realloc`
   via `bumpalo::collections::Vec::resize` and
   `bumpalo::collections::Vec::shrink_to_fit` calls.

I'm very confused and don't know what is wrong

when I run this code in unit test with `cargo test` it failed with SIGSEGV

Here is my test code

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
