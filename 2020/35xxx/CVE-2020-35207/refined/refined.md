Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE:** This content *potentially* relates to CVE-2020-35207. The provided Github repository `evilblazer/LastPassVulnerabilities` contains information and a document about vulnerabilities in the LastPass iOS app, including bypassing password authentication. While the CVE number isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the description of password bypass is relevant to this CVE which is related to a LastPass vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerabilities stem from the LastPass iOS application's reliance on local authentication mechanisms that can be bypassed on a jailbroken device. The repository details two bypass methods, one for password authentication and another for PIN authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Bypass of password authentication:** The application's lock screen password authentication can be bypassed.
*   **Bypass of PIN authentication:** The application's lock screen PIN authentication can also be bypassed.
*   **Reliance on Local Authentication:** The application relies on local authentication methods that are vulnerable on a jailbroken device.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to a jailbroken device where LastPass is installed could bypass the password or PIN protection and gain access to the user's LastPass vault, exposing all stored credentials and other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector involves:
1.  Having physical access to the victim's iOS device.
2. The device must be jailbroken.
3.  Exploiting a local authentication bypass to unlock the LastPass vault.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Physical access:** The attacker needs physical access to the victim's iOS device.
*   **Jailbroken device:** The targeted iOS device must be jailbroken for the exploit to work.
*   **Technical skill:** The attacker needs technical knowledge or tools to execute the bypasses documented in the linked resources.

**Additional Details:**
*   The github repository contains a word document with a detailed writeup of the vulnerability.
*   The repository also includes videos showcasing the exploits for both password and PIN bypass.
*   The developer has stated that the vendor declined to fix the issue due to the prerequisite of the device being jailbroken.
