Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in WonderCMS 3.1.3:

**1. Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the theme/plugin installer feature. Specifically, the `installUpdateThemePluginAction` function downloads a ZIP file from a provided URL, extracts it to a predictable directory (`data/plugins/folderplugin/`), and then renames the folder.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows downloading ZIP files from arbitrary URLs without sufficient validation.
    *   **Predictable Extraction Path:** The extracted files are placed in a predictable directory, allowing for direct access.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can upload a malicious ZIP file containing a PHP backdoor. Upon installation, the attacker can access this backdoor (e.g., `/data/plugins/folderplugin/evil.php`), gaining remote code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  The attacker must have valid admin credentials to access the theme/plugin installer feature.
    2.  The attacker crafts a malicious ZIP archive containing a PHP backdoor.
    3.  The attacker uses the installer to install the malicious ZIP file.
    4.  The attacker accesses the backdoor via the predictable path.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   Valid admin credentials for the WonderCMS instance.
    *   Ability to craft malicious ZIP files.

**2. Authenticated Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is in the `addCustomThemePluginRepository` function, used when installing a custom theme/plugin. The function attempts to filter allowed URLs based on the presence of `"https://github.com/"` or `"https://gitlab.com/"` using `strpos()`.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Weak Filter Bypass:** The `strpos()` check can easily be bypassed by including the string `"https://github.com/"` or `"https://gitlab.com/"` anywhere within the provided URL, even if the main part of the URL points to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Blind SSRF:** The vulnerability is "blind" as the response to the forged request is not reflected in the application's response, which limits the initial exploitation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can force the server to make requests to internal or external servers.
    *   This vulnerability can be escalated to RCE by targeting a vulnerable internal service. In the example given, the researcher targeted FastCGI via the gopher protocol.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  The attacker must have valid admin credentials to access the custom theme/plugin installer.
    2.  The attacker sets a crafted URL including `https://github.com/` or `https://gitlab.com/` but points to an attacker controlled server.
    3. The attacker crafts a gopher payload to target a vulnerable internal service like FastCGI.
    4.  The attacker uses the installer to make a request to the crafted URL.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   Valid admin credentials for the WonderCMS instance.
    *   Ability to craft malicious URLs with the weak filtering bypass.
    *   Knowledge of internal services (like FastCGI) that can be exploited through gopher scheme.

**Summary of the vulnerabilities:**

*   Both vulnerabilities require administrative access to the WonderCMS instance.
*   The RCE vulnerability allows for direct arbitrary code execution via a crafted plugin.
*   The SSRF vulnerability allows for the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs, which can be escalated to RCE through a vulnerable service like FastCGI.
* The SSRF vulnerability is present in both `addCustomThemePluginRepository` and `installUpdateThemePluginAction`, with `installUpdateThemePluginAction` being easier to exploit due to the absence of any filtering.
