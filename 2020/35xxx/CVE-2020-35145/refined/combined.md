Case study

Acronis True Image has saved my career on numerous occasions

“I was hit by a ransomware attack and a gentleman told me on the phone that I should pay a certain amount of money to get my data back. But in the back of my head, I knew that I had the ace card as I had Acronis True Image.”

**Eli Yablonovitch**
Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley

## What our users say

* Acronis True Image made cloning my old hard drive and moving to a new SSD a breeze. The cloning process was quick and simple, and I did not have to spend much time learning how to do it.  Show more

* I was always weary of backup software. It is bulky and complicated, and looks like it is designed for an astronaut. With Acronis, I finally found a tool to protect my data that I knew how to use from the first clicks.  Show more

* Nothing is scarier than watching your documents turning into rubbish. I am so glad it takes one click to bring it back with Acronis.  Show more
