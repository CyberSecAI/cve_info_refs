Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-35340:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `ExpertPdf` library's handling of user-provided HTML input during the HTML-to-PDF conversion process. Specifically, the library allows the use of the `<object>` tag with a `data` attribute pointing to a local file path, which results in the content of the local file being embedded in the generated PDF. The `AllowLocalAccess` property is enabled by default, allowing access to the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include local files by specifying their paths in the `data` attribute of the `<object>` tag.
*   **Unrestricted File Access:** The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing arbitrary file paths to be accessed if the application has permissions to read them.
*   **NTLM Hash Disclosure:** Using the `file://` protocol with the `<object>` tag allows for the retrieval of NTLM hashes by abusing SMB. This can be used to capture the hash of the account running the web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive local files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, source code, or other confidential information.
*   **NTLM Hash Theft:** By forcing the server to access a malicious SMB share (using `file://`), the attacker can capture the server's NTLM hash, which can be used to gain further access to the system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious HTML Input:** By injecting a crafted HTML snippet with a `<object>` tag that includes a local file path or a `file://` URL, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User-Controlled Input:** The vulnerability is exploitable when user-controlled data is passed to the conversion function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to inject HTML:** The attacker needs to have a way to inject HTML code into the input of the ExpertPDF library.
*   **Network access:** For NTLM hash theft via SMB, the attacker needs to have the ability to intercept the SMB traffic. This could be from a position on the same network or through a malicious SMB server.
*   **Knowledge of Server File Paths:**  The attacker benefits from prior knowledge of sensitive file paths on the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in ExpertPDF versions 9.5.0 through 14.1.0.
*   The vendor addressed the issue in version 15.0.0 by adding the `AllowLocalAccess` property that, when set to `false`, prevents access to the local file system.  Importantly, this property defaults to `true`, making it important for developers to disable.
* The provided code snippet demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability in a basic .NET web application.
