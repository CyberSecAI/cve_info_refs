Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-35889:

*   **Vulnerability:** Misbehaving `HandleLike` implementation can lead to memory safety violation in the `crayon` crate.
*   **Root Cause:** Unsafe code in `ObjectPool` has a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug. `ObjectPool` and `HandlePool` implicitly assume that `HandleLike` trait methods are pure (always return the same value). This assumption is unsound because `HandleLike` is a safe, public trait allowing custom implementations that may not adhere to this purity.
*   **Weakness:** The code relies on the `HandleLike` trait methods being pure, but the trait allows for custom, potentially impure implementations. This leads to a TOCTOU vulnerability where the handle's index can change between the check (`contains`) and the use (`get_unchecked`, `drop_in_place`).
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a custom implementation of the `HandleLike` trait where the `index()` method's return value can change, an attacker can cause the `ObjectPool` to access memory out of bounds or drop the same memory multiple times.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to memory safety violations, potentially causing a segmentation fault (crash) or other undefined behavior, leading to confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues. The CVSS score is 8.1 (HIGH), with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a custom `HandleLike` implementation.
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions <= 0.7.1 of the `crayon` crate are affected. No patched versions are available.

The provided code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by creating a custom `HandleLike` implementation (`MyHandle`) where the `index()` method's return value is toggled using an atomic boolean. This allows for a controlled time-of-check to time-of-use scenario, leading to a segmentation fault when accessing `pool.entries` with an out-of-bounds index.
