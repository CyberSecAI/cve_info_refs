The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35943.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a logic flaw in the `validate_ajax_request` function within the NextGen Gallery plugin. This function, intended to secure AJAX actions including image uploads, incorrectly allows requests to proceed if the `$_REQUEST[‘nonce’]` parameter is missing, instead of rejecting them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of proper nonce validation allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of an administrator.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload arbitrary image files, potentially containing malicious code such as webshells, due to the flawed nonce validation in AJAX upload requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a webshell or other executable PHP code is embedded within the uploaded image and later used as a "Legacy Template", it will be executed leading to RCE.
- **Potential Site Takeover:** Successful RCE gives the attacker full control over the compromised website.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Executable code within an uploaded image file used as a template could also lead to XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted request, typically embedded in a link, that tricks an administrator into performing an unwanted action.
- The attack exploits the CSRF vulnerability due to the inadequate nonce validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a link to initiate a CSRF attack.
- No specific pre-existing access is required, but the attacker does need an active admin session on the target site.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that bypasses nonce validation, which in this case, is done by omitting the nonce parameter.
