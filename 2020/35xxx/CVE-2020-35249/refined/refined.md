```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Name' field when adding a client, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view the client information. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the 'Name' field when adding a client via the web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application with a valid account (default 'root:root' credentials can be used) and must be able to add a new client."
