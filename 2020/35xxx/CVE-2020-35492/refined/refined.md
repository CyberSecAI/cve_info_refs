Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35492:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in cairo's image-compositor.c. This occurs when processing crafted input files, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow.
- Out-of-bounds write.
- Improper handling of input data in `image-compositor.c` within the cairo library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality: Potential exposure of sensitive data due to memory corruption.
- Integrity: Modification of arbitrary memory locations.
- System Availability: Denial of service of the application using the affected cairo functionality due to crashes or unexpected behavior.
- Stack smashing can occur.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file.
- This input file is processed by an application using the cairo library (e.g., LibreOffice, or any other application that uses cairo for image compositing).
- The attacker can convince a user to open a malicious file, or an application can process untrusted input via cairo.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious input file that triggers the vulnerability in cairo.
- The attacker does not need to be on the target system as the vulnerability can be triggered by a user opening the crafted file.
- The attacker needs to rely on user interaction or vulnerable software processing the crafted input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in LibreOffice, but the root cause is in the cairo graphics library.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 (specifically for Libreoffice) are not affected because the vulnerable code was introduced in a later version. However, RHEL 8 *is* affected if a vulnerable version of the cairo library is used.
- Cairo builds in RHEL 8 contain binary protections that limit the impact of this vulnerability.
- Gentoo addressed the issue by upgrading cairo to version 1.17.6, which contains the fix.
- The fix was introduced in the upstream commit <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/cairo/cairo/-/merge_requests/85/diffs?commit_id=03a820b173ed1fdef6ff14b4468f5dbc02ff59be>.
