## Package

cargo

internment
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.3.12, < 0.4.0

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

ArcIntern::drop has a race condition where it can release memory which is about to get another user. The new user will get a reference to freed memory.

This was fixed by serializing access to an interned object while it is being deallocated.

Versions prior to 0.3.12 used stronger locking which avoided the problem.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@ryzhyk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8323135?u=484771e56e25c96829501100990a84d0198996ea&v=4&size=48)[ryzhyk](https://github.com/ryzhyk)opened [on Apr 24, 2020](https://github.com/droundy/internment/issues/11#issue-606119464)

I believe this function has a potential race condition:

[internment/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/droundy/internment/blob/1d9703ff5184f4f3dbac1368d52976a5630d9966/src/lib.rs#L316)

Line 316
in
[1d9703f](/droundy/internment/commit/1d9703ff5184f4f3dbac1368d52976a5630d9966)

|  | let count\_was = unsafe { (\*self.pointer).count.fetch\_sub(1, Ordering::Release) }; |
| --- | --- |

If a concurrent thread creates a new `ArcIntern` with the same value as the one being destroyed after we drop the ref count but before we take the mutex, then removing an entry from the map creates a dangling pointer.

Version
`internment::ArcIntern::drop`

* `>=0.3.12`

### Description

`ArcIntern::drop` has a race condition where it can release memory
which is about to get another user. The new user will get a reference
to freed memory.

This was fixed by serializing access to an interned object while it
is being deallocated.

Versions prior to 0.3.12 used stronger locking which avoided the problem.
