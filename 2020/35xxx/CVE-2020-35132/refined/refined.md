{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `get_request` function within `lib/functions.php`. This function does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically when handling HTTP GET, POST, and REQUEST variables. Malicious values can be stored and later executed, leading to XSS when these values are displayed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET/POST/REQUEST parameter injection",
      "Stored XSS (malicious data is stored in LDAP and later displayed)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to modify attributes within phpLDAPadmin, which requires a valid user account. Exploitation occurs when an administrator or another user views the modified attributes.",
    "details": "The vulnerability is triggered when user-provided data is passed through `get_request` without proper sanitization and later displayed. This allows execution of malicious JavaScript payloads stored within the LDAP data. The fix involves implementing `htmlspecialchars` to sanitize user-provided values."
