- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new 'global\_lists' entry. Specifically, it does not properly encode HTML entities, leading to the execution of the injected script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack allows an authenticated malicious user to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the 'global\_lists' feature within the application. An authenticated user can insert malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. The attacker has to navigate to the global\_lists feature to add new lists and inject the payload.
