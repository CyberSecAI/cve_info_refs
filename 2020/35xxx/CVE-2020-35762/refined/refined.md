- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The 'fileurl' parameter in the bloofoxCMS application does not properly sanitize user input, specifically failing to prevent path traversal sequences like `../`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability. The application allows an attacker to specify file paths that are outside the intended directory, leading to access of arbitrary local files on the web server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read local files on the web server by crafting malicious URLs using the 'fileurl' parameter. This could expose sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or user data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `fileurl` parameter in the `admin/index.php?mode=settings&page=editor` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `fileurl` parameter by including path traversal sequences to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint in the bloofoxCMS application.
