  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw exists in the `x25_bind` function in `net/x25/af_x25.c` of the Linux kernel. The function uses `strlen()` to determine the length of a user-provided `x25_addr` array, which is not guaranteed to be null-terminated, leading to a read beyond the allocated buffer.",
