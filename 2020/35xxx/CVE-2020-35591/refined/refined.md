Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-35591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application does not generate a new session cookie (PHPSESSID) after a user successfully logs in. This allows an attacker to inject a predefined session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation (CWE-384):** The core vulnerability is that the application reuses the same session ID, even after successful login, making it susceptible to session fixation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Hijacking:** By injecting a known session ID, an attacker can gain access to a legitimate user's account after the user logs in, effectively hijacking the session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the `PHPSESSID` cookie parameter to set a predefined session ID.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While the primary vulnerability is session fixation, the provided content indicates that an attacker could leverage a separate reflected XSS vulnerability (CVE-2020-35592) to inject a malicious script that sets the `PHPSESSID` cookie, making it easier to exploit the session fixation vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to set or inject the PHPSESSID:** The attacker needs a way to make the victim's browser use a `PHPSESSID` value controlled by the attacker before the victim logs in. This could be done by exploiting XSS or social engineering.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must interact with the manipulated or malicious content. The victim needs to login after the session ID is injected for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability affects Pi-hole versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.1.1.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Pi-hole FTL v5.7 and Web v5.4.
*   The provided content explains how to exploit the issue. First, an attacker can use the XSS to inject an arbitrary `PHPSESSID`. Then, after the victim logs in with the injected `PHPSESSID`, the attacker can use that same `PHPSESSID` to gain access to the victim's account.
