Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35137:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2020-35137, linking it to a hardcoded API key within the MobileIron Mobile@Work agent, thus confirming it is related to the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of a hardcoded API key within the MobileIron Mobile@Work application. This key is used to authorize requests against the MobileIron discovery service, which is used to locate the authentication endpoint of a MobileIron MDM environment based on a user's email address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded API Key:** The primary vulnerability is the hardcoded API key, which is present in the application's source code.
*   **Lack of API Key Protection:** The API key is not protected through obfuscation or other security mechanisms in the mobile application.
*   **Reliance on Client-Side Secrets:** The security of the discovery service depends on the secrecy of the API key, which is compromised by being included in the client application.
*   **Discovery Service Misuse:** This API key is used to discover MobileIron authentication endpoints, which can expose the infrastructure of a target organization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Endpoint Discovery:** An unauthenticated attacker can use the hardcoded API key to discover the MobileIron authentication endpoint of an organization.
*   **Reconnaissance:** This information could be used to perform reconnaissance on the target organization and identify potential targets for further attack.
*   **Precursor to Other Attacks:** Discovery of the authentication endpoint is a necessary step for other attacks, such as account enumeration and authentication attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reverse Engineering:** Attackers can extract the API key by reverse-engineering the Mobile@Work application. This involves obtaining the application package (APK or IPA) and decompiling or decrypting it to reveal the embedded key.
*   **Network Requests:** Once the API key is extracted, an attacker can send requests to the MobileIron discovery service from any location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reverse Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to obtain and reverse-engineer the Mobile@Work application to extract the hardcoded API key.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MobileIron discovery service on the internet.

**Additional Information:**

*   The article mentions that MobileIron acknowledged this issue and will be reviewing alternative solutions.
*   The article links the vulnerability to CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials.
*   A tool named "rustyIron" was created to exploit this and other MobileIron vulnerabilities.

In summary, the vulnerability lies in the insecure storage of an API key inside the mobile application which can be extracted and used to discover the authentication endpoints of organizations using MobileIron.
