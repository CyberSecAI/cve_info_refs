{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `miow` crate incorrectly assumed that the memory layout of `std::net::SocketAddrV4` and `std::net::SocketAddrV6` matched the system's C representation `sockaddr`. It directly casted pointers to convert socket addresses to the system representation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory layout assumption",
      "Direct pointer casting without layout guarantees"
    ],
    "impact": "Invalid memory access can occur if the standard library changes the implementation of `SocketAddrV4` or `SocketAddrV6`. This could lead to undefined behavior and program crashes.",
