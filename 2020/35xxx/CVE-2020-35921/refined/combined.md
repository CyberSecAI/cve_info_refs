## Description

![@faern](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332294?u=3bb6f6f56169350ac9584ea7d84ba4949b3178ca&v=4&size=48)[faern](https://github.com/faern)opened [on Nov 13, 2020](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/miow/issues/38#issue-742838875)

`miow` assumes that the memory layout of `std::net::SocketAddrV{4,6}` matches `libc::sockaddr`, but this can't be assumed. `std` makes no such promise to the outside world.

The offending code is here:

[miow/src/net.rs](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/miow/blob/c86373961b97eba692374435e93b81871af3f611/src/net.rs#L459-L470)

Lines 459 to 470
in
[c863739](/yoshuawuyts/miow/commit/c86373961b97eba692374435e93b81871af3f611)

|  | fn socket\_addr\_to\_ptrs(addr: &SocketAddr) -> (\*const SOCKADDR, c\_int) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | match \*addr { |
|  | SocketAddr::V4(ref a) => ( |
|  | a as \*const \_ as \*const \_, |
|  | mem::size\_of::<SOCKADDR\_IN>() as c\_int, |
|  | ), |
|  | SocketAddr::V6(ref a) => ( |
|  | a as \*const \_ as \*const \_, |
|  | mem::size\_of::<SOCKADDR\_IN6\_LH>() as c\_int, |
|  | ), |
|  | } |
|  | } |

Some other crates made the same assumptions, and they are being fixed in [tokio-rs/mio#1388](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1388), [rust-lang/socket2#120](https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2/pull/120) and [deprecrated/net2-rs#106](https://github.com/deprecrated/net2-rs/pull/106).

Until this is fixed and published it kind of blocks moving these fundamental network types into `core` and also stops them from having `const fn` constructors. See this PR on `std` for reference: [rust-lang/rust#78802](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78802).

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

The miow crate has assumed std::net::SocketAddrV4 and std::net::SocketAddrV6 have the same memory layout as the system C representation sockaddr. It has simply casted the pointers to convert the socket addresses to the system representation. The standard library does not say anything about the memory layout, and this will cause invalid memory access if the standard library changes the implementation. No warnings or errors will be emitted once the change happens.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@viperscape](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3178836?u=67e5a42ac90342b1a8094620ee3e14e6a699494f&v=4&size=48)[viperscape](https://github.com/viperscape)opened [on Dec 2, 2015](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/miow/issues/3#issue-119959813)

Should this throw a wsarecv error for shutdown of socket? It does not; is this expected?

```
fn recv_test() {
    let mut cp = CompletionPort::new(10).unwrap();
    let server = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:6000").unwrap();

    let j = thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut client = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:6000").unwrap();
        thread::sleep_ms(50); // wait for server to add socket to iocp, just in case for this test
        client.shutdown(std::net::Shutdown::Both);
        drop(client);
    });

    let mut server = server.incoming().next().unwrap().unwrap(); // client and server threads are unblocked now
    cp.add_socket(99,&server);
    thread::sleep_ms(120); // sleep while the client thread shuts down
    let mut buf = [0;10];
    unsafe { server.read_overlapped(&mut buf,&mut Overlapped::zero()); }

    let r = cp.get(None).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}",r);
}
```

prints:

```
CompletionStatus(OVERLAPPED_ENTRY { lpCompletionKey: 99, lpOverlapped: 0x3dffc68, Internal: 0, dwNumberOfBytesTransferred: 0 })

```
