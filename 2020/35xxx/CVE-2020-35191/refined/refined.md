{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The official Drupal Docker images, specifically the Alpine-based versions before 8.5.10-fpm-alpine, contained a blank password for the root user in the `/etc/shadow` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Empty Password in Configuration File"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could gain root access to systems using the affected Drupal Docker container by logging in with a blank password. This could lead to code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation, and information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is present in the Drupal Docker image itself.",
       "Specifically, Alpine-based versions 8.5.10-fpm-alpine through 8.3.0-rc2-fpm-alpine are affected."
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the container. No special authentication or exploit is required, they just need to connect and login with the blank root password."
