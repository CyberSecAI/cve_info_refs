Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35196:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content, specifically from `github.com_f367c073_20250119_134244.html` and `github.com_d6ba465a_20250119_115725.html`, directly relates to CVE-2020-35196, detailing the vulnerability and its impact. It is about a specific issue in the `rabbitmq` Docker image.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the presence of a blank password for the root user in the `/etc/shadow` file within the official `rabbitmq` Docker images before version `3.7.13-beta.1-management-alpine` (specifically the Alpine-based images).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the use of an empty password for the root user, leading to a critical security flaw. This is categorized as an "Empty Password in Configuration File" vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the container.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be used to cause a denial of service.
    *   **Escalation of Privileges:** An attacker can gain root access within the container.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker may be able to access sensitive data within the container.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the affected `rabbitmq` Docker images. An attacker can achieve remote access by exploiting the blank root password.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker with network access to a system running a vulnerable `rabbitmq` container can exploit this vulnerability. No prior authentication is required to gain root access.

**3. Additional Notes**
