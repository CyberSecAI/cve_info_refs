  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The LDAP server was returning specific error messages that revealed information about the existence of entries during the bind operation. Specifically, it was returning 'No such entry' (LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT) if a bind was attempted on a non-existent entry, and 'inappropriate authentication' (LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_AUTH) if the entry exists, but did not have 'userpassword' set. This allowed unauthenticated users to enumerate existing entries in the directory.",

      "Information Disclosure",
      "Lack of consistent error responses"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker could determine if a specific DN exists in the directory without having valid credentials. This information could be used in further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the LDAP bind operation. An attacker sends a bind request with a target DN, and analyzes the error message to determine the DN's existence.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the LDAP service."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The server now returns `LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS` (error 49) in all cases where the bind fails for invalid credentials. This includes cases where the DN does not exist, or the userpassword is not set. This prevents information disclosure via bind errors."
