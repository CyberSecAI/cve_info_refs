Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35687:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the PHP-Fusion CMS, specifically in the shoutbox message deletion functionality. The application uses a GET request to delete shoutbox messages which can be easily triggered by a malicious HTML form without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection. It does not implement an anti-CSRF token to validate the origin of the delete request.
- **GET Method Misuse:** The application uses GET requests for state-changing operations (deleting shoutbox messages). This makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks as GET requests can be easily triggered without user interaction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete shoutbox messages.
- By manipulating the `shout_id` parameter, an attacker can delete any shoutbox message of a logged in admin.
- Potentially leads to information loss or disruption of communication on the platform.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- This page can be sent to a logged-in admin through phishing or by embedding it in a site they visit.
- When the admin visits the attacker's page, the form will automatically submit a delete request, without the admin's explicit consent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable endpoint and the parameter name that is used to specify the shoutbox message id (shout_id).
- The attacker needs to entice or trick a logged-in admin to visit a malicious page crafted by the attacker to initiate the CSRF attack.
- The attacker also needs to be aware that the shout_id is sequential, and thus, can be guessed.
