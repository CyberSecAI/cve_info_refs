Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-35592:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The application fails to properly sanitize the HTTP `Origin` header, reflecting unsanitized user-supplied data back to the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79)
- Lack of sanitization of the `Origin` header
- Missing `HttpOnly` flag on the `PHPSESSID` cookie when initially assigned.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into a user's browser by crafting a malicious HTTP request and tricking a user into visiting a malicious page.
- Session cookie theft is possible due to the missing `HttpOnly` flag.
- This can lead to account compromise, data theft, phishing attacks, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack is achieved by crafting a malicious HTTP request, specifically by injecting malicious code into the `Origin` header.
-  This requires user interaction, as the victim needs to be tricked into accessing the attacker-controlled resource (e.g. a website) that generates the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request with a malicious `Origin` header.
- The attacker needs to trick a user, who has an active session with Pi-hole, into accessing a malicious page controlled by the attacker.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Pi-hole versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.1.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Pi-hole FTL v5.7 and Web v5.4.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.4 (Medium).

The provided text also mentions a Session Fixation vulnerability (CVE-2020-35591), which can be exploited in conjunction with this XSS vulnerability, but that is a separate issue.
