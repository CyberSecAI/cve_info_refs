{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when registering a new user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The 'Full Name' field in the user registration form does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided input, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "When an administrator views the user in the admin panel, the stored JavaScript payload is executed within the administrator's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the 'Full Name' field during user registration.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to access the user registration page and fill the 'Full Name' parameter with a malicious payload. No special privileges or administrator access is needed to inject the payload."
