Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35190

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of a blank password for the root user within the `/etc/shadow` file of the official Plone Docker images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An empty password for the root user. This violates the principle of least privilege and provides an easy path for unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Code Execution:** A remote attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can disrupt the service by taking control of the system.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** An attacker can gain root access from an initial lower-privileged access point.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with root access can access sensitive information on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the vulnerable Plone Docker image. Specifically, affected versions of the official plone docker images before version 4.3.18-alpine (Alpine specific).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with a system using the affected Plone Docker container. This could mean accessing a publicly facing service, or internal system if the vulnerable service is deployed within a private network.
- The attacker needs to know that the root user has a blank password which is common knowledge for this CVE and can be found in the description.

**Affected Product Code Base:**
- plone docker - 4.3.18-alpine
- plone docker - 5.1.5-alpine
- plone docker - 5.1.4-alpine
- plone docker - 5.1.2-alpine
- plone docker - 4.3.17-alpine
- plone docker - 5.1.0-alpine
- plone docker - 5.1.1-alpine
