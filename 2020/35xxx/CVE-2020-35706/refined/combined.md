[Flarepoint-CRM becomes DaybydayCRM](/Bottelet/DaybydayCRM/releases/tag/2.0.0)

For detailed information go to:

[https://medium.com/@casperbottelet/daybydaycrm-becomes-open-source-d40a4041ce6c](https://medium.com/%40casperbottelet/daybydaycrm-becomes-open-source-d40a4041ce6c)

1. Introduced a horizontal calendar for users to see appointments they have and other users have, with the ability to link to a lead, task, or project.
2. Absence tracking, the ability for users with the “HR permission” to see users’ absence and add absence for given user, all users can add absence on their profile, absences are reflected in the calendar, so it’s easy to get an overview
3. A lead will start by being unqualified and can now be converted to a qualified lead, to an order/invoice, or be directly closed in the new sidebar view, for unqualified leads which have been re-written to VueJs.
4. Information and activity sidebar has been added for Tasks, Projects and leads, to easily get an overview of the necessary information, and the flow of a given source.
5. Added the option to attach files to tasks, clients, and projects, which can be everything from contracts on the customers to wireframes on a given project.
6. Overall a lot of design changes, new colors, and better flow through different screens.
7. Added a topbar, to easily access user’s settings, the possibility to register absence, see the notification, actions, etc.
8. Made Status Polymorphic, so down the road, it’s possible to add your status from the UI for the different sources such as tasks.8.
9. Made more settings, able to set Company name, country, vat percentage, and open business hours.
10. Set a starting Invoice number, and the customer number the default is 10000 and will increment for each created invoice, and customer.
11. It’s now possible to set Currency and vat percentage.
12. Made invoices more a bit more complex with calculating taxes, adding the currency for the given country.
13. The first time logging in the user will be prompted to give some basic information from step 9.
14. Global search, users can activate or deactivate Elasticsearch in config/services if Elasticsearch is disabled(default) it will user query search.
15. Projects have been introduced as a project is a wrapper for many tasks, and give you the options to move tasks around in their different status on a scrum like board.
16. Generally, a lot of refactoring of the code, some for better some for worse, add some more tests.

[anyData and myData method Cleanup](/Bottelet/DaybydayCRM/releases/tag/1.3.7)

This update standardizes the way anyData and myData methods are written for Clients, Contacts, Leads and Tasks. It is not necessary for existing users to upgrade to this version.

This update also adds the application version to the page title once the user has logged in successfully.

If you're tracking the master branch using git, issue the following command to update from 1.2 or newer:

```
git checkout 1.3.7

```

No database changes if you're upgrading from 1.2 or newer. If you're upgrading from a version earlier than 1.2, you're strongly encouraged to backup your database and read the release notes for the the newer versions you'll be upgrading through/to. We strongly recommend stepping through each release to make sure you're completing all the upgrade requirements.

[Simplified Dummy Database Seeder](/Bottelet/DaybydayCRM/releases/tag/1.3.6)

This update adds a DummyDatabaseSeeder class which makes it easier for admins installing Flarepoint to quickly seed the database with dummy data. *It is not necessary for existing users to upgrade to this version.*

If you're tracking the master branch using git, issue the following command to update from 1.2 or newer:

```
git checkout 1.3.6

```

The wiki page for [Insertion of Dummy Data](https://github.com/Bottelet/Flarepoint-crm/wiki/Insertion-of-dummy-data) has also been updated to reflect this change.

No database changes if you're upgrading from 1.2 or newer. If you're upgrading from a version earlier than 1.2, you're strongly encouraged to backup your database and read the release notes for the the newer versions you'll be upgrading through/to. We strongly recommend stepping through each release to make sure you're completing all the upgrade requirements.
