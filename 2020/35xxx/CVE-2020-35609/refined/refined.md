- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An infinite loop in the Pluton ring buffer code, triggered by a continuous stream of asynchronous `/dev/pluton` ioctl requests. This fills the M4 to A7 ring buffer, causing the `/dev/pluton` kernel driver to get stuck when trying to find a new empty buffer, eventually leading to a device reboot via a hardware watchdog reset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled resource consumption due to the lack of proper handling of asynchronous ioctl requests, leading to the ring buffer exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service, causing the device to reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a continuous stream of asynchronous ioctl requests to the `/dev/pluton` device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the device and send ioctl requests to the `/dev/pluton` driver. Any user on the system can access this driver.
