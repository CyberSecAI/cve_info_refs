- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing token check in the `emailexport` feature of the `com_privacy` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially trigger the email export function without the user's consent, possibly leading to unintended data exposure or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted web page that sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a user logged into the affected Joomla instance. The attacker also needs to be able to induce a user to make the malicious request.
