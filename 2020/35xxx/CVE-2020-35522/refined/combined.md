# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202104-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibTIFF, the worst of
which could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.0** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag
Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and
KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LibTIFF. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing the user to process a specially crafted
TIFF file, could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LibTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.2.0"

```
