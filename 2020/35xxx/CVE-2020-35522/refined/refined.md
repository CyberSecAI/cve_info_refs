Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-35522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a memory allocation failure in the `tiff2rgba` function within the LibTIFF library, specifically in `tif_read.c`. This can occur when processing a crafted TIFF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Allocation Failure:** The core issue is that the library fails to properly allocate memory when handling a maliciously crafted TIFF file. This leads to an abort.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a program abort, resulting in a denial of service. The affected application will terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted TIFF image file. A user needs to be enticed to open/process this malicious file with a vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted TIFF File:** The attacker needs to be able to create a TIFF file that triggers the memory allocation failure in the vulnerable LibTIFF function.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must rely on the user to process the malicious TIFF file (e.g., open it with an application using the vulnerable libtiff library).
*   **Local/Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered locally or remotely, since the user could be opening a file from the local file system or over the network via the web.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Products:** NetApp ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility is listed as an affected product.
*   **Unaffected products:** A large number of NetApp products are explicitly listed as unaffected.
*   **Fix:** The fix for the vulnerability is included in libtiff version 4.2.0 and later, and corresponding package updates are available from vendors like NetApp and Red Hat.
*   **Red Hat:**  Red Hat's Bugzilla entry also mentions that the vulnerability is related to a memory allocation failure in `tif_pixarlog.c`.  Red Hat also lists this as a denial-of-service vulnerability, triggered by a crafted TIFF file that can lead to an abort.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo's advisory also notes that the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. However, this specific CVE is only listed as DoS for other sources.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-35522 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in LibTIFF due to a memory allocation failure when processing a specially crafted TIFF file. An attacker could exploit this by enticing a user to process a malicious TIFF file, leading to an application abort. The vulnerability is addressed in LibTIFF 4.2.0 and later versions.
