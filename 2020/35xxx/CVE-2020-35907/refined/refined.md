Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `UnsafeCell` in thread-local storage within the `futures-task` crate's `noop_waker_ref` function. This function was intended to return a no-op waker reference, and it incorrectly assumed that the reference would never be accessed from another thread.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Thread-Local Storage Usage:** The use of thread-local storage to store and return a reference to a waker is unsafe if the reference can outlive the thread.
- **Unsafe Dereference:** When `Waker::wake_by_ref()` is called on a waker obtained from another thread, the code attempts to dereference a pointer that is not accessible from the current (main) thread, leading to a segmentation fault.
- **Incorrect Assumptions about Waker Usage:** The code made the flawed assumption that the no-op waker would never be used in a different thread from which it was created.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a segmentation fault (segfault) and a crash of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multi-threading:** The attack vector involves creating a waker in one thread and then attempting to use it to invoke `wake_by_ref()` from another thread.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to execute code in a multi-threaded environment.
- No special privileges are needed (low privileges required).
- No user interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Function:** `futures_task::noop_waker_ref`
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of the `futures-task` crate prior to 0.3.5 are affected.
- **Patched Version:** The issue is resolved in version 0.3.5 and later.
- **Fix:** The fix involves replacing the thread-local storage with a `OnceCell::Lazy<>` wrapper around the no-op waker.
- **CVSS Score:** 5.5 (Moderate)
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a thread:
```rust
use futures_task::noop_waker_ref;
fn main() {
    let waker = std::thread::spawn(|| noop_waker_ref()).join().unwrap();
    waker.wake_by_ref();
}
```
This issue highlights the dangers of using thread-local storage with references that can outlive the thread and the importance of using thread-safe mechanisms when dealing with shared mutable state across threads.
