## Package

cargo

([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.3.5

## Patched versions

0.3.5

## Description

Affected versions of the crate used a UnsafeCell in thread-local storage to return a noop waker reference, assuming that the reference would never be returned from another thread.

This resulted in a segmentation fault crash if Waker::wake\_by\_ref() was called on a waker returned from another thread due to it attempting to dereference a pointer that wasn't accessible from the main thread.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

Affected versions of the crate used a `UnsafeCell` in thread-local storage to return a noop waker reference,
assuming that the reference would never be returned from another thread.

This resulted in a segmentation fault crash if `Waker::wake_by_ref()` was called on a waker returned from another thread due to
it attempting to dereference a pointer that wasn't accessible from the main thread.

Reproduction Example (from issue):

```
use futures_task::noop_waker_ref;
fn main() {
    let waker = std::thread::spawn(|| noop_waker_ref()).join().unwrap();
    waker.wake_by_ref();
}

```

The flaw was corrected by using a `OnceCell::Lazy<>` wrapper around the noop waker instead of thread-local storage.

## Description

![@goffrie](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1240398?u=0c1ad75b2598614f10612e2f1880b975f10d9b11&v=4&size=48)[goffrie](https://github.com/goffrie)opened [on Mar 3, 2020](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2091#issue-574997980)

[Demo](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=54ee9d6853898ff55932faa419efbbf2) which segfaults in playground:

```
use futures::task::noop_waker_ref;
fn main() {
    let waker = std::thread::spawn(|| noop_waker_ref()).join().unwrap();
    waker.wake_by_ref();
}
```

`noop_waker_ref()` returns a `'static` reference into TLS, but `Waker` is `Sync` so `&'static Waker` is `Send`, allowing the reference to outlive the thread it came from.

It should use something more like a lazy\_static.
