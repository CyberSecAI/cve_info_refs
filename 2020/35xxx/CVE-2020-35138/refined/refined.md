Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-35138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded encryption key within the MobileIron Mobile@Work agent application. This key is used to encrypt sensitive data, specifically the username, password, and PIN, before it's transmitted to the MobileIron server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The primary vulnerability is that the encryption key is hardcoded into the Mobile@Work agent. This allows an attacker to extract this key via reverse engineering of the application.
-   **Insecure Encryption:** Although the data is encrypted, the use of a static, hardcoded key makes the encryption ineffective as a security measure once the key is compromised.
-   **Lack of TLS Certificate Validation:** The Mobile@Work client does not validate the TLS certificate chain by default, relying instead on the mobile device's trust store. This makes man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks easier, although it's noted that enabling mutual certificate authentication will enable TLS validation.
-   **No Account Lockout Protection:** The MobileIron endpoint does not implement proper account lockout protection for authentication attempts. Lockouts are local to MobileIron and have a short duration (30 seconds). This allows for brute-force and user enumeration attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Credential Theft:** With the hardcoded encryption key, an attacker can decrypt captured MobileIron traffic, potentially revealing user credentials if a man-in-the-middle attack is performed, or construct their own valid authentication requests.
-   **Account Compromise:** By bypassing the client application and directly constructing requests, attackers can perform single-factor authentication attacks against user accounts. If successful they can gain access to internal corporate resources, VPN and employee emails by registering an attacker controlled mobile device.
-   **User Enumeration:** The lack of account lockout combined with different responses for valid, disabled/locked, and invalid user accounts allows attackers to enumerate valid user accounts.
-   **Brute-Force PIN Attacks:** Single-use PIN codes are vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to a lack of rate limiting.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Reverse Engineering:** The hardcoded key is extracted from the Mobile@Work agent application (APK/IPA) via reverse engineering.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attackers can perform MitM attacks by injecting a malicious TLS certificate if the device is compromised or a user can be coerced into installing a malicious certificate.
-   **Direct API Access:** The attacker can directly construct and submit authentication requests to the MobileIron server, bypassing the Mobile@Work client entirely.
-   **Network Attacks:** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the Mobile@Work client and the MobileIron server to capture encrypted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Technical Expertise:** Requires the ability to perform static analysis of mobile applications, understand networking protocols, and potentially perform MitM attacks.
-   **Access to Mobile@Work Agent:** Requires the ability to obtain and decompile/decrypt the Mobile@Work agent (APK or IPA).
-   **Network Access:** Network access to the MobileIron authentication endpoint is required, either directly over the internet, or via a compromised network position for MitM.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability can be exploited using the `rustyIron` tool, which was created by the researchers to test MobileIron security issues.
-   MobileIron acknowledges the issue but states that the risk is reduced by the use of TLS and other security measures. They also suggest configuration changes like enabling mutual certificate authentication, but this doesn't address the main vulnerability.
-  MobileIron also suggests using PIN-based authentication which can help mitigate user enumeration; however the PIN values are also vulnerable to brute-force attacks
-   The provided content provides a detailed technical analysis of the MobileIron protocol and the encryption process.
-   Ivanti disputes the severity of the vulnerabilities, arguing that the identified issues are applicable to any software and cloud vendor, and that the server was likely not hardened properly when tested by Optiv. They also state that password and PIN lockout settings can be configured in the MobileIron core.

**In summary, CVE-2020-35138 is due to the insecure storage of a static encryption key in the MobileIron client that allows an attacker to bypass some authentication and security measures to potentially compromise user accounts on the MobileIron platform.**
