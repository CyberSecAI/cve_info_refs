Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of malformed HTTP request headers by Tenda N300/N301 routers. The specific nature of the malformation is not detailed in this content but is described in the linked article.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By sending a specially crafted, malformed HTTP request header, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism of the router.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control of the affected router. This is indicated by the CVSS score of 9.6 and the high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Network access**: An attacker must be able to communicate with the device over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:** The attacker must have a network presence on the same network segment as the targeted router.
*   **No Privileges Required:** No user privileges are required (PR:N)
*   **No user interaction**: No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability (UI:N)

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Tenda N300/N301 routers and potentially other rebranded products.
*   The provided content includes a link to an external article with more technical details about the vulnerability which is titled "Tenda Malformed HTTP Request Header Processing Vulnerability"
*  The vulnerability disclosure timeline is listed, including dates of disclosure to US-CERT, Tenda, and public publication

The provided information aligns with the typical description of an authentication bypass vulnerability where a malformed input to a server allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
