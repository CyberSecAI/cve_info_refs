  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-35495",
      "description": "The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `bfd_pef_parse_symbols` function within `bfd/pef.c` of GNU Binutils. A crafted input file processed by objdump can trigger this vulnerability.",
      "root_cause": "The `bfd_pef_parse_symbols` function allocates memory using `bfd_malloc`, but doesn't check if the allocation was successful (resulting in a NULL pointer) before attempting to dereference the pointer and write to it via `bfd_bread`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Lack of proper error handling (specifically, failing to check return values of memory allocation functions)"
       ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to program crash.",
      "attack_vector": "Processing a crafted Portable Executable Format (PEF) file with objdump",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PEF file to be processed by vulnerable tools (e.g., objdump).",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in GNU Binutils versions before 2.34. The fix involves checking the return value of `bfd_malloc` before dereferencing the pointer."
