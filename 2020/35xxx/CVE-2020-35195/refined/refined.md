Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of a blank password for the root user within the `/etc/shadow` file in official `haproxy` Docker images prior to version 1.8.18-alpine. This configuration allows for unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Empty Root Password:** The most critical vulnerability is the lack of a password for the root user in the Docker image's configuration.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default configuration of the affected Docker images contains a critical security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operation of services using the vulnerable container.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain root access from a remote location.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Haproxy Docker Image:** The vulnerability exists within the official haproxy Docker images which are publicly available.
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability allows for remote exploitation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the machine running the vulnerable `haproxy` Docker container.
*   **No Credentials Required:** Because the root password is blank, the attacker does not need to know a valid password to gain root access.

**Affected Versions:**

The following versions of the `haproxy` Docker images are affected:

*   All alpine specific docker images prior to `1.8.18-alpine`.
*   Specific versions listed are: `1.8.17-alpine`, `1.9.3-alpine`, `1.9.2-alpine`, `1.9.1-alpine`, `1.8.16-alpine`, `1.8.15-alpine`, `1.9.0-alpine`, `rc-alpine`, `1.9-rc-alpine`, `1.9-dev11-alpine`, `1.9-dev10-alpine`, `1.8.14-alpine`, `1.9-dev9-alpine`, `1.8.13-alpine`, `1.8.12-alpine`, `1.5.16-alpine`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the alpine based docker images.
*   The fix would be to ensure a strong password is set for root, or use a mechanism like SSH keys, and is available in version `1.8.18-alpine` and later.
