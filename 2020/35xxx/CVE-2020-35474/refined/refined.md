Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35474:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `Html::rawElement` in combination with `Message::text` when constructing the "recentchanges-legend-watchlistexpiry" message within the MediaWiki software.  `Html::rawElement` does not perform sanitization of user-provided text, and `Message::text` doesn't escape HTML entities. This combination allows for the inclusion of raw HTML within the message, which is then rendered by the browser without sanitization leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The primary weakness is the possibility of injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the `recentchanges-legend-watchlistexpiry` message, which can then be executed by a user's browser viewing the Recent Changes page or other similar pages where the message is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable message. This JavaScript could be used to:
    *   Steal user session cookies, allowing for account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the page, potentially defacing the wiki.
    *   Perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Other HTML-based attacks**: Besides javascript injection, any HTML code could be injected, which may lead to phishing, defacement, or other types of attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the  `recentchanges-legend-watchlistexpiry` message. An attacker could potentially achieve this through:

1.  **Modifying the message:** An attacker with sufficient privileges to edit system messages could directly insert malicious HTML into the `recentchanges-legend-watchlistexpiry` message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs:

*   **Privileges to edit MediaWiki system messages:** In a standard MediaWiki installation, this typically involves having administrator or similar elevated privileges.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable message:** The attacker needs to be aware that the `recentchanges-legend-watchlistexpiry` message is vulnerable to raw HTML injection.

**Additional Details from Content**

*   The vulnerability exists in MediaWiki versions 1.35 and later. It has been backported to 1.31, but not earlier versions.
*   The fix was to replace `Html::rawElement` with `Html::element` which escapes HTML entities, or `Message::parse/Message::escaped` which parse and escape the message.
*   The message was introduced with the  `$wgWatchlistExpiry` feature flag.
*   The vulnerability was reported by a user named "Umherirrender".
*   The fix was implemented in a series of Gerrit commits:
    *   [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/649517](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/649517) (REL1\_35)
