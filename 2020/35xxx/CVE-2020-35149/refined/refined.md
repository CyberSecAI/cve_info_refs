The provided content relates to a fix for a potential prototype pollution vulnerability in the `mquery` library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cloneObject` and `merge` functions in `lib/utils.js` were vulnerable to prototype pollution. These functions iterated through the properties of an object and copied them to a new object, or merged them into an existing object, respectively.  However, they did not check for special properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`, which can be used to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Prototype pollution vulnerability in `cloneObject` and `merge` functions. The vulnerability stems from the functions' failure to sanitize object keys, allowing an attacker to inject malicious properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`, leading to potential modification of the Object.prototype.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially pollute the prototype of all objects in the application's environment. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other malicious behavior depending on the application's usage of the polluted prototype.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious object containing special properties like `__proto__`, then pass it to `cloneObject` or `merge` functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to control the input object passed to the vulnerable `cloneObject` or `merge` functions. This could be achieved through various vectors depending on the application's usage of the library and data flow.

The fix implemented in the commit adds a check to specifically avoid copying these special properties during cloning or merging, effectively preventing the prototype pollution attack.
