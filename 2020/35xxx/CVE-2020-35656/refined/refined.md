Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is an Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability present in JAWS CMS versions 1.8.0 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness lies in the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, which allows an authenticated user to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or service disruption.
- The provided example shows that the attacker can execute system commands (e.g., `whoami`).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the JAWS CMS.
- It requires an authenticated user to be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the JAWS CMS (e.g., administrator access).
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where JAWS CMS is running.

**Additional Details:**
- A python script `jaws-rce.py` is provided which automates the exploitation process by:
   - Authenticating to the target system with provided credentials.
   - Uploading a malicious PHP file named `cmd.php` which allows execution of system commands.
   - Triggering the execution of the uploaded PHP file with a command parameter which leads to RCE.
- The provided example demonstrates the shell location where the malicious code is executed.
- The exploit targets JAWS CMS <= 1.8.0.
