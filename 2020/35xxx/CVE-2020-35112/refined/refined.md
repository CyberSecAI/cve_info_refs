  "cveId": "CVE-2020-35112",
  "description": "If a user downloaded a file lacking an extension on Windows, and then \"Open\"-ed it from the downloads panel, if there was an executable file in the downloads directory with the same name but with an executable extension (such as .bat or .exe) that executable would have been launched instead. Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the Windows operating system when a user attempts to open a file without an extension and there is another file in the same directory with the same name but with an executable extension (e.g., .exe, .bat, .com). In this situation, Windows gives preference to the executable file and launches it instead of the intended file without extension.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The lack of proper handling of extensionless files in the download panel's \"Open\" functionality",
      "The operating system's default behavior of prioritizing executable files when opening a file without an extension."
    ],
    "impact": "If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to an arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. When the user attempts to open a downloaded file with no extension, a same-named malicious executable in the same directory could be launched instead of the intended downloaded file. This allows the attacker to run malicious code on the user's machine, such as installing malware or taking control over the system.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The user is tricked into downloading a file without an extension.",
       "The attacker crafts a malicious executable with the same name as the downloaded file and puts it in the download directory.",
       "The user then clicks \"Open\" in the download panel, thus launching the malicious executable instead of the downloaded file without the extension."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
       "The attacker must be able to lure the user into downloading a file without an extension.",
       "The attacker needs to have the ability to put a malicious executable with the same base name and a recognized extension in the user's download directory."
