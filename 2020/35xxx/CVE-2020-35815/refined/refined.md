The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified by PSV-2018-0488, affecting multiple router and WiFi system models. This advisory does not have any associated CVE IDs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored XSS vulnerability present in the web-based management interface of the affected NETGEAR devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This means that malicious script code can be injected into the device's configuration, which is then executed when another user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to:
* Session hijacking
* Defacement of web pages
* Information disclosure

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious script code into the web management interface of the affected NETGEAR devices. The specific input method is not specified in this advisory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the web management interface and to be able to inject the malicious script. The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs High privileges on a adjacent network (AV:A, AC:L, PR:H). No user interaction is required.

**Affected Products:**
The following NETGEAR product models are affected:
* D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
