- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Data Exchange Management Studio does not sanitize input to an HTML document field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Compromise of the Data Exchange Management Studio UI or the internal database, potentially leading to non-functional Manager software.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the unsanitized HTML document field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileged access (PR:L) to insert a payload into the unsanitized HTML field.
