The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory states a "stored cross site scripting security vulnerability". This means that user-provided input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the device, which can later be executed in the browsers of other users, or the same user, when visiting affected pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This is the core vulnerability. Malicious scripts can be injected into the device's configuration or data storage, and these scripts are executed when the affected web pages are rendered by the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to various issues, including:
  - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies and gaining unauthorized access to the routerâ€™s configuration interface.
  - Defacement: Altering the appearance of the web interface.
  - Phishing: Redirecting users to malicious sites for credential harvesting.
  - Data theft: Extracting sensitive information stored on the router.
  - Other malicious activities: Performing actions on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into input fields or other areas that store user-provided data. The specific vector is not described in detail, but it could involve configuration settings, device naming, or other input fields.
- The stored script executes when a user visits the affected web page of the device's management interface

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to an interface where data can be stored on the device. This would likely require authenticated access to the device's web interface. The CVSS vector indicates a 'High' privilege requirement (PR:H), confirming the attacker needs administrative access.

**Affected products and firmware versions:**
The advisory lists the following products and vulnerable firmware versions:
*   D7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
*   R7500v2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
*   R7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.68
*   RAX120, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78
*   RBK22, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
*   RBR20, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
*   RBS20, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
*   RBK40, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBR40, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBS40, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBK50, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBR50, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBS50, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   WN3000RPv2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory is identified as "PSV-2018-0539".
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.0, rated as Medium severity. The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`
- It is recommended to update to the latest firmware versions to patch the vulnerability.

This advisory provides useful information about the vulnerability, including its nature, impact, and affected products and versions.
