Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-35681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the legacy `channels.http.AsgiHandler` class in Channels, which was used for handling HTTP requests in ASGI environments prior to Django 3.0. This handler failed to properly isolate request scopes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Scope Separation:** The primary issue was that `AsgiHandler` did not correctly separate request scopes. This means that data meant for one client could potentially be associated with a different client's request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Session Identifier Leakage:**  With precise timing, the vulnerability could lead to responses being sent to the wrong client. This could result in the leakage of sensitive data, including session identifiers. Other sensitive data might also be exposed.
- **Data Exposure:** The broader impact is the potential exposure of any kind of sensitive data contained within the request/response cycle.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Timing-Sensitive:** The exploitability of this issue is dependent on specific timing of the requests. Attackers would need to craft requests that expose the incorrect scope handling by `AsgiHandler`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge of the issue and how `AsgiHandler` handles requests.
- **Precise Timing:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting requests and sending them with precise timing to exploit the flawed scope separation.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Channels versions 3.0.x before 3.0.3 and only affects the legacy `AsgiHandler`. It does not affect Django's `ASGIHandler` which is available from Django 3.0+.
- The issue is triggered either when the handler for the `'http'` key is not explicitly set in `ProtocolTypeRouter`, or when `channels.http.AsgiHandler` is explicitly used. These scenarios are typically used to support Django v2.2.
- Using `channels.http.AsgiHandler` is deprecated from Channels v3.0.0.

**Mitigation:**

- Update to Channels 3.0.3 or later.
- Migrate to Django 3.0+ and utilize Django's `ASGIHandler`.
- Ensure that the `'http'` key in `ProtocolTypeRouter` is explicitly set to use a correct handler (e.g. `django_asgi_app` or Django's `ASGIHandler`).
