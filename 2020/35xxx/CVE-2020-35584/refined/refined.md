Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Mersive Solstice Pod web application uses unencrypted HTTP protocol for communication, specifically for configuration and the "Browser Look-in" feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Encryption:** The primary weakness is the use of HTTP instead of HTTPS, which means all communications are transmitted in plaintext.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability**: Because of the unencrypted communication, an attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic can eavesdrop on the communication between a user and the Solstice Pod.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can intercept sensitive information such as:
  - Administrator passwords (transmitted as SHA1 hash, but still vulnerable).
  - Screen keys used to connect to the Solstice Pod.
  - Any other information transmitted during user interaction with the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** The attack vector involves an attacker positioned on the network who can intercept the traffic between a legitimate user and the Solstice Pod. This could include an attacker on the same WiFi network or an attacker with access to network infrastructure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to monitor network traffic, which means they need to be on the same network segment as the victim or have access to network infrastructure.
- **Passive Eavesdropping:** The attacker doesn't need to interact with the system directly; they can passively intercept data as it is transmitted.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of Mersive Solstice Pods running firmware prior to **3.0.3 (August 2017)**.
- Later firmware versions may also be vulnerable.
- The web application is used for both configuration and the "Browser Look-in" feature, increasing the surface area for potential exploitation.
- The captured data includes the screen key and the admin password (which is hashed, but still vulnerable).
