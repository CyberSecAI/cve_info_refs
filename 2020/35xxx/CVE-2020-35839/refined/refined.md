The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0513, affecting multiple router models. While the advisory does not directly reference a CVE ID, it describes a vulnerability with characteristics that align with common XSS scenarios.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the firmware of the affected Netgear router models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored on the router, which are then executed when other users interact with the affected part of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact could be significant as a successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts within a user's browser. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacement of the router management interface
  - Further compromise of the router and potentially the network.
  - Other malicious actions at the victimâ€™s browser

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into the router's web interface through some unspecified mechanism. Once injected, these scripts are stored on the router and executed when a user interacts with the relevant area of the interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to inject malicious script, which likely requires either network access to the router's management interface, or access to a system that can trigger the vulnerability if exposed via the internet/other channels. The advisory indicates that this is a medium severity vulnerability. The CVSS vector indicates a need for "adjacent" network access and "high" privileges for exploitation.
