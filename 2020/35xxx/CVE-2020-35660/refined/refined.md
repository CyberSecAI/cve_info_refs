Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the context of CVE-2020-35660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the journal entry feature of the Monica application. Specifically, it stemmed from the use of PHP's Parsedown library to process Markdown, which was not properly sanitizing user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Malicious JavaScript code could be injected into a journal entry through specially crafted markdown.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application was not properly sanitizing user-provided markdown content before rendering it in the user interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the browsers of other users viewing the affected journal entries.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** This could lead to stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, potentially resulting in account compromise or further attacks on the application.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could alter the visual appearance of the application for other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Journal Entry Creation:** An attacker would create a journal entry with crafted Markdown containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Viewing Affected Journal Entries:** When other users view the attacker's malicious journal entry, the JavaScript payload is executed within their browser session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker would need to be an authenticated user capable of creating journal entries.
- **No Special Network Access Required:** The attack is client-side, exploiting the lack of sanitization in the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved removing the use of PHP's `Parsedown` library and instead using the JavaScript `marked` library for markdown parsing. This indicates the `marked` library is used to properly sanitize the markdown input.
- This vulnerability was reported on huntr.dev and the fix was tracked in pull request #4451. The vulnerability was also referenced in other related pull requests and issues, highlighting that it was a known security concern.
- The fix was included in release v2.19.1.
