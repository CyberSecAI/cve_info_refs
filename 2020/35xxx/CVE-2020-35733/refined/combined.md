               Fixed usage of AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS() macros in configure
               script sources.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- crypto-4.8.2 ----------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The crypto-4.8.2 application can be applied independently of other
 applications on a full OTP 23 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17093    Application(s): crypto, megaco, odbc, otp, snmp
               Related Id(s): ERL-1447, PR-2948

               Fixed usage of AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS() macros in configure
               script sources.

 Full runtime dependencies of crypto-4.8.2: erts-9.0, kernel-5.3,

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- erl_interface-4.0.2 ---------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The erl_interface-4.0.2 application can be applied independently of
 other applications on a full OTP 23 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17099    Application(s): erl_interface
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-585

               Integers outside of the range [-(1 bsl 32) - 1, (1 bsl
               32) -1] were previously intended to be printed in an
               internal bignum format by ei_print_term() and
               ei_s_print_term(). Unfortunately the implementation has
               been buggy since OTP R13B02 and since then produced
               results with random content which also could crash the
               calling program.

               This fix replaces the printing of the internal format
               with printing in hexadecimal form and extend the range
               for printing in decimal form. Currently integers in the
               range [-(1 bsl 64), (1 bsl 64)] are printed in decimal
               form and integers outside of this range in Erlang
               hexadecimal form.

 --- Known Bugs and Problems ---

  OTP-16607    Application(s): erl_interface
               Related Id(s): OTP-16608

               The ei API for decoding/encoding terms is not fully
               64-bit compatible since terms that have a
               representation on the external term format larger than
               2 GB cannot be handled.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- erts-11.1.6 -----------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The erts-11.1.6 application can be applied independently of other
 applications on a full OTP 23 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17080    Application(s): erts

               The suspend_process() and resume_process() BIFs did not
               check their arguments properly which could cause an
               emulator crash.

  OTP-17088    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-580

               The runtime system would get into an infinite loop if
               the runtime system was started with more than 1023 file
               descriptors already open.

 Full runtime dependencies of erts-11.1.6: kernel-7.0, sasl-3.3,
 stdlib-3.13

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- megaco-3.19.5 ---------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

               Related Id(s): ERL-1447, PR-2948

               Fixed usage of AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS() macros in configure
               script sources.

 Full runtime dependencies of megaco-3.19.5: asn1-3.0, debugger-4.0,
 erts-7.0, et-1.5, kernel-3.0, runtime_tools-1.8.14, stdlib-2.5

               Related Id(s): ERL-1447, PR-2948

               Fixed usage of AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS() macros in configure
               script sources.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- ssl-10.2.1 ------------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ssl-10.2.1 application can be applied independently of other
 applications on a full OTP 23 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17098    Application(s): ssl

               Fix CVE-2020-35733 this only affects ssl-10.2
               (OTP-23.2). This vulnerability could enable a man in
               the middle attack using a fake chain to a known trusted
               ROOT. Also limits alternative chain handling, for
               handling of possibly extraneous certs, to improve
               memory management.

 --- Improvements and New Features ---

  OTP-17100    Application(s): ssl

               Add support for AES CCM based cipher suites defined in
               RFC 7251

               Also Correct cipher suite name conversion to OpenSSL
               names. A few names where corrected earlier in OTP-16267
               For backwards compatible reasons we support usage of
               openSSL names for cipher suites. Mostly anonymous
               suites names where incorrect, but also some legacy
               suites.

 Full runtime dependencies of ssl-10.2.1: crypto-4.2, erts-10.0,
 inets-5.10.7, kernel-6.0, public_key-1.8, stdlib-3.12

### Download Erlang/OTP

The latest version of Erlang/OTP is [27.2](/patches/OTP-27.2). To install Erlang you can either build it [from source](#source) or use a [pre-built package](#prebuilt).

Take a look at the [Erlang/OTP 27 release description](/downloads/27) to see what changes Erlang/OTP 27 brings over the previous major version.

The Erlang/OTP version scheme is described in the [Erlang/OTP Systems Principles Guide](/doc/system/versions#version-scheme).

### Compiling Erlang from source [#](#source)

You can build Erlang from source on your own, following the [building and installation instructions](/doc/system/install). In a nutshell to install a pre-built archive you need only do:

```
./configure && make && make install

```

If you clone the release from git, there may be some additional steps needed depending on which version of Erlang/OTP you are compiling. So always make sure to read the build and install instruction of the release you are compiling.

You can also use third-party tools such as [Kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl), [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang) or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/erlang.html) to compile Erlang. They help to remove the differences between Erlang/OTP releases and the OS you are compiling on.

### Pre-built Binary Packages [#](#prebuilt)

Most OS package managers provide pre-built binary packages.

* For Homebrew on macOS: `brew install erlang`
* For MacPorts on macOS: `port install erlang`
* For Ubuntu and Debian: `apt-get install erlang`
* For Fedora: `dnf install erlang`
* For ArchLinux and Manjaro: `pacman -S erlang`
* For FreeBSD: `pkg install erlang`

The OS provided packages tend to not contain the latest version of Erlang/OTP.
So [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/) provides up to date pre-built packages for the latest stable releases. Erlang Solutions provides pre-built binary packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS and other operating systems.

### License

Since Erlang/OTP 18.0, Erlang/OTP is released under [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The older releases prior to Erlang/OTP 18.0 were released under [Erlang Public License (EPL)](/EPLICENSE), a derivative work of the Mozilla Public License (MPL).

## OTP 27.2

Erlang/OTP 27.2 is the second maintenance patch package for OTP 27, with mostly bug fixes as well as improvements.

### Potential incompatibilities:

* The HTTP client now correctly takes into account the `full_result` request option

  when returning an asynchronous request.

For details about bugfixes and potential incompatibilities see the [Erlang 27.2 README](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-27.2.README)

The Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository, <https://github.com/erlang/otp>

Download links for this and previous versions are found here

installation using the 'otp\_patch\_apply' tool. For information on install

requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# common\_test-1.27.4

The common\_test-1.27.4 application can be applied independently of other

applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* With this change, cth\_surefire hook module handles group path reduction for a

  skipped group. This fixes a bug manifesting with improper group path for a

  group executed after a group which was skipped.

# compiler-8.5.3

The compiler-8.5.3 application can be applied independently of other

applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* In rare circumstances, the destructive tuple update optimization could be

  applied when it was unsafe.

  Own Id: OTP-19340

  Related Id(s): [GH-9014](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/9014), [PR-9024](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9024)

# kernel-10.1.2

Note! The kernel-10.1.2 application *cannot* be applied independently of other

applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

```
   On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
   dependency has to be satisfied:
   -- erts-15.1 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

```
## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* On windows the socket:recv could return with success ({ok, Data}) even though

  not all data had been read.

# public\_key-1.16.4

The public\_key-1.16.4 application can be applied independently of other

applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* If both `ext-key-usage` and `key-usage` are defined for a certificate it

  should be checked that these usages are consistent with each other. This will

  have the affect that such certificates where the `ext-key-usages` is marked as

  critical and the usages is consistent with the `key-use` it can be considered

  valid without mandatory application specific checks for the `ext-key-useage`

  extension.

# ssl-11.2.5

Note! The ssl-11.2.5 application *cannot* be applied independently of other

applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

```
   On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
   dependency has to be satisfied:
   -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

```
## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Avoid generating an internal alert for case that should have been an orderly

  shutdown by the supervisor.

  Own Id: OTP-19311

  Related Id(s): [PR-8980](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8980)
* If present, extended key-usage TLS (SSL) role check (`pk-clientAuth`,

  `pk-serverAuth`) should always be performed for peer-cert. An intermediate CA

  cert may relax the requirement if `AnyExtendedKeyUsage` purpose is present.

  In OTP-25.3.2.8, OTP-26.2 and OTP-27.0 these requirements became too relaxed.

  There where two problems, firstly the peer cert extension was only checked if

  it was marked critical, and secondly the CA cert check did not assert the

  relaxed `AnyExtendedKeyUsage` purpose.

  This could result in that certificates might be misused for purposes not

  intended by the certificate authority.

  Thanks to Bryan Paxton for reporting the issue.

  Related Id(s): [PR-9130](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/9130), CVE-2024-53846, OTP-19240

## Improvements and New Features

* Back port certificate\_authorities option for TLS-1.3 servers to pre TLS-1.3

  servers to enable them to disable the sending of certificate authorities in

  their certificate request. This will have same affect as the the TLS-1.3

  server option although it is handled by a different mechanism in these

  versions, where the functionality is described to be more of a guidance,

  although some pre TLS clients have proven to make it mandatory as in TLS-1.3

  extension handling.

               If present, extended key-usage TLS (SSL) role check
               (pk-clientAuth, pk-serverAuth) should always be

               relax the requirement if AnyExtendedKeyUsage purpose is
               present.

               In OTP-25.3.2.8, OTP-26.2 and OTP-27.0 these
               requirements became too relaxed. There where two
               problems, firstly the peer cert extension was only
               checked if it was marked critical, and secondly the CA
               cert check did not assert the relaxed
               AnyExtendedKeyUsage purpose.

               This could result in that certificates might be misused
               for purposes not intended by the certificate authority.

# erts-15.1.2

The erts-15.1.2 application can be applied independently of other applications

on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* A bug has been fixed where receiving an SCTP message with `gen_sctp` could

  waste the first fragments of a message and only deliver the last fragment.

  This happened with low probability when the OS signaled that the socket was

  ready for reading in combination with an internal time-out retry.

  A bug has been fixed with a lingering time-out from after an SCTP connect that

  could stop the flow of incoming messages on an active `gen_tcp` socket.

  Own Id: OTP-19235

  Related Id(s): ERIERL-1133, [PR-8837](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8837)
* An boolean option `non_block_send` for SCTP, has ben added to be able to

  achieve the old behaviour to avoid blocking send operations by passing the OS

  network stack error message (`{error,eagain}` through.

  Own Id: OTP-19258

  Related Id(s): ERIERL-1134, OTP-19061
* The call `gen_tcp:send/2` could hang indefinitely despite having set the

  `send_timeout` option for the following unfortunate combination of

  circumstances:

  + The socket has to be in passive mode.
  + All output buffers had to be filled util the `high_watermark` was hit,

    causing the `gen_tcp:send/2` operation to block.
  + While the send operation was blocked, a `gen_tcp:recv/2,3` call had to be

    done from a different process. It had to block, waiting for data for a while

    before completing the operation, and the received packet had to fill at

    least 75% of the receive buffer.

  Under these circumstances he information that a send operation was waiting got

  lost, so the send operation that blocked in the first placed would never

  return. The data it had would be sent, though, and send operations from other

  processes, still work.

  This bug has been fixed.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Refactor trying to also make some optimizations introduced a bug in signature

  algorithms checks in OTP-26.2.1. This could manifest itself in not being able

  to negotiate connections using certificates needing to use some TLS-1.2

  compatibility legacy signature schemes.

               Do not hide crypto badarg reason, this error handling
               enhancement facilitates debugging. These kind of
               runtime errors are not documented and should never be

  OTP-19236    Application(s): ssl

               Starting from TLS-1.3 some server handshake alerts
               might arrive after ssl:connection/2,3,4 has returned.
               If the socket is in active mode the controlling process
               will get the alert message, but passive sockets would
               only get {error, closed} on next call to ssl:recv/2,3
               or ssl/setopts/2. Passive sockets calls will now return
               {error, error_alert()} instead.

  OTP-19257    Application(s): ssl
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-1131

               Servers configured to support only version (pre
               TLS-1.2) should ignore hello version extension, as it
               is an unknown extension to them, this will result in
               that new clients that do not support the old server
               version will get an insufficient security alert from
               the server and not a protocol version alert, this is
               consistent with how old servers not able to support
               higher protocol versions work.

  OTP-19274    Application(s): ssl
               Related Id(s): PR-8901

               Correct timeout handling for termination code run for
               own alerts, so that intended timeout is used instead of
               falling back to OS TCP-stack timeout that is
               unreasonably long on some platforms.

  OTP-19235    Application(s): erts, kernel
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-1133, PR-8837

               A bug has been fixed where receiving an SCTP message
               with `gen_sctp` could waste the first fragments of a
               message and only deliver the last fragment.

               This happened with low probability when the OS signaled
               that the socket was ready for reading in combination
               with an internal time-out retry.

               A bug has been fixed with a lingering time-out from
               after an SCTP connect that could stop the flow of
               incoming messages on an active `gen_tcp` socket.

  OTP-19251    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): GH-8853

               On Windows, successive failed socket calls caused
               socket to become "uninitialized".

  OTP-19254    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): GH-8848

               The socket framework fails to start on a IPv6-only
               Windows machine.

  OTP-19258    Application(s): erts, kernel
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-1134, OTP-19061

               An boolean option `non_block_send` for SCTP, has ben
               added to be able to achieve the old behaviour to avoid
               blocking send operations by passing the OS network
               stack error message (`{error,eagain}` through.

  OTP-19267    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-1138, GH-6455, PR-8892, OTP-18520

               The call `gen_tcp:send/2` could hang indefinitely
               despite having set the `send_timeout` option for the
               following unfortunate combination of circumstances:

               * The socket has to be in passive mode. * All output
               buffers had to be filled util the `high_watermark` was
               hit, causing the `gen_tcp:send/2` operation to block. *
               While the send operation was blocked, a
               `gen_tcp:recv/2,3` call had to be done from a different
               process. It had to block, waiting for data for a while
               before completing the operation, and the received
               packet had to fill at least 75% of the receive buffer.

               Under these circumstances he information that a send
               operation was waiting got lost, so the send operation
               that blocked in the first placed would never return.
               The data it had would be sent, though, and send
               operations from other processes, still work.

               This bug has been fixed.

  OTP-19269    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): GH-8835, PR-8897

               Fixed beam crash that could happen if resetting

Check out the git tag OTP-27.1.1, and build a full OTP system including

documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your

installation using the 'otp\_patch\_apply' tool. For information on install

requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# common\_test-1.27.2

The common\_test-1.27.2 application can be applied independently of other

applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* With this change, HTML reports include jQuery version 3.7.1.

  Own Id: OTP-19252

# erts-15.1.1

The erts-15.1.1 application can be applied independently of other applications

on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* On Windows, successive failed socket calls caused socket to become

  "uninitialized".

  Own Id: OTP-19251

  Related Id(s): [#8853](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/8853)
* The socket framework fails to start on a IPv6-only Windows machine.

> kernel-9.0, sasl-3.3, stdlib-4.1

# public\_key-1.16.3

The public\_key-1.16.3 application can be applied independently of other

applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Introduction of verify\_fun/4 unfortunately introduced an argument switch for

  some specific path validation errors so that verify\_fun/3 could under these

  circumstances be called with a DER cert instead of a decod cert, also in this

  situation the verify\_fun/4 would have the certificates in reverse order.

  Own Id: OTP-19245

  Related Id(s): [GH-8832](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/8832)

## Improvements and New Features

* Do not hide crypto badarg reason, this error handling enhancement facilitates

  debugging. These kind of runtime errors are not documented and should never be

  relied on for matching, they are intended for catching input errors early.

  Own Id: OTP-19238

> #### Full runtime dependencies of public\_key-1.16.3
>
> asn1-3.0, crypto-4.6, erts-6.0, kernel-3.0, stdlib-3.5

# ssl-11.2.3

Note! The ssl-11.2.3 application *cannot* be applied independently of other

applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

```
   On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
   dependency has to be satisfied:
   -- public_key-1.16.2 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

```
## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Starting from TLS-1.3 some server handshake alerts might arrive after

  ssl:connection/2,3,4 has returned. If the socket is in active mode the

  controlling process will get the alert message, but passive sockets would only

  get {error, closed} on next call to ssl:recv/2,3 or ssl/setopts/2. Passive

  sockets calls will now return {error, error\_alert()} instead.

  Own Id: OTP-19236

  Related Id(s): [PR-8261](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8261)
* Servers configured to support only version (pre TLS-1.2) should ignore hello

  version extension, as it is an unknown extension to them, this will result in

  that new clients that do not support the old server version will get an

  insufficient security alert from the server and not a protocol version alert,

  this is consistent with how old servers not able to support higher protocol

  versions work.

# stdlib-6.1.1

The stdlib-6.1.1 application can be applied independently of other applications

on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

* Remove whitespace stripping of returned binaries in `json:decode/3`.

  Own Id: OTP-19227

  Related Id(s): ERIERL-1130, [PR-8809](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8809)
* Fix `zip:unzip/2` to not crash when extracting zip files with garbage in the

  Zip64 extra header. This bug was introduced in Erlang 27.1 and has so far only

  been seen on some archives creates by MS Excel.

  Own Id: OTP-19241

  Related Id(s): [PR-8836](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/8836)
* With this change, shutdown procedure handles a race condition between

  supervisor executing a shutdown and child process termination from other

  reason.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- diameter-2.2.7.2 ------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The diameter-2.2.7.2 application can be applied independently of
 other applications on a full OTP 25 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-19206    Application(s): diameter
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-1102

               `diameter:stop_service/1` has been made more
               synchronous.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The public_key-1.13.3.3 application can be applied independently of
 other applications on a full OTP 25 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-19179    Application(s): public_key

               For completeness handle rsa_pss implicit default value,
               although this will probably not be commonly used as it
               provides very weak security.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-19170    Application(s): ssh
               Related Id(s): GH-7746

               The SSh daemon started with a TCP port number argument
               will now re-try obtaining a listen socket before
               returning an error to the user.

  OTP-19173    Application(s): ssh
               Related Id(s): PR-8310

               Robustness has been improved by monitoring the
               connection handler process before casting the socket
               control notification.

 Full runtime dependencies of ssh-4.15.3.6: crypto-5.0, erts-11.0,
 kernel-6.0, public_key-1.6.1, runtime_tools-1.15.1, stdlib-3.15

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-19217    Application(s): xmerl
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-1104

               Corrected export functions from internal structure to
               XML so xmlText items of type cdata are handled
               correctly. They were just exported as normal text
               instead of output in a CDATA section.
