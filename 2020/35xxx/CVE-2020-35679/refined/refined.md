Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing `regfree()` call after using `regcomp()` and `regexec()` when performing regex lookups within the table.c file of OpenSMTPD. This omission leads to a memory leak with each regex lookup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak caused by failure to free memory allocated for regex operations. The memory allocated by `regcomp` is not released using `regfree` after the regex operation is completed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:**  A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by repeatedly triggering regex lookups, which would consume server memory. The severity of the impact is described as "low" by Gentoo, but "medium" by Fedora. The impact depends on the configuration, size of tables used by regex and filters in place. The leak could grow from non existent to very significant.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can remotely connect to the SMTP listener daemon to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack vector involves sending specially crafted messages that cause the server to perform regex lookups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the OpenSMTPD service.
- The attacker must be able to send SMTP traffic that will result in regex lookups.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of OpenSMTPD prior to 6.8.0p2.
- The fix involves adding a `regfree(&preg)` after the `regexec` call in `table_regex_match` function in `table.c` file.
- This was not a easily discovered bug, requiring investigation into DNS lookups, filters and table lookups before it was pinpointed.
