The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in zzcms2020.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `content` parameter in `zzcms2020/user/manage.php` is directly inserted into the database without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability in the user profile management functionality.
- Lack of input sanitization or output encoding of user-controlled data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users viewing the affected profile page (`My exhibition hall`).
- This could lead to:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload using Javascript, and submits it through the `content` parameter in `zzcms2020/user/manage.php`.
- When another user views the `My exhibition hall` page, the malicious JavaScript code is executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have an account on the zzcms2020 instance with the ability to modify profile information.
- No special privileges required, access to the user profile modification functionality is sufficient.
