# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[0.23.0](/rusqlite/rusqlite/tree/0.23.0)

[`54043c8`](/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/54043c803c83517aa54b463b098a61dfa28c54f4)

The release primarily contains a number of security/memory safety fixes, which were mostly found due to an audit of the unsafe code in the crate. An advisory will be published for these shortly.

They mostly impact APIs exposed through `features`, so while there are a lot of them, if you're using rusqlite under default features, you're fine. None of them impact libsqlite3-sys.

It's a major release as these APIs were fundamentally unsound and could not be fixed without breaking changes.

* Make VTab / VTabCursor `unsafe trait` as implementing them on the wrong type is unsound [c9ef5bd](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/c9ef5bd63cad5c0c123344c072b490a1a9bcbe1f). (Note that a safe VTab API is planned in the future).
* Make `create_module` take a &'static Module as that's what the reference was treated as. [3c6b57f](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/3c6b57fe1b2cc87e7ebecde43dd836ffb1c4ea5c)
* Make `UnlockNotification` hold the Mutex while notifying the CondVar. Also, ensure `&mut` is not used to reference a value shared across another thread. [45fd77e](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/45fd77ee43c38eea4d6f4e2e56c1667a55ec654f)
* Fix potential format string vuln in rusqlite::trace::log [2327d3b](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/2327d3b774927fdf48903c0bdc1ca7ec93c7c8d0)
* Auxdata API has been changed and has new bounds.
  + Fix potential use-after-free and data race in auxdata api [2ef3628](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/2ef3628dac35aeba0a97d5fb3a57746b4e1d62b3)
  + Fix repr(Rust) type being used as if it were repr(C) [71b2f51](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/71b2f5187b0cbace3f8b6ff53432ff2ca0defcf0)
* Fix use-after-free in sessions.rs in [ac30e16](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/ac30e169ae51b262bc8cf7026469851ce39b23c6)

Non-safety changes in this release:

* Bundled SQLite has been updated to 3.31.1 [22564d3](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/22564d3099f7fab835347edf8b5d3eda1364014b)
* Non-unicode paths are now handled properly, at least on unix [#692](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/pull/692)
* Functions using va\_list are excluded from the bundled bindings, as these are platform specific. You can still use them if you enable the buildtime\_bindgen feature. [288aa96](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/commit/288aa961a75ac29f704bfe2f9794148e0a197e10)
* An unchecked\_transaction function has been added which allows opting-out of compile time transaction checking. Despite it's name, it's still checked, it just downgrades a compilation error to a runtime one: [#693](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/pull/693)
* std::error::Error::source is implemented in favor of std::error::Error::cause for all error types.
