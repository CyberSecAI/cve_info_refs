## Package

cargo

tokio-rustls
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.12.0, < 0.12.3
>= 0.13.0, < 0.13.1

## Patched versions

## Description

tokio-rustls does not call process\_new\_packets immediately after read, so the expected termination condition wants\_read always returns true. As long as new incoming data arrives faster than it is processed and the reader does not return pending, data will be buffered. This may cause DoS.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @quininer **[quininer](/quininer)** commented [May 19, 2020](#issue-620653263)

The `wants_read` only changes after `process_new_packets`,

which means that not immediately calling `process_new_packets` may cause rustls to cache too much data.

`tokio-rustls` does not call `process_new_packets` immediately after `read`,
so the expected termination condition `wants_read` always returns true.
As long as new incoming data arrives faster than it is processed
and the reader does not return pending, data will be buffered.

This may cause DoS.
