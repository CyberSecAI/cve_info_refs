The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This advisory is related to multiple NETGEAR router models and provides remediation information. However, the advisory does not contain information about CVE-2020-35819.

Based on the information found in the advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory states the vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored XSS vulnerability is present. This means that malicious script can be injected and stored within the affected product, which is then executed when other users view the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could potentially lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the user interface
    - Phishing attacks
    - Unauthorized access to user data
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
The advisory does not specify how the XSS vulnerability can be injected. However, typical attack vectors for stored XSS include:
   - Injecting malicious code in form fields.
   - Injecting malicious code through vulnerable API endpoints that save data without sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would likely need to have access to the router's administrative interface or a way to inject data that is stored and later displayed to other users. Specifically, the CVSS vector indicates high privileges are needed (PR:H) to trigger this vulnerability. Furthermore, the attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning that the attacker would need to be on the same network as the device. This implies that the attacker needs to be a local admin.

The advisory also provides the following information:
  - Affected products and firmware versions.
  - Instructions on how to download the latest firmware.
  - CVSS v3 score and vector.
  - Contact information for reporting security vulnerabilities.
  - Revision history.
  - List of all affected products.

**Note:** The advisory clearly states, "Associated CVE IDs: None". This means that while the document is a security advisory detailing a vulnerability, it is not associated with any specific CVE, including CVE-2020-35819.

Therefore, given the lack of relation to CVE-2020-35819, the response is:
