The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35948, not CVE-2020-35950. However, it describes another vulnerability, which does not have a CVE ID yet in the article.

**Vulnerability 1: Unprotected AJAX Action to Arbitrary File Overwrite and Sensitive Information Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The `wp_ajax_restore_backup` AJAX action in the XCloner Backup and Restore plugin does not implement the same access control checks as other AJAX actions. Specifically it does not use the `check_access()` function and low level users can therefore access functions within the `xcloner_restore.php` file.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing authentication/authorization checks on the `wp_ajax_restore_backup` AJAX endpoint, leading to access of sensitive functions by low-privilege users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Attackers can use the `write_file_action` function to overwrite any files on the server, including critical files like `wp-config.php`, leading to complete website takeover.
    *   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use the `get_current_directory_action` function to retrieve SQL database credentials and the absolute path of the website installation. This can lead to database access and further malicious activity.
    *   **Exploit Chaining:** Attackers can chain the exploitation of multiple functions to create a full SQL database dump.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks via HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Authenticated users, even with subscriber-level capabilities, can exploit this vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing CSRF protection (nonces and corresponding checks) in almost all AJAX endpoints of the plugin.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of CSRF protection, allowing unauthorized actions to be triggered on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers can trigger a backup or update plugin options via crafted malicious websites, along with any of the malicious activity outlined with the AJAX endpoint vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks via malicious websites, emails, or other methods to trigger requests to vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to trick an authenticated user into triggering the malicious request.
