The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35175.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `frappe.client` API did not properly validate the HTTP method used in requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The API accepted requests with any HTTP method, including methods that should not be allowed for certain operations.
- Lack of Method Restriction: There was no enforcement to ensure that specific API calls were only made with the expected HTTP methods (e.g., POST for data creation or modification, GET for retrieval).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially bypass intended access control and invoke functions or actions on the server that should not be exposed via the HTTP method used in the request. For example, a GET request could be used where a POST was required. This could lead to unauthorized data manipulation or retrieval.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a request to the `frappe.client` API endpoint with an incorrect HTTP method.
- Manipulating the HTTP method of a request to perform an action that is not intended for the given method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `frappe.client` API endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the API structure.
