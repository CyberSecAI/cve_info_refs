# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

## Introduction

**Autobahn|Python** is a subproject of [Autobahn](https://crossbar.io/autobahn) and provides open-source
implementations of

* [The WebSocket Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)
* [The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)](https://wamp-proto.org/)

for Python 3.7+ and running on [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/) and [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

You can use **Autobahn|Python** to create clients and servers in Python speaking just plain WebSocket or WAMP.

**WebSocket** allows [bidirectional real-time messaging on the Web](https://crossbario.com/blog/post/websocket-why-what-can-i-use-it/) and beyond, while [WAMP](https://wamp-proto.org/) adds real-time application communication on top of WebSocket.

**WAMP** provides asynchronous **Remote Procedure Calls** and **Publish & Subscribe** for applications in *one* protocol running over [WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455). WAMP is a *routed* protocol, so you need a **WAMP Router** to connect your **Autobahn|Python** based clients. We provide [Crossbar.io](https://crossbar.io), but there are [other options](https://wamp-proto.org/implementations.html#routers) as well.

Note

**Autobahn|Python** up to version v19.11.2 supported Python 2 and 3.4+,
and up to version v20.7.1 supported Python 3.5+,
and up to version v21.2.1 supported Python 3.6+.

## Features

* framework for [WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) and [WAMP](https://wamp-proto.org/) clients and servers
* runs on [CPython](https://python.org/) and PyPy <<https://pypy.org/>>
* runs under [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/) and [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) - implements WebSocket
  [RFC6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) and Draft Hybi-10+
* implements [WebSocket compression](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-permessage-compression)
* implements [WAMP](https://wamp-proto.org/), the Web Application Messaging Protocol
* high-performance, fully asynchronous implementation
* best-in-class standards conformance (100% strict passes with [Autobahn Testsuite](https://crossbar.io/autobahn#testsuite): [Client](https://autobahn.ws/testsuite/reports/clients/index.html) [Server](https://autobahn.ws/testsuite/reports/servers/index.html))
* message-, frame- and streaming-APIs for WebSocket
* supports TLS (secure WebSocket) and proxies
* Open-source ([MIT license](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/blob/master/LICENSE))

## Show me some code

To give you a first impression, here are two examples. We have lot more [in the repo](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/tree/master/examples).

### WebSocket Echo Server

Here is a simple WebSocket Echo Server that will echo back any WebSocket
message received:

```
from autobahn.twisted.websocket import WebSocketServerProtocol
# or: from autobahn.asyncio.websocket import WebSocketServerProtocol

class MyServerProtocol(WebSocketServerProtocol):

    def onConnect(self, request):
        print("Client connecting: {}".format(request.peer))

    def onOpen(self):
        print("WebSocket connection open.")

    def onMessage(self, payload, isBinary):
        if isBinary:
            print("Binary message received: {} bytes".format(len(payload)))
        else:
            print("Text message received: {}".format(payload.decode('utf8')))

        # echo back message verbatim
        self.sendMessage(payload, isBinary)

    def onClose(self, wasClean, code, reason):
        print("WebSocket connection closed: {}".format(reason))
```

To actually run above server protocol, you need some lines of [boilerplate](https://autobahn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/websocket/programming.html#running-a-server).

### WAMP Application Component

Here is a WAMP Application Component that performs all four types of
actions that WAMP provides:

1. **subscribe** to a topic
2. **publish** an event
3. **register** a procedure
4. **call** a procedure

```
from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession
# or: from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession

class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

    @inlineCallbacks
    def onJoin(self, details):

        # 1. subscribe to a topic so we receive events
        def onevent(msg):
            print("Got event: {}".format(msg))

        yield self.subscribe(onevent, 'com.myapp.hello')

        # 2. publish an event to a topic
        self.publish('com.myapp.hello', 'Hello, world!')

        # 3. register a procedure for remote calling
        def add2(x, y):
            return x + y

        self.register(add2, 'com.myapp.add2')

        # 4. call a remote procedure
        res = yield self.call('com.myapp.add2', 2, 3)
        print("Got result: {}".format(res))
```

Above code will work on Twisted and asyncio by changing a single line
(the base class of `MyComponent`). To actually run above application component, you need some lines of [boilerplate](https://autobahn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wamp/programming.html#running-components) and a [WAMP Router](https://autobahn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wamp/programming.html#running-a-wamp-router).

## Extensions

### Networking framework

Autobahn runs on both Twisted and asyncio. To select the respective netoworking framework, install flavor:

* `asyncio`: Install asyncio (when on Python 2, otherwise it's included in the standard library already) and asyncio support in Autobahn
* `twisted`: Install Twisted and Twisted support in Autobahn

---

### WebSocket acceleration and compression

* `accelerate`: Install WebSocket acceleration - *Only use on CPython - not on PyPy (which is faster natively)*
* `compress`: Install (non-standard) WebSocket compressors **bzip2** and **snappy** (standard **deflate** based WebSocket compression is already included in the base install)

---

### Encryption and WAMP authentication

Autobahn supports running over TLS (for WebSocket and all WAMP transports) as well as **WAMP-cryposign** authentication.

To install use this flavor:

* `encryption`: Installs TLS and WAMP-cryptosign dependencies

Autobahn also supports **WAMP-SCRAM** authentication. To install:

* `scram`: Installs WAMP-SCRAM dependencies

---

### XBR

Autobahn includes support for [XBR](https://xbr.network/). To install use this flavor:

* `xbr`:

To install:

```
pip install autobahn[xbr]
```

or (Twisted, with more bells an whistles)

```
pip install autobahn[twisted,encryption,serialization,xbr]
```

or (asyncio, with more bells an whistles)

```
pip install autobahn[asyncio,encryption,serialization,xbr]
```

---

### Native vector extensions (NVX)

> This is NOT yet complete - ALPHA!

Autobahn contains **NVX**, a network accelerator library that provides SIMD accelerated native vector code for WebSocket (XOR masking) and UTF-8 validation.

---

### WAMP Serializers

* `serialization`: To install additional WAMP serializers: CBOR, MessagePack, UBJSON and Flatbuffers

**Above is for advanced uses. In general we recommend to use CBOR where you can,
and JSON (from the standard library) otherwise.**

---

To install Autobahn with all available serializers:

```
pip install autobahn[serializers]
```

or (development install)

```
pip install -e .[serializers]
```

Further, to speed up JSON on CPython using `ujson`, set the environment variable:

```
AUTOBAHN_USE_UJSON=1
```

Warning

Using `ujson` (on both CPython and PyPy) will break the ability of Autobahn
to transport and translate binary application payloads in WAMP transparently.
This ability depends on features of the regular JSON standard library module
not available on `ujson`.

  malicious client to make the server waste much more memory than the
  bandwidth the client uses.
