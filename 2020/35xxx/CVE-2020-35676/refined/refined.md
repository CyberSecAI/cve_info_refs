The provided content indicates that the described vulnerability is a stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the online invoicing system due to an issue with how user-supplied data is handled, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the system's database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability. This type of vulnerability occurs when user input is saved by the application and is later displayed without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that are then executed by other users who access the affected application functionality. This could allow an attacker to:
*   Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Deface the application's interface.
*   Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a data field that is later stored in the system's database. When a victim views the data, the injected script will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to input data into a field which is stored and later displayed to other users, likely requiring an authenticated user. The content mentions "stored XSS vulnerability (as reported by @maxim)". This suggests the vulnerability is located in a data storage section, and that it was found by an external security researcher.
