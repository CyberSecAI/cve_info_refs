The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0485, affecting multiple router and Orbi WiFi system models. This advisory, while not directly referencing CVE-2020-35805, provides vulnerability information that is useful for analysis.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the web interface of the affected NETGEAR routers and Orbi WiFi systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts can be injected into the router's configuration, which are then executed in the browsers of other users who access the same configuration pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact includes the potential for an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of other users' browsers who access the router's management interface. This could allow attackers to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of users, or redirect to malicious websites.
- Since the CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality and integrity, the vulnerability could result in data breaches and unauthorized modification of the router settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the web management interface of the affected NETGEAR devices.
- An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript into a field or parameter that is stored by the device and later rendered within the management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface of the router to inject the malicious script. This could be achieved by having administrator privileges or by exploiting another vulnerability that provides access to this interface.
- The CVSS vector indicates that the attack requires high privileges and that the attack can be executed from an adjacent network (AV:A, PR:H).

**Additional Information**
- This advisory provides a list of specific NETGEAR product models and firmware versions affected.
- It includes a CVSS v3 score (6.1 Medium) and vector (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N), clarifying the scope and nature of the vulnerability.
- NETGEAR recommends updating to the latest firmware to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The advisory also gives contact information for reporting new security vulnerabilities.

Although this advisory does not directly mention CVE-2020-35805, it provides a detailed breakdown of the underlying vulnerability type, its impact, and attack vectors, which may be relevant to understanding the issues addressed in the CVE description.
