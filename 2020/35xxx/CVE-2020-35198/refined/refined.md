{
  "CVE-2020-35198": {
    "Description": "The APIs cacheDmaMalloc()/cacheArchDmaMalloc()/mmap64() align the size of the requested buffer with the memory page size of the target platform. If the requested size is large enough to cause integer overflow by the alignment calculation, a valid pointer to a buffer that is smaller than the requested size is returned, opening the door to use for heap overflow attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in memory allocation size calculation",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Heap overflow, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network (if triggered by network data)",
      "Local (if triggered by local operation)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to control or influence the size of the requested buffer, may require local or network access depending on the specific trigger"
  }
