{
  "CVE-2020-35766": {
    "Description": "The OpenDKIM library uses a fixed path `/tmp/testkeys` for temporary test keys. This can lead to a vulnerability due to insecure temporary file handling.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of a fixed, predictable path `/tmp/testkeys` for storing temporary files during testing. This makes it vulnerable to insecure temporary file issues.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Temporary File handling",
       "Predictable file path"
    ],
    "Impact": "The use of a fixed path in `/tmp` can lead to potential information disclosure, file manipulation, or other attacks if an attacker can predict or control file creation in this location.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by either creating files at this location before the application, or by monitoring the directory for newly created files. This depends on what is being stored there.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need local access to the system where the test suite is run. The attacker would also need the ability to create files in /tmp directory."
