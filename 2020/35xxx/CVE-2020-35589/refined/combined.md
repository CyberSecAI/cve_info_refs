# WordPress Plugin Limit Login Attempts Reloaded - Multiple Vulnerabilities

* Dec 14, 2020
* 5 minutes read

[![]()](https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/wordpress-plugin-limit-login-attempts-reloaded/ "WordPress Plugin Limit Login Attempts Reloaded - Multiple Vulnerabilities")
## TL;DR

**1 - Rate Limit Bypass**: In a non-standard configuration, the client IP header accepts any arbitrary string. When randomizing the header input, the login count does never reach the maximum allowed retries.

**2 - Reflected XSS**: When logged as WordPress administrator, the **tab** URL parameter in */wp-admin/options-general.php?page=limit-login-attempts*

## Plugin Information

* **Plugin name:** Limit Login Attempts Reloaded
* **Affected version:** >= 2.13.0
* **Plugin Web Page:** <https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts-reloaded/>

This WordPress plugin is aimed to be a bruteforce attack protection mechanism, and is currently installed in more than **1 million** of active installations.

However, during a quick auditing of the plugin, I’ve found two issues. One is a rate limiting bypass under a non-default configuration, which effectively defeats the plugin purpose. The other one is an unauthenticated reflected XSS.

We tried to contact the WordPress plugin team and the developer directly, but received no response. As of today, the vulnerabilities are fixed, so I am releasing the full disclosure.

It is recommended to update to the latest version.

## Vulnerability Details

### **1 - Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (Rate Limit Bypass on login page) - CWE-307**

* **Summary:** When the plugin is configured to accept an arbitrary header as client source IP address, a malicious user is not limited to perform a brute force attack, because the client IP header accepts any arbitrary string. When randomizing the header input, the login count does never reach the maximum allowed retries.
* **Prerequisites:** The plugin needs to be installed and activated on WordPress. On plugin settings page, the *Trusted IP Origins* has to be configured for an arbitrary header, for example *X-Forwarded-For*.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2020-35590](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35590) | [**9.8** (Critical)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35590)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A necessary prerequisite is to configure a custom header on the plugin settings page, in the *Trusted IP Origins*, including for example *X-Forwarded-For*.

The configuration page can be as the following picture:

![Required configuration](/images/3fee03c44d3491ae26a6c5a1897f43e7.png)

Please note that in some networking scenarios this configuration is possible. Indeed, there might be present load balancers or reverse proxies in front of the WordPress instance.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** <http://hostname/wp-login.php>
* **HTTP Parameter:** X-Forwarded-For

In normal condition, when there is no custom *Trusted IP Origin* header configured, or if the header value is always the same value, an attacker is **not** able to perform an attack, because the login limit is enforced by the plugin.

Indeed, the classic password only brute force is blocked, as depicted by the following pictures:

![Required configuration](/images/10cee3515c3a26d67e8b1e6dc8e089ab.png)

The attacker can use a word list in the password value:

![Required configuration](/images/9409c50002dfff8cf4ae26db2572af40.png)

After few attempts, the plugin in the default configuration successfully stops the attacker:

![Required configuration](/images/62528178fd67b903a87751ef2db26ca0.png)

However, the **X-Forwarded-For** value is not validated to be an IP address or an array of IP addresses (some load balancers could use a comma-separated list as value).

Indeed, if a malicious user adds the **X-Forwarded-For** header on the login request, can test for the authentication rate limit bypass.

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payload used.

![Required configuration](/images/83bd20eddaeb475c56244b2fe63cb365.png)

The first set of values is the word list used for testing the password value:

![Required configuration](/images/a2b2bb006b2755547f9cea621ef876f9.png)

The second list can be every string, even simply incrementing the numbers from 1 to 10:

![Required configuration](/images/a74e12d142d248c2dbeb26c3da5b861c.png)

Indeed, the attacker is able to bypass the limit and potentially found the login credentials:

![Required configuration](/images/ae90b88a08842a87e672f46618815258.png)

Please note that custom headers are allowed using the following format, as an example:

* **Plugin settings value name:** HTTP\_X\_PIPPO
* **HTTP request header name:** X-Pippo

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability, changing the value of *X-Forwarded-For* on every attempt:

```
POST /wp-login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: wordpress
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
X-Forwarded-For: 1
Connection: close
Cookie: wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

log=admin&pwd=password&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1

```

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to perform an arbitrary number of authentication attempts using different passwords, and eventually gain access to the targeted account.

**Brute-force tool**

I have released a brute-force tool on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/N4nj0/CVE-2020-35590).

### **2 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Reflected Cross-Site Scripting) - CWE-79**

* **Summary:** An authenticated remote user is able to inject arbitrary web script or HTML due to incorrect sanitization of user-supplied data and achieve a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack against the platform administrators.
* **Prerequisites:** The plugin needs to be installed and activated on WordPress. No special configuration is required to reproduce the issue.
* **CVE and CVSS Score:** [CVE-2020-35589](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35589) | [**5.4** (Medium)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35589)

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A malicious user can cause an administrator user to supply dangerous content to the vulnerable page, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims.

**Affected Endpoints:**

* **URL:** <http://wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=limit-login-attempts>
* **HTTP Parameter:** tab

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

While the administrator user is logged in to WordPress, visit the page in the payload section.

The data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response:

![Required configuration](/images/302048013468d6eba771107208a3dad7.png)

Execution of the JavaScript payload in the browser context:

![Required configuration](/images/33140a21ad94526170270a3d087c2a9d.png)

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

```
http://wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=limit-login-attempts&tab=d7raf"><script>alert(1)</script>

```

Please note that the **options-general.php** page is only available to WordPress administrators. Lower privileged users are not affected because the page is forbidden for them (error 403).

**Security Impact**

By exploiting this issue an attacker is able to target administrator users who are able to access the plugin configuration page within the browser with several type of direct or indirect impacts such as stealing cookies (if the HttpOnly flag is missing from the session cookies), modifying a web page, capturing clipboard contents, keylogging, port scanning, dynamic downloads and other attacks. This type of reflected XSS does require user interaction.

## Description

[Limit Login Attempts Reloaded](https://www.limitloginattempts.com) functions as a robust deterrent against [brute force attacks](https://www.limitloginattempts.com/cracking-the-code-unveiling-the-mechanics-behind-brute-force-attacks/), bolstering your website’s security measures and optimizing its performance. It achieves this by **restricting the number of login attempts allowed**. This applies not only to the standard login method, but also to XMLRPC, Woocommerce, and custom login pages. With more than 2.5 million active users, this plugin fulfills all your login security requirements.

The plugin functions by automatically preventing further attempts from a particular Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or username once a predetermined limit of retries has been surpassed. This significantly weakens the effectiveness of brute force attacks on your website.

By default, WordPress permits an unlimited number of login attempts, posing a vulnerability where passwords can be easily deciphered through brute force methods.

## FAQ

### What do I do if all users get blocked?

If you are using contemporary hosting, it’s likely your site uses a proxy domain service like CloudFlare, Sucuri, Nginx, etc. They replace your user’s IP address with their own. If your server is not configured properly, all users will get the same IP address. This also applies to bots and hackers. Therefore, locking one user will lead to locking everybody else out. In the free version of the plugin, this can be adjusted using the Trusted IP Origin setting. In the premium version, the cloud service intelligently recognizes the non-standard IP origins and handles them correctly, even if your hosting provider does not.

### How do I know if I’m under attack?

An easy way to check if the attack is legitimate is to copy the IP address from the lockout notification and check its location using a IP locator tool. If the location is not somewhere you recognize and you have received several failed login attempts, then you are likely being attacked. You might notice dozens or hundreds of IPs each day. Visit our website to learn how can you [prevent brute force attacks](https://www.limitloginattempts.com/brute-force-attack-protection-the-best-tools-tips-to-keep-your-website-safe/) on your website.

### How can I tell that the premium plugin is working?

After you upgrade to our premium version, you will see a new dashboard in your WordPress admin that shows all attacks that will now relay through our cloud service. On the graph, you’ll see **requests** and **failed login attempts**. Each request will represent the cloud app validating an IP, which also includes denied logins.

In some cases, you may notice an increase in speed and efficiency with your website. Also, a reduction in lockout notifications via email.

### Could these failed login attempts be fake?

Some users find it hard to believe that they could experience numerous unsuccessful login attempts, particularly when their site has just been established or has minimal human traffic. The plugin is not responsible for generating these failed login attempts. Newly created websites are frequently hosted on shared IP addresses, making it easy for hackers to discover them. Additionally, newly registered domain names are often crawled soon after creation, rendering a WordPress website susceptible to attacks. Such websites are attractive targets as security is not a primary concern for their owners. We’ve created an article that delves deeper into the issue of [fake login attempts in WordPress](https://www.limitloginattempts.com/could-these-failed-login-attempts-be-fake/).

### What happens if my site exceeds the request limits in the plan?

The premium plan’s resource limits start from 100,000 requests per month, which should accept almost any heavy brute-force attack. We monitor all of our sites and will alert the user if it appears they are going over their limits. If limits are reached, we will suggest to the user upgrading to the next plan. If you are using the free version, the load caused by brute force attacks will be absorbed by your current hosting bandwidth, which could cause your hosting costs to increase.

### What URLs are being attacked and protected?

The URLs being protected are your login page (wp-login.php, wp-admin), xmlrpc.php, WooCommerce login page, and any custom login page you have that uses regular WordPress login hooks.

### Why is LLAR more popular than other brute-force protection plugins?

Our main focus is protecting your site from brute force attacks. This allows our plugin to be very lean and effective. It doesn’t require a lot of your web hosting resources and keeps your site well-protected. More importantly, it does all of this automatically as our service learns on its own about each IP it encounters. In contrast, a firewall would require manual [blocking of IPs](https://www.limitloginattempts.com/should-i-block-ip-addresses/).

### What to do when an admin gets blocked?

Open the site from another IP. You can do this from your cell phone, or using Opera browser and enabling free VPN there. You can also try turning off your router for a few minutes and then see if you get a different IP address. These will work if your hosting server is configured correctly. If that doesn’t work, connect to the site using FTP or your hosting control panel file manager. Navigate to wp-content/plugins/ and rename the limit-login-attempts-reloaded folder. Log in to the site then rename that folder back and whitelist your IP. By upgrading to our premium app, you will have the unlocking functionality right from the cloud so you’ll never have to deal with this issue.

### What settings should I use In the plugin?

The settings are explained within the plugin in great detail. If you are unsure, use the default settings as they are the recommended ones.

### Can I share the safelist/denylist throughout all of my sites?

By default, you will need to copy and paste the lists to each site manually. For the [premium service](https://www.limitloginattempts.com/plans/?from=wp-details), sites are grouped within the same private cloud account. Each site within that group can be configured if it shares its lockouts and access lists with other group members. The setting is located in the plugin’s interface. The default options are recommended.
