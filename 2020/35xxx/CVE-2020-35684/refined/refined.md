{
  "CVE-2020-35684": {
    "Root cause": "The code that parses TCP packets relies on an unchecked value of the IP payload size (extracted from the IP header) to compute the length of the TCP payload within the TCP checksum computation function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A low-impact write-out-of-bounds is also possible. A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted network packets. Remote network access.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker with the ability to send network packets to a vulnerable device can trigger this vulnerability."
