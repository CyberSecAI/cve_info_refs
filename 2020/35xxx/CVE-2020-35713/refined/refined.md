Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the `/goform/setSysAdm` webpage. Specifically, the `admpass` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a `system()` call. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the command executed by the device's operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is that the `/goform/setSysAdm` page can be accessed without any authentication. An attacker can send a crafted request to this page and execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `admpass` parameter is taken directly and used in a `system()` call without sanitizing or validating it, leading to the injection vulnerability.
*   **Vulnerable `system()` Call:** The use of `system()` with user-controlled input opens the door for direct execution of shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** An attacker can achieve full control of the affected device by executing arbitrary commands. This may include installing malware, changing device settings, accessing sensitive information, or disrupting network services.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information stored on the device.
*   **Botnet Recruitment:** The affected devices could be recruited into a botnet.
*   **Denial of Service:** The device can be rendered unusable via a soft "brick" if the injected command corrupts crucial system files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setSysAdm` endpoint.
*   **`admpass` Parameter:** The malicious commands are injected via the `admpass` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device. This can be over the local network or potentially over the internet if the device's management interface is exposed.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any pre-existing credentials or need to bypass any authentication mechanisms to perform this attack.
