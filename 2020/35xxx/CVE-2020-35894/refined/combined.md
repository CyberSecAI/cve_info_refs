# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Description

Obstack generates unaligned references for types that require a large alignment.

# Demonstration

* Crate: obstack
* Version: 0.1.3
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
* Rust: rustc 1.46.0 (04488afe3 2020-08-24)
* Cargo flags: --release

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use obstack::Obstack;

#[repr(align(256))]
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct LargeAlign(u8);

fn main() {
    // https://github.com/petertodd/rust-obstack/blob/e1dde0dbed709ebdea9bd1f79ec718e80c5d0bf6/src/lib.rs#L317-L337
    // Line 322: Incorrect padding bytes calculation. It should be `(alignment - (start_ptr % alignment)) % alignment`.
    // Line 329: Wasted memory due to `bytes_to_item()` not being applied to `padding`.

    // Due to the incorrect padding calculation, the code generates unaligned reference in release mode.
    let obstack = Obstack::new();
    let val_ref = obstack.push_copy(LargeAlign(0));

    let address = val_ref as *mut _ as usize;
    println!("{:x}", address);
    assert!(address % std::mem::align_of::<LargeAlign>() == 0);
}
```

Output:

```
55bc0c2fc520
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: address % std::mem::align_of::<LargeAlign>() == 0', src/main.rs:39:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

```

Return Code: 101
