Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `obstack` crate generates unaligned memory references for types that require a large alignment due to an error in calculating padding. Specifically, the padding calculation was `start_ptr as usize % alignment` instead of `(alignment - (start_ptr % alignment)) % alignment`. Additionally, `bytes_to_item()` was not applied to padding, leading to wasted memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Padding Calculation:** The core issue lies in the flawed padding calculation within the `alloc` function of the `obstack` crate. This leads to the allocation of memory that is not correctly aligned for types requiring larger alignment, such as structures with `#[repr(align(256))]`.
- **Memory Corruption:** By returning an unaligned pointer, the code could potentially corrupt memory, because some architectures require data to be aligned on specific boundaries.
- **Unsoundness:** The vulnerability causes unsoundness within the Rust code because it violates alignment requirements which are critical for memory safety.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for data corruption due to misaligned memory access. Writing to or reading from misaligned memory can cause unpredictable behavior, and potentially crash the program.
- **Program Instability:** Due to the unsoundness of the code, the program could crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is classified as "Network", although this seems to imply that the vulnerable code could be part of a network application. However, there is no direct networking component involved in the vulnerability itself and it's more appropriate to think of this as a local issue impacting applications which uses the `obstack` crate.
- **Local Application:** Any application using the vulnerable version of `obstack` can be affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or user interaction to trigger this vulnerability. They only need to execute code that uses the vulnerable `obstack` crate and allocates types with large alignment requirements.
- This issue can be triggered by a local user that is running an application using the vulnerable code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `alloc` function within `src/lib.rs` of the `rust-obstack` crate.
- The fix was to correct the padding calculation and the way bytes are converted to items with `AlignedVec::<A>::bytes_to_items(padding)`.
- Affected versions are below 0.1.4. Version 0.1.4 includes the patch.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) due to the potential for data corruption.
