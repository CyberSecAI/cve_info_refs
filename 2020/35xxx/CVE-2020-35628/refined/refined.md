Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper bounds checking when reading indices from a file that is used to access vectors of objects in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the `SNC_io_parser` reads and processes `.nef` files which define geometric structures. The parser reads integer indices from the file, and uses them to access elements within various vectors that store geometric objects (vertices, edges, faces, etc.). However, it does not validate if these indices are within the bounds of these vectors before accessing them, leading to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability that occurs when processing a crafted `.nef` file. The parser attempts to access a memory location outside of the bounds of an array, vector or similar data structure.
- **Type Confusion:** Due to the arbitrary assignment of object pointers, type confusion occurs when the code attempts to dereference pointers which now point to memory locations which do not contain the expected object type.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The lack of index validation is the core vulnerability. The parser blindly trusts the indices provided in the input file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution. By manipulating the indices in a malformed `.nef` input file, an attacker could cause the application to read from an invalid memory location, leading to a crash. Further, the ability to create type confusion could allow an attacker to gain control of execution flow and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted `.nef` file to an application using CGAL. The file is designed to contain invalid indices that trigger the out-of-bounds read and type confusion.
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the malicious `.nef` file using the vulnerable CGAL library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious .nef file as input to an application that uses the vulnerable CGAL library.
-   **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability does not require any elevated privileges to exploit, making it more dangerous to a wider range of users.

**Specifically for CVE-2020-35628:**

- The vulnerability is located in `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h`
- The vulnerable function is `SNC_io_parser::read_sloop()`
- The specific out-of-bounds read occurs when accessing `slh->incident_sface`

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

In the `read_sloop` function, which reads the data for a `SHalfloop_handle`, the code reads an index from the file and directly uses it to access the `SFace_of` vector at the index to assign it to  `slh->incident_sface`. If the index read from the file is out of bounds for `SFace_of`, it results in an out of bounds read.

**Additional Details from the Talos Report:**
The Talos report provides significantly more detail, including specific code snippets, and details the same root cause across numerous other related CVEs.
The report also provides crash information and explains how the incorrect indices lead to memory corruption and code execution.

In summary, CVE-2020-35628 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in CGAL's Nef polygon parsing code, specifically during the processing of a `SHalfloop_handle`, allowing for potential code execution by providing a specially crafted .nef file.
