Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35860:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `CBox` and `CSemiBox` APIs in the `cbox` crate allow the creation of smart pointers from raw pointers and dereference them without requiring `unsafe` code. This allows for the dereferencing of arbitrary raw pointers, including null pointers, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unsafe dereferencing:** The crate allows dereferencing raw pointers without the necessary `unsafe` block, violating Rust's safety guarantees.
- **Null pointer dereference:** The ability to create `CBox` instances from potentially invalid pointers, such as `null_mut`, leads to null pointer dereference vulnerabilities.
- **Memory corruption**: By dereferencing invalid pointers, arbitrary memory locations can be accessed, leading to potential corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Segmentation fault/crash:** Dereferencing invalid pointers will cause the program to crash, leading to denial of service.
- **Arbitrary code execution (potential):** While not explicitly stated, dereferencing arbitrary raw pointers can potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution by gaining control of the program's memory.
- **Information disclosure (potential):** Dereferencing memory using arbitrary pointers could lead to reading sensitive memory content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker through a network connection.
- **Local:** Exploitation may also be possible through local code execution within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges required.
- No user interaction is required.
- Attack complexity is low.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code that uses the vulnerable `cbox` crate.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the cbox crate version <= 0.3.0.
- There are no patched versions available.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a memory corruption issue, specifically a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- The CVSS score is 9.8, categorized as CRITICAL.
- The EPSS score is 1.222%, indicating a relatively low likelihood of exploitation.
