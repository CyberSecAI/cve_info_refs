{
  "CVE-2020-35111": {
    "root_cause": "The proxy.onRequest API in Firefox extensions did not trigger for 'view-source:' URLs when using the <all_urls> filter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The proxy.onRequest API did not handle 'view-source:' URLs correctly.",
      "The <all_urls> filter was not inclusive of the 'view-source:' scheme."
    ],
    "impact": "A user's IP address could be inadvertently leaked when opening 'view-source:' URLs if they were using a proxy extension that relied on the proxy.onRequest API.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user opening 'view-source:' on a page while using an affected proxy extension."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The user must have a Firefox extension installed with the proxy permission using the proxy.onRequest API and listening to <all_urls>. The user also needs to open a 'view-source:' URL.",
     "details": "The issue stemmed from `ChannelWrapper::Matches` returning false for 'view-source:' URLs, preventing the proxy.onRequest callback from triggering. A patch was applied to remove the 'view-source' scheme prefix before checking access rules and filters, enabling the proxy API to intercept these requests. This fix was applied to Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6."

 "CVE-2020-26978": {
        "root_cause": "The browser did not block requests to specific ports typically used by protocols such as H.323, PPTP, and RTSP, allowing for potential internal network probing.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Inadequate port blocking for protocols not intended to be used over HTTP(s)."
        ],
        "impact": "A malicious webpage could probe internal network hosts and services running on a user's local machine, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "A malicious webpage initiating a request to a host on a restricted port."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious webpage and entice a user to visit it in a vulnerable browser.",
        "details": "This vulnerability was addressed by adding ports 1720 (H.323), 1723 (PPTP), and 554 (RTSP) to the list of restricted ports in Firefox. This prevents web content from initiating network requests using these ports.  This fix landed in Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6"
