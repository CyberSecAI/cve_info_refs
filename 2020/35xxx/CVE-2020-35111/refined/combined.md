Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

#### [#CVE-2020-16042: Operations on a BigInt could have caused uninitialized memory to be exposed](#CVE-2020-16042)

Reporter
André Bargull
Impact
critical
##### Description

When a BigInt was right-shifted the backing store was not properly cleared, allowing uninitialized memory to be read.

##### References

* [Bug 1679003](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1679003)

#### [#CVE-2020-26971: Heap buffer overflow in WebGL](#CVE-2020-26971)

Reporter
Omair, Abraruddin Khan
Impact
high
##### Description

Certain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading to a heap buffer overflow on some video drivers.

##### References

* [Bug 1663466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26972: Use-After-Free in WebGL](#CVE-2020-26972)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter via the ASAN Nightly project
Impact
high
##### Description

The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors; and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1671382](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1671382)

#### [#CVE-2020-26973: CSS Sanitizer performed incorrect sanitization](#CVE-2020-26973)

Reporter
Kai Engert
Impact
high
##### Description

Certain input to the CSS Sanitizer confused it, resulting in incorrect components being removed. This could have been used as a sanitizer bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1680084](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1680084)

#### [#CVE-2020-26974: Incorrect cast of StyleGenericFlexBasis resulted in a heap use-after-free](#CVE-2020-26974)

Reporter
Pham Bao of VinCSS (Member of Vingroup)
Impact
high
##### Description

When `flex-basis` was used on a table wrapper, a `StyleGenericFlexBasis` object could have been incorrectly cast to the wrong type. This resulted in a heap user-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

#### [#CVE-2020-26975: Malicious applications on Android could have induced Firefox for Android into sending arbitrary attacker-specified headers](#CVE-2020-26975)

Reporter
Pedro Oliveira
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a malicious application installed on the user's device broadcast an Intent to Firefox for Android, arbitrary headers could have been specified, leading to attacks such as abusing ambient authority or session fixation. This was resolved by only allowing certain safe-listed headers.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1661071](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661071)

#### [#CVE-2020-26976: HTTPS pages could have been intercepted by a registered service worker when they should not have been](#CVE-2020-26976)

Reporter
Andrew Sutherland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a HTTPS pages was embedded in a HTTP page, and there was a service worker registered for the former, the service worker could have intercepted the request for the secure page despite the iframe not being a secure context due to the (insecure) framing.

* [Bug 1676311](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1676311)

#### [#CVE-2020-26978: Internal network hosts could have been probed by a malicious webpage](#CVE-2020-26978)

Reporter
Samy Kamkar, Ben Seri, and Gregory Vishnepolsky
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine.

##### References

* [Bug 1677047](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677047)

#### [#CVE-2020-26979: When entering an address in the address or search bars, a website could have redirected the user before they were navigated to the intended url](#CVE-2020-26979)

Reporter
David Schütz
Impact
low
##### Description

When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it.

##### References

* [Bug 1641287, 1673299](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1641287%2C1673299)

#### [#CVE-2020-35111: The proxy.onRequest API did not catch view-source URLs](#CVE-2020-35111)

Reporter
Yassine Tioual
Impact
low
##### Description

When an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive `<all_urls>`, the proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web content cannot navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have inadvertently leaked their IP address.

##### References

* [Bug 1657916](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657916)

#### [#CVE-2020-35112: Opening an extension-less download may have inadvertently launched an executable instead](#CVE-2020-35112)

Reporter
Samuel Attard via the Chrome Security Team
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user downloaded a file lacking an extension on Windows, and then "Open"-ed it from the downloads panel, if there was an executable file in the downloads directory with the same name but with an executable extension (such as .bat or .exe) that executable would have been launched instead.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Christian Holler
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developer Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-16042: Operations on a BigInt could have caused uninitialized memory to be exposed](#CVE-2020-16042)

Reporter
André Bargull
Impact
critical
##### Description

When a BigInt was right-shifted the backing store was not properly cleared, allowing uninitialized memory to be read.

##### References

* [Bug 1679003](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1679003)

#### [#CVE-2020-26971: Heap buffer overflow in WebGL](#CVE-2020-26971)

Reporter
Omair, Abraruddin Khan
Impact
high
##### Description

Certain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading to a heap buffer overflow on some video drivers.

##### References

* [Bug 1663466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26973: CSS Sanitizer performed incorrect sanitization](#CVE-2020-26973)

Reporter
Kai Engert
Impact
high
##### Description

Certain input to the CSS Sanitizer confused it, resulting in incorrect components being removed. This could have been used as a sanitizer bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1680084](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1680084)

#### [#CVE-2020-26974: Incorrect cast of StyleGenericFlexBasis resulted in a heap use-after-free](#CVE-2020-26974)

Reporter
Pham Bao of VinCSS (Member of Vingroup)
Impact
high
##### Description

When `flex-basis` was used on a table wrapper, a `StyleGenericFlexBasis` object could have been incorrectly cast to the wrong type. This resulted in a heap user-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1681022](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1681022)

Reporter
Samy Kamkar, Ben Seri, and Gregory Vishnepolsky
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine.

Reporter
Yassine Tioual
Impact
low
##### Description

When an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive `<all_urls>`, the proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web content cannot navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have inadvertently leaked their IP address.

* [Bug 1657916](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657916)

#### [#CVE-2020-35112: Opening an extension-less download may have inadvertently launched an executable instead](#CVE-2020-35112)

Reporter
Samuel Attard via the Chrome Security Team
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user downloaded a file lacking an extension on Windows, and then "Open"-ed it from the downloads panel, if there was an executable file in the downloads directory with the same name but with an executable extension (such as .bat or .exe) that executable would have been launched instead.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Christian Holler
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developer Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

When using FoxyProxy or Proxy SwitchyOmega (the two most downloaded proxy switcher extensions), I noticed that requests do not get proxied when using the "view-source" scheme.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Setup FoxyProxy or Proxy SwitchyOmega to proxy traffic to an external proxy (different public IP address)
2. Go to <https://ipinfo.io/ip> . You'll see the proxy's IP address.
3. Now go to view-source:<https://ipinfo.io/ip?x=x> . You'll see your network's IP address (?x=x is mainly used as a cachebuster to prevent showing the same IP address that was cached after the first request)

This was tested on FoxyProxy 7.5.1 and Proxy SwitchyOmega 2.5.20

Actual results:

This behavior discloses a user's real IP address.

This scenario can happen really often amongst web developpers and security researchers, when the source code is inspected using Ctrl+U and then later on, HTTP parameters are modified (and thus a new request using "view-source" is made) to see the effect they have on the webpage.

When inspecting FoxyProxy, I noticed that they use proxy.onRequest API (which is the recommended way since Firefox 68) to proxy requests:

(background.js lines 185 & 194)

browser.proxy.onRequest.addListener(proxyRequest, {urls: ["<all\_urls>"]});

By setting a break point on the "proxyRequest" function, I noticed that this function is never called when using the "view-source" scheme. The documentation shows that <all\_urls> filter does not support this scheme:

<https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns>

Exploitation of this behavior is pretty much unlikely, as redirecting a user to a URI with a "view-source" scheme will get blocked by the SOP. However, users can inadvertedly leak their IP address.

Expected results:

Even if (to my understanding) FoxyProxy does not support the "view-source" scheme (I plan on opening a bug request once this is resolved), the <all\_urls> filter should be able to include URIs that have "view-source" as a scheme.

I've looked this a bit.

It seems that `ChannelWrapper::Matches` returns false at [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/ab81b8552f4aa9696a2524f97fdfeb59d4dc31c1/toolkit/components/extensions/webrequest/ChannelWrapper.cpp#583-584) because the url is not matched. The final url here is `view-source:https://ipinfo.io/ip?x=x`. I guess the extension code or something else doesn't expect to process the url with `view-source` scheme.

Hello,

I’ve managed to reproduce the issue on the latest Nightly (81.0a1/20200811091731), Beta (80.0b6/20200807195315) and Release (79.0/20200720193547) under Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

I’ve configured both proxy add-ons mentioned in the report with this server address 110.164.253.85 on port 8080. When I’ve accessed <https://ipinfo.io/ip>, the correct proxy address was displayed. Accessing view-source:<https://ipinfo.io/ip?x=x> afterwards, however, displayed the real IP address of my machine (sometimes a refresh was required for the real IP to be displayed), thus confirming the issue.

AFAIU, this is in WebRequest code, so the leak doesn't occur with typical proxy settings. The issue is solely in the APIs we provide for writing proxy-like extensions, correct? I.e., there is no leak when using "typical" proxy settings, correct?

I wonder why folks would use WebRequest when we do have a [proxy API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/proxy)

I would call it sec-low, unless there is a way to trigger a `view-source` load from content. If we (or the reporter) finds a way to leak this from an evil website, I'd rate it sec-moderate.

You are correct, the typical proxy settings are not affected by this leak.

When I inspected both extensions, they do indeed use the Proxy API and not WebRequest, so I guess this is an issue in the Proxy API.

I am still investigating how one could trigger a `view-source` from a controlled page. The only way I found so far is by setting the "security.view-source.reachable-from-inner-protocol" to "true" and setting an attacker-controlled URL as the `src` of an `img` tag in the page, but it requires user interaction so I don't consider this a valid case.

I'll keep you updated if I find a bypass to this.

Bah, that pref still exists? Ugh. Thanks for reminding me. I filed [bug 1661672](/show_bug.cgi?id=1661672 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove/restrict use of security.view-source.reachable-from-inner-protocol") to get rid of it.

The webrequest side of this is [bug 1439163](/show_bug.cgi?id=1439163 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Request made for viewing page source bypasses webrequest listeners"), I think?

Seems like there is confusion here about proxy and webrequest. In terms of a privacy leak, this is a proxy api issue.

In terms of the actual problem, ChannelWrapper is the underlying issue that affects both of them.

[Bug 1657916 allow extensions to see view-source requests](attachment.cgi?id=9173508)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9173508&action=edit)

View source prefixes urls with a view-source scheme. Somewhere along

the way a request is made for the un-prefixed url but we do not intercept. This

removes the prefix for webrequest and proxy APIs prior to checking access rules

and filters, allowing the APIs to intercept those requests that the otherwise

could.

We generally consider proxy bypasses that are triggered from web content in a non-webextension settings as [sec-high](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings/Client), so I wanted to err on the side of caution.

This was under the assumption that the reporter may find a method to bypass a proxy that can be triggered from web content (in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1657916#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - proxy.onRequest does not catch \"view-source\" URIs when used with the <all_urls> filter")). I'd rather have this bug private and turn out less bad as we thought than public and then become worse. As per [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1657916#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - proxy.onRequest does not catch \"view-source\" URIs when used with the <all_urls> filter"), this seems not to be the case? As a sec-low bug, you can just land the patch without any extra approval and we can make the bug public thereafter.

Hello,

Verified the fix using the latest Nightly (84.0a1/20201028092421) under Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Similar to [Comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1657916#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - proxy.onRequest does not catch \"view-source\" URIs when used with the <all_urls> filter"), I’ve configured both add-ons with this server address 103.206.105.193 on port 3629 and accessed <https://ipinfo.io/ip>. The correct proxy address was displayed. Accessing view-source:<https://ipinfo.io/ip?x=x> afterwards, also displayed the proxied address, thus confirming the fix.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: view-source requests are not caught by proxies in extensions, so this is a touch of a leak. We've lived with it for a long time, but since esr is long lived, it would be good to uplift it. We otherwise intend this to just ride the train on normal releases.
* **User impact if declined**: view-source requests may not be proxied
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 84
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: It's a small change with a good set of tests on it.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: less protection for a (yet to be disclosed) bug. Would be great if we could get the fix out soon.
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: Yes
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The port shouldn't be used for HTTP(s) and seldomly is. Users who really need this can override themselves. If there's significant breakage, we can override globally with remote settings
* **String changes made/needed**:

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: blocking a non-HTTP port for HTTP traffic.
* **User impact if declined**: less protection for an (undisclosed) bug
* **Fix Landed on Version**:
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Might be risky if enterprises run stuff on very odd ports in their intranet. We don't have telemetry for this. Users can override with a pref. We can also override the blocking with a remote pref, but I honestly don't know if these overrides would be valid for ESR or if we'd remove the protection on all branches. (Same as <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1674735#c9>), though this issue here is not public yet
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:

Unfortunately I don't and I can't ask.

How are these flipped back by prefs exactly? the bug is changing hardcoded lists.

Do we know of any legitimate uses of these ports?

Hi! I believe the following ports should additionally be blocked (otherwise the same attacks can likely continue to be employed) which I did not see in the two patches above. I've pulled these from the [Linux netfilter source](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/net/netfilter) and [documented them here](https://samy.pl/slipstream/#linux-netfilter)):

* 6566 SANE
* 10080 Amanda

When going over the list, our code will check for the (non-default) `network.security.ports.banned.override` pref.

Any port in that list will not be blocked after all.

I just realized I didn't respond to the comment. This has been fixed in [bug 1677940](/show_bug.cgi?id=1677940 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consider blocking ports 69, 137, 161, 1719, 6566, 10080"), which landed earlier in the week and should be ready for testing in Firefox Nightly.

Can we land this without the websockets hunk, at <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr78/rev/64addb3cd358#l3.2>?

We're effectively hitting <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1349969>, which I don't think is worth uplufting.
