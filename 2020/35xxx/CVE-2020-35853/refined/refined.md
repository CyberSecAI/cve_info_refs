Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the "Profile Image" URL within the 4images application. The application stores the provided URL without sanitizing or encoding it, which allows a malicious user to inject JavaScript code into the image URL field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can:
    - Steal user cookies
    - Potentially perform other actions on behalf of the victim, such as defacing pages, redirecting to malicious websites or accessing user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the "Profile Image" URL field within the 4images admin panel. The attacker can inject JavaScript code into the URL field by crafting a payload like:
`ritesh"><img src=x onerror=confirm(1)>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to the 4images admin panel.
    - They need the ability to add/modify images and related details.
    - The attacker needs to be able to submit the crafted malicious URL payload to the vulnerable field

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit details specifies that the application is 4images v1.7.11, running on PHP, and tested on Windows 10/Kali Linux environments.
- The vulnerability can be triggered each time any user accesses the profile page where the malicious image URL is displayed.
- This is a stored XSS because the malicious code is persisted in the database and executed when the page is rendered by the application.
- The exploit payload given `ritesh"><img src=x onerror=confirm(1)>` shows how the attacker can inject the javascript.
