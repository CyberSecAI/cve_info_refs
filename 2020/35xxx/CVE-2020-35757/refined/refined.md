Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35757:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Libre Wireless LS9 module's web interface allows enabling ADB (Android Debug Bridge) over TCP without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication on the `/goform/SetADBmode` endpoint. This endpoint controls the activation of ADB over TCP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain root access to the LS9 module by enabling ADB over TCP and then connecting to the device using the `adb connect` command. This provides full control over the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to access the device's web interface (port 80). No authentication is required to interact with the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the device to reach the web interface.
- No prior authentication is needed.
