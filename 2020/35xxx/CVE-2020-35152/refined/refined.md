Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35152

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an unquoted service path in Cloudflare WARP for Windows. This means the path to the service executable wasn't enclosed in quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unquoted Service Path: The core vulnerability lies in the fact that the service's binary path was not enclosed in quotation marks. This is a common misconfiguration that allows for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A malicious user or process, even with non-administrative privileges, could exploit this vulnerability to gain administrator-level access.
- System Compromise: By gaining elevated privileges, an attacker could potentially compromise the system, install malware, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Executable Placement: An attacker could place a malicious executable with a name matching part of the unquoted service path in a higher-priority directory within the system's search path.
- Service Start/Restart: When the vulnerable service is started or restarted, Windows will search for the executable. Due to the unquoted path, Windows might execute the attacker's malicious executable instead of the intended service executable if it is found first in the search path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Non-administrative privileges: The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system, but not necessarily administrative.
- File system write access: The attacker needs to be able to place their malicious executable in a directory that Windows will search when starting the service.
- Understanding of service path: The attacker needs to know or determine the unquoted path of the vulnerable service to craft the name of the malicious executable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.2695.1 of Cloudflare WARP for Windows by enclosing the service's binary path in quotes.
- The severity is considered low, however, the potential impact of privilege escalation can be severe.
