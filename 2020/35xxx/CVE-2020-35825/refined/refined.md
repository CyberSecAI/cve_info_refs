The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35825.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the web interface of several Netgear router models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input before it is stored and displayed within the web interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access the affected web interface. This can lead to:
*   Account compromise through session hijacking or stealing of cookies
*   Redirection to malicious websites
*   Defacement of the routerâ€™s web interface
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user, like changing settings
*   Potentially, further compromise of the network through the user's device.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected Netgear routers. The attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code through some input field which is later displayed on the UI. The stored XSS then executes when an administrator or user views the affected interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to access the web interface of the vulnerable router.
*   The attacker must have the ability to provide input that is then stored and rendered on the web interface of the router.
*   Typically, this would require an attacker to have some level of authentication on the device, but could also happen through vulnerabilities that don't require authentication.

**Affected Products/Firmware Versions:**

*   D7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
*   R7500v2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
*   R7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.74
*   R8900, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
*   R9000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
*   RAX120, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78
*   RBK50, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBR50, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBS50, firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   XR500, firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.56
*  XR700, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.10

**Mitigation:**
The document provides the following mitigation steps:
*   Update the firmware to the latest versions available from the NETGEAR support website.
*   Following the update instructions specific to your product.

**Additional Information:**

*   The document mentions a CVSS v3 score of 6.1 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N, which indicates the vulnerability is exploitable on an adjacent network, requires high privileges, no user interaction and impacts confidentiality and integrity but not availability. This might be incorrect as stored XSS does not always require high privileges.
*  The document credits "aircut" for discovering the vulnerability.
