  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of server-side file type verification when importing Divi page templates using the portability feature. While there was a client-side JavaScript file type check, it could be easily bypassed, leading to the ability to upload arbitrary files. The `wp_handle_upload` function was used with `test_type` set to false, which disabled the file type checking protection. Additionally, temporary files were not consistently deleted if the import failed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authenticated arbitrary file upload, missing server-side file type validation, improper use of `wp_handle_upload` function, incomplete temporary file cleanup.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable website and its hosting account.",
  "Attack vectors": "Uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP files) through the Divi Builder's template import feature, bypassing client-side file extension checks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated access to the WordPress site with 'edit_posts' capability (e.g., contributor, author, editor roles). An attacker could also technically exploit this with administrative privileges, but it would require gaining access to an administrative account."
