Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an authentication bypass found in the Asus DSL-N17U modem firmware, specifically in version 1.1.0.2.
*   The root cause is the lack of session or authorization control on the "Advanced\_System\_Content.asp" page.
*   This allows attackers to change the admin password without proper authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism of the modem's web interface.
*   **Lack of Session/Authorization Control:** The "Advanced\_System\_Content.asp" page does not properly check for valid user sessions or authorization before processing requests.
*   **Exposed Password Change Mechanism:** POST request parameters sent to the vulnerable page include the admin user's password information. This allows an attacker to modify those parameters and change the admin password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Control of the Device:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to change the admin password and gain complete control of the modem.
*   **Network Compromise:** With control of the modem, an attacker could potentially intercept network traffic, modify DNS settings, and conduct further attacks on the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted POST request to the "Advanced\_System\_Content.asp" page.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to log in to the administrative interface to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the modem, implying they need to be on the same network or have network access to the modem.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable page and the specific parameters required for password change.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the Security For Everyone team.
*   The vendor, Asus, was contacted and confirmed the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was assigned the CVE ID CVE-2020-35219.
*   Users are advised to update their firmware to the latest version to mitigate the risk.
