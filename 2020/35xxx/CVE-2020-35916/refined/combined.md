[Dependabot alerts

## Package

cargo

image
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.23.12

## Patched versions

0.23.12

## Description

A mutable reference to a struct was constructed by dereferencing a pointer obtained from slice::as\_ptr. Instead, slice::as\_mut\_ptr should have been called on the mutable slice argument. The former performs an implicit reborrow as an immutable shared reference which does not allow writing through the derived pointer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@dodomorandi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/350168?u=0e78e2026d822c8129fb1b80834fca07480c734d&v=4&size=48)[dodomorandi](https://github.com/dodomorandi)opened [on Nov 12, 2020](https://github.com/image-rs/image/issues/1357#issue-741527859)

I just discovered an UB whilst testing another project with miri. ~~`Primitive::from_slice` and~~ `Primitive::from_slice_mut` perform an invalid unsafe cast, which is detected by miri.

EDIT: [#1358](https://github.com/image-rs/image/pull/1358) showed that it is *just* a matter of a wrong `as_ptr` fn, therefore `Primitive::from_slice` is likely to be unaffected.

## Expected

`cargo +nightly miri test` should not raise any problem.

## Actual behaviour

`test buffer_::test::mut_iter` triggers UB.

## Reproduction steps

Just run miri on tests ☺️

### Description

A mutable reference to a struct was constructed by dereferencing a pointer
obtained from `slice::as_ptr`. Instead, `slice::as_mut_ptr` should have been
called on the mutable slice argument. The former performs an implicit reborrow
as an immutable shared reference which does not allow writing through the
derived pointer.

There is no evidence for miscompilation, exploitable or otherwise, caused by
this bug. [Further investigation on Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/146229-wg-secure-code/topic/Implications.20of.20using.20.60slice.3A.3Aas_ptr.60.20for.20mutable.20access/near/216499472) suggests that the unoptimized
generated LLVM IR does not contain any UB itself, effectively mitigating
further effects.
