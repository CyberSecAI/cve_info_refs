Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35895:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ArrayVec::insert` function in the `stack` crate lacks an upper bounds check on the provided index during element insertion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing bounds check: The primary vulnerability lies in the absence of a verification step to ensure the insertion index is within the allocated bounds of the array within the `ArrayVec`.
- Out-of-bounds write: Due to the missing check, it's possible to insert an element at an index beyond the array's capacity, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary memory writes: The vulnerability allows attackers to write arbitrary data to memory locations beyond the allocated buffer.
- Program crash: In a release build, this out-of-bounds write can lead to a segmentation fault (segfault) and the program's termination due to writing into arbitrary memory. In debug mode an integer overflow will cause the program to panic.
- Potential for more severe impacts: While a crash is directly observed, the ability to write arbitrary memory could potentially be exploited for more severe outcomes depending on what memory is overwritten.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The CVSS vector indicates the attack vector is network-based which implies that it is possible to trigger this vulnerability remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges required: Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require any user privileges.
- No user interaction: The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction.
- Low attack complexity: The exploit does not require any specific conditions or complex manipulation.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the `stack` crate prior to 0.3.1.
- The issue was reported on September 24, 2020 and patched in version 0.3.1.
- The GitHub issue #4 for the `arcnmx/stack-rs` repository provides a detailed description of the vulnerability along with example code illustrating the out-of-bounds write.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 9.8.
- The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-h45v-vgvp-3h5v in the GitHub Advisory Database.
- The fix was introduced in commit 369e557 in the `arcnmx/stack-rs` repository.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).
