## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Sep 24, 2020](https://github.com/arcnmx/stack-rs/issues/4#issue-708031917)

`ArrayVec::insert` allows insertion of an element into the array object into the specified index. Due to a missing check on the upperbound of this index, it is possible to write out of bounds.

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use stack::{ArrayVec, Vector, Array};

fn main() {
    // 1. `Vector::insert` is missing an upper bounds-check on its index
    //    allowing for arbitrary memory writes.
    //
    // In debug mode this will panic with integer overflow. In release mode it
    // segfaults the program when it writes junk into the heap.
    //
    // https://github.com/arcnmx/stack-rs/blob/76cc1855a3ce966182bcf6fb2dc6a1d765cb5138/src/vector.rs#L51-L60
    let mut vec : ArrayVec<[u8; 2]> = ArrayVec::with_capacity(2);
    vec.insert(5, 0x41);

    // 2. The `array` in `ArrayVec` uses `std::mem::uninitialized`. While this
    //    isn't a big concern, seeing as only a few types are allowed to inhabit
    //    ArrayVec<T>, this should be replaced. See https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec/issues/126
}
```

Issue number 2 is pointed out in [#3](https://github.com/arcnmx/stack-rs/issues/3).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
