Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35769:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `miniserv.pl` in Webmin handles special characters within query arguments passed to CGI programs on Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of special characters in CGI program arguments on Windows.
- Specifically, characters like `<`, `>`, `|`, `&`, `^` are not properly escaped when passed in the query arguments, leading to potential command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the target system by injecting malicious commands through the vulnerable query arguments.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through network access.
- It involves crafting a specific request with malicious query arguments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges.
- No user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
- The attacker needs a network connection to the vulnerable Webmin instance.
- The attacker needs expert-level ability to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `handle_request` subroutine within `miniserv.pl`.
- The code flaw is in how arguments are processed when a CGI script (like a Perl script) is executed on Windows. The fix includes properly escaping special characters using `s/([<>|&"^])/^$1/g` before passing the arguments to the perl interpreter.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Windows systems because of the way command arguments are parsed in Windows when spawning a process.
- The provided code diff shows the fix applied to `miniserv.pl`.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8, highlighting its severe impact.
- The affected version is 1.962. Version 1.970 is patched.
