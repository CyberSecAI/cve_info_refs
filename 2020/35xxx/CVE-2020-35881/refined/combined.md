### Description

This crate gets the data pointer from fat pointers assuming that the first
element in a fat pointer is the data pointer. This is currently true, but
it may change in a future Rust version, leading to memory corruption.

This has been fixed in the master branch of the crate, but is has not
been released into crates.io.

## Description

![@eduardosm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761151?u=b89a78a03ae69431bc81302b89a86638fed0e197&v=4&size=48)[eduardosm](https://github.com/eduardosm)opened [on Jun 1, 2020](https://github.com/reem/rust-traitobject/issues/7#issue-628374673)

The implementation of the `data` and `data_mut` functions is highly unsafe:

[rust-traitobject/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/reem/rust-traitobject/blob/a8a36dc684e720b7f231d09ee3baebd53affd0b2/src/lib.rs#L13-L22)

Lines 13 to 22
in
[a8a36dc](/reem/rust-traitobject/commit/a8a36dc684e720b7f231d09ee3baebd53affd0b2)

|  | pub unsafe fn data<T: ?Sized>(val: \*const T) -> \*const () { |
| --- | --- |
|  | \*mem::transmute::<\*const \*const T, \*const \*const ()>(&val) |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | /// Get the data pointer from this trait object, mutably. |
|  | /// |
|  | /// Highly unsafe, as there is no information about the type of the data. |
|  | pub unsafe fn data\_mut<T: ?Sized>(mut val: \*mut T) -> \*mut () { |
|  | \*mem::transmute::<\*mut \*mut T, \*mut \*mut ()>(&mut val) |
|  | } |

This assumes that the first element is a fat pointer is the data pointer. This is currently true, but it can change in a newer rust version, which would make this crate a potential security hole.

Commit [99b1993](https://github.com/reem/rust-traitobject/commit/99b1993a13bf80e93031048586526384d1d8bddc) fixed this, but it has not been released into a new version. Please, publish a new version (0.1.1) that includes this commit (and possibly yank the previous versions).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
