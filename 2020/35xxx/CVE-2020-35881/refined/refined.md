Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35881:

**Root Cause:**

The `traitobject` crate incorrectly assumes the layout of fat pointers. Specifically, it assumes that the data pointer is always the first element in a fat pointer. This assumption, while currently true in Rust, is not guaranteed and might change in future versions, which would lead to incorrect pointer dereferences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Fat Pointer Layout Assumption:** The crate's `data` and `data_mut` functions directly access the data pointer by transmuting the fat pointer to a pointer to a pointer, assuming the first element is the data pointer.
*   **Memory Corruption:** If the fat pointer layout changes in future Rust versions, this assumption will become invalid, leading to out-of-bounds reads/writes and potential memory corruption.
*   **Unsoundness:** The code is marked as `unsafe` but makes assumptions that are not guaranteed by the Rust language, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary impact is potential memory corruption due to the incorrect pointer dereference, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or other security vulnerabilities.
*   **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** As the CVSS score indicates, the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attack vector is over the network, although the specific exploitation method would depend on how the vulnerable `traitobject` crate is used within a larger application.
*  **Low Attack Complexity**
*  **No Privileges Required**
*  **No User Interaction Required**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to influence the data passed to the vulnerable functions (`traitobject::data`, `traitobject::data_mut`).
*   No special privileges or user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability, suggesting that it could be exploited remotely in an application using the crate.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions `<= 0.1.0` of the `traitobject` crate.
*   A fix has been implemented in the master branch of the crate, but a new version containing the fix hasn't been released yet on crates.io.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-35881 and GHSA-j79j-cx3h-g27h.

In summary, the `traitobject` crate's unsafe handling of fat pointers makes it vulnerable to memory corruption if the Rust language's fat pointer representation changes, allowing an attacker to potentially cause serious security issues within an application using the affected crate.
