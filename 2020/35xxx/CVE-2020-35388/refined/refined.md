Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of restriction on the `nums` parameter within the `/index.php` endpoint specifically when handling the `gettotal` action. This parameter is used to retrieve specific data and display it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. Because the `nums` parameter isn't properly validated, an attacker can manipulate it to retrieve internal system data that would typically be hidden or protected.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `nums` parameter, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:**  An attacker can access internal application data, which might include sensitive information about system logs, user activities, configuration details, and more based on the provided screenshot of information being displayed. This can lead to a variety of further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `nums` parameter in the GET request to the `/index.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user to exploit this vulnerability as mentioned in the description "After the user logged in".
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to understand how to send HTTP GET requests and manipulate query parameters.
- **Application Awareness:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and the `nums` parameter's function to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional details:**

- The provided content also shows that the `ajaxbool` parameter can also be manipulated by an attacker to further impact the response of the vulnerable endpoint.
- The vulnerable code section is located in `/webmain/home/index/indexAction.php`.
- The vulnerable software is identified as xinhu OA V2.1.9.
- There is a suggested Proof of Concept (POC) in the content: `/index.php?a=gettotal&m=index&d=home&atype=&loadci=&optdt=&nums=gong,kqdk,apply,officic,syslog,about&ajaxbool=true`.
