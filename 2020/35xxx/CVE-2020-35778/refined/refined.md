The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in some of their Smart Managed Pro Switches.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The advisory indicates that a CSRF vulnerability exists in the web interface of specific NETGEAR switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability allows an attacker to induce a victim into performing unintended actions on the web interface of the affected NETGEAR switch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially make unauthorized configuration changes or perform administrative functions on the switch if a victim is logged into the switch's web interface while visiting a malicious webpage or clicking a malicious link.
- The advisory notes that the impact is "low", and states, "The cross site request forgery vulnerability remains if you do not complete all recommended steps." This suggests that the risk can be fully mitigated by updating firmware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out through a malicious website or link, which exploits the trust a browser has for the switch's web interface.
- A user must be authenticated to the switch's web interface at the time the attack occurs.
- The attacker has no direct access to the device, they exploit the user's access and authenticated session to the device through the CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or send a crafted link to a user who has access to a vulnerable NETGEAR switch.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting the malicious site or clicking the malicious link. The attack is successful if a user is logged into the switch's web interface during the time of the attack.

**Affected Products:**
- GS716Tv3, running firmware versions prior to 6.3.1.36
- GS724Tv4, running firmware versions prior to 6.3.1.36
