The content is related to CVE-2020-35911.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unsound implementations of the `Send` or `Sync` traits for certain lock guard objects in the `lock_api` crate. Specifically, `MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, and `RwLockWriteGuard` had incorrect trait implementations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect `Send` and `Sync` trait implementations allowed data races through types that are not safe to send across thread boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data races could occur in safe Rust code, leading to undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the use of affected lock guard types in multi-threaded code where data is shared between threads without proper synchronization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write Rust code using the affected `lock_api` crate and its vulnerable guard types in a multi-threaded environment. No special privileges are required.
