Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2020-35122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks and restrictions on SQL queries within the Keysight Database Connector plugin for Atlassian Confluence. Specifically, in versions prior to 1.5.0, users could potentially bypass intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Replacement Attack:**  A malicious user with write access to a Confluence page or space could modify existing database connection macros or insert new macros to send arbitrary SQL queries to a database, using a connection profile they were not authorized to access directly. 
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The plugin lacked adequate checks to ensure that only users authorized for a specific database connection profile could use that profile within a database macro. This allowed unauthorized users to potentially execute queries.
*   **Bypass of User-Based Authorization:** User-based authorization controls within the plugin were circumventable through Confluence REST API, enabling the creation of unauthorized macros using restricted profile IDs.
*   **Lack of Space-Based Restrictions:** Prior to version 1.5.0, there was no mechanism to limit the use of a database connection profile to specific Confluence spaces, which was a security flaw that resulted in unauthorized SQL execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries against the configured database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Data Breach:** If the database contained sensitive information, a successful attack could result in a data breach.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability could allow a user with write access on a page to gain access to a database with higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Page Editing:** An attacker with write access to a Confluence page or space could modify existing database macros or insert new ones.
*   **Confluence REST API:** The attacker could use the Confluence REST API to create a page with a database macro using a restricted profile ID, bypassing user-based restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have write permissions on a Confluence page or space containing a vulnerable macro or be able to create a page through the Confluence REST API.
*   The attacker needs to know the ID of a database connection profile.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL queries.
*   The attacker does not need to be authorized to use the database connection profile directly.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in version 1.5.0 and later, where the profile can be locked to particular spaces, limiting the ability to send unauthorized SQL queries.
*   Also, in 1.5.1, the "Authorized Spaces" was introduced, further enhancing security by restricting profile use to certain spaces.
