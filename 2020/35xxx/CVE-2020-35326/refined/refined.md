Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `WebsiteImagesMapper.xml` file of the inxedu project. Specifically, the `deleteImages` SQL query uses `${value}` which directly interpolates the input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Direct String Interpolation:** Using `${value}` directly in the SQL query allows for SQL injection.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in the SQL query.
*   **Lack of Parameterization:** The SQL query isn't using parameterized queries, which would prevent SQL injection.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, an attacker might be able to gain higher privileges within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker may be able to use SQL injection to cause a denial of service condition by causing database errors or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to specific endpoints such as `/admin/article/delete` or `/admin/website/delImages`.
*   **Manipulated input:** The `articelId` or `imageId` parameter is used to inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoints and parameters (e.g., `articelId` or `imageId`).
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP POST requests.
*   **Authentication:** In some cases, the attacker may need to be logged in as a user with administrative privileges or be able to bypass the authentication if that's also a vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable SQL query is in `WebsiteImagesMapper.xml`:
```xml
<delete id="deleteImages" parameterType="java.lang.String">
  DELETE FROM EDU_WEBSITE_IMAGES WHERE IMAGE_ID IN(${value})
</delete>
```
* The github content provides an example POST request:
```
POST /admin/article/delete HTTP/1.1
...
articelId=333 AND (SELECT 9875 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7178766b71,(SELECT (ELT(9875=9875,1))),version(),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)
```
* The gitee content provides a similar example:
```
POST /admin/website/delImages HTTP/1.1
...
imageId=320) or updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(user())),0) #
```
