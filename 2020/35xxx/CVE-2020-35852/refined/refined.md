Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of file upload restrictions in the Gist chatbox feature. Specifically, the application allows users to upload SVG and XML files without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user-uploaded files, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user session cookies.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** If combined with social engineering, attackers can trick users into revealing sensitive information.
*   **CSRF Attacks:** The vulnerability can be leveraged to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*   **Full User Compromise:** By controlling a script executed in the victim's browser, attackers can potentially:
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   View information the user has access to.
    *   Modify information the user can modify.
    *   Impersonate the user to interact with other application users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the chatbox's file upload feature.
*   **Malicious Files:** The attacker uploads specially crafted files (SVG, XML) containing XSS payloads.
*   **Payload Execution:** Whenever a user interacts with the uploaded file (likely by viewing the chat message containing the malicious file), the injected XSS script is executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Chatbox:** An attacker needs access to the Gist chatbox feature.
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker must be able to upload files.
*   **Crafted Payloads:** The attacker must be capable of creating XSS payloads within SVG or XML files.

**Mitigation:**

The provided document suggests several mitigation techniques, including:
*   **Input Filtering:** Filter user input strictly upon arrival based on what's expected or valid.
*   **Output Encoding:** Encode all user-controllable data upon output in HTTP responses to prevent them being interpreted as active content, considering HTML, URL, JavaScript and CSS contexts.
*   **Response Headers:** Use Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure browsers interpret responses correctly, preventing XSS in non-HTML/JavaScript intended responses.
*  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP as a final measure to reduce the impact of any XSS vulnerabilities that persist.

**Additional Notes**

*   The exploit detailed in the provided content specifically mentions using SVG or XML files with embedded JavaScript for the XSS payload.
*   The impact of the vulnerability is quite high, potentially allowing complete compromise of user accounts, sensitive data exposure, and further attacks.
