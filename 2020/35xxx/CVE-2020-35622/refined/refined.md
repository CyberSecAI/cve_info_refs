Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-controlled data (page titles) within the `SpecialGlobalUsage` extension of MediaWiki.
- Specifically, the `formatItem` function in `SpecialGlobalUsage.php` was not properly escaping page titles before outputting them to HTML.
- When a link could not be constructed for a given page title (using `WikiMap::makeForeignLink`), the raw page title was returned without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness was a reflected XSS vulnerability. If a page title contained malicious JavaScript or HTML, it would be executed in the context of the user's browser when the `SpecialGlobalUsage` page was viewed.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `formatItem` function was not properly escaping the page title before output, leaving it vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page titles displayed by the `SpecialGlobalUsage` extension.
- This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Steal user cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform actions on the user's behalf.
    - Deface the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating page titles in MediaWiki.
- By creating a page with a specially crafted title containing malicious code, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
- An attacker would require the ability to create or edit pages in a MediaWiki instance using the vulnerable extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the target MediaWiki instance and be able to create or edit pages.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious payloads within a page title.
- The attacker would need to entice a victim user to visit the vulnerable `SpecialGlobalUsage` page to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a potential issue and was later confirmed.
- The fix involved ensuring that the page title is always escaped using `htmlspecialchars()` before being returned by `formatItem()`.
- Initially, the fix incorrectly escaped the page title before passing it to  `WikiMap::makeForeignLink` causing double encoding when the link was created successfully. This was later corrected to only escape the value when `WikiMap::makeForeignLink` returns `false`.
- The vulnerability was present in the `GlobalUsage` extension across multiple branches of MediaWiki (REL1_31, REL1_35, and master).
- The task was initially security-protected and then later made public after the fix was deployed.
