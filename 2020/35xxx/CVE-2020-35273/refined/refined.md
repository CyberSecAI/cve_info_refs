{
  "root_cause": "The application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
  "impact": "An attacker can update any user's account, potentially taking it over. Additionally, due to Stored XSS vulnerability in the 'FULL NAME' field, an attacker can steal authenticated user sessions/cookies.",
  "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable application, tricking the authenticated user's browser into sending the request on the attacker's behalf.",
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to induce an authenticated user to access the malicious HTML page (e.g., via a link). The attacker also needs to know the structure and parameters of the vulnerable application's profile update request."
