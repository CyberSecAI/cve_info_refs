The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35758.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of authentication in the web interface of the Libre Wireless LS9 module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the LS9 web interface. All authenticated functions can be accessed without proper authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can directly access endpoints that should not be exposed to an unauthenticated user. This could potentially lead to a variety of malicious actions depending on what functionality is exposed via these endpoints. The specific impact of this CVE is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.3. The impact is limited to low Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent network access, meaning an attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending HTTP requests to the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the device and have the ability to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface (port 80). No user interaction is required.
