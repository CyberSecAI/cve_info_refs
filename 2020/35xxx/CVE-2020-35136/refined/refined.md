**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames in the `dol_sanitizeFileName` function. Specifically, the function did not prevent the use of the `--` sequence within filenames. This sequence can be interpreted as an option in command line environments, which can be exploited to inject malicious parameters or shell commands when filenames are processed by external commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Command injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution
- Privilege escalation
- System compromise

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted filename that includes `--` followed by injected commands.
- Exploitation of functionalities where a filename is used by a shell command or similar.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload or specify file names on the system.
- Knowledge of system's shell or command execution logic.

**Additional Information:**
- The patch includes adding `--` to the list of forbidden characters in the `dol_sanitizeFileName` function, along with related unit tests.
- The commit message specifically mentions the vulnerability was reported by Yılmaz Değirmenci.
- A related comment suggests that the code should use prepared statements.
