Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Amaze File Manager application's built-in FTP server could be controlled by any other application on the same device. This was possible because the intents used to start and stop the FTP server were not restricted, meaning any application could send these intents and control the server without user consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unprotected Intent:** The application used implicit intents with actions `com.amaze.filemanager.services.ftpservice.FTPReceiver.ACTION_START_FTPSERVER` and `com.amaze.filemanager.services.ftpservice.FTPReceiver.ACTION_STOP_FTPSERVER` to control the FTP server. These intents were not protected by a custom permission.
- **Lack of Access Control:** Any application installed on the same device could send these intents without requiring any specific permissions, leading to a lack of access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized FTP Server Control:** A malicious application could start or stop the FTP server on the Amaze File Manager without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Data Exposure:** If the FTP server is started without user awareness, a malicious application can potentially gain access to files stored on the device via the FTP server.
- **Denial of Service:**  A malicious application could repeatedly stop and start the FTP server, causing a denial-of-service.
- **User annoyance:** Users might experience their FTP server being toggled without knowing why, which could be considered disruptive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the same Android device as Amaze File Manager is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Install Apps:** The attacker needs to be able to install a malicious application on the user's Android device.
- **Android Programming Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to send Android intents with the specified action strings to control the Amaze File Manager FTP server.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed by introducing a custom permission `com.amaze.filemanager.permission.CONTROL_FTP_SERVER` and requiring that only applications holding this signature-level permission could send intents to start or stop the FTP server. This effectively restricts control to Amaze File Manager itself, or apps signed by the same developer.

**Additional Notes:**
The github content shows a discussion about if the `protectionLevel` should be set to `signature` or `dangerous`, they ultimately opted for signature to make sure no other app can control the ftp service, even if the user grants them the permission.
The discussion also mentions issues that arose with Android O's implicit broadcast ban.
