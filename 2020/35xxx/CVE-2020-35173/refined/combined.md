### @TranceLove **[TranceLove](/TranceLove)** commented [Jan 10, 2020](#issue-547918794)

Per mail discussion offline it is found that any app may fire an Intent with action com.amaze.filemanager.services.ftpservice.FTPReceiver.ACTION\_START\_FTPSERVER or com.amaze.filemanager.services.ftpservice.FTPReceiver.ACTION\_STOP\_FTPSERVER to control Amaze's built-in FTP server without user acknowledgement.

Changes in changeset

* add a custom permission com.amaze.filemanager.permission.CONTROL\_FTP\_SERVER and set it at signature level
* FtpService requires com.amaze.filemanager.permission.CONTROL\_FTP\_SERVER permission
* so only Amaze would be able to send intents to start/stop the FTP server

This supercedes [#1814](https://github.com/TeamAmaze/AmazeFileManager/pull/1814) which contained unfinished code that makes the PR difficult to understand. Its work (to work out a way to allow third-party apps to start/stop Amaze's FTP server) will continue on another PR.

Sorry, something went wrong.

protectionLevel="signature" is a bit much isn't it?

Seems `dangerous` can still prevent unintended intents sent to `FtpReceiver`.

December 22, 2024Recursive copy and paste does not work in this product. This product is a complete waste of time for me. If I try to copy a folder with files and subfolders, it reports that it's going to copy one folder and 0 files. If I issue a paste in the destination, nothing happens. The only way I can copy folders in their files is to create the folder manually at the destination and then copy the files into it from the source. A complete waste of time.1 person found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWhFgjWo_scM8Y88-PpdN72UPBpS2QNH6zl_ZdOY9TlI22yYLu2=s32-rw)Joel marko*more\_vert*

August 15, 2024This is definitely one of the best file managers I've experienced so far, with it's built in extractor for .zip, .rar, and more filetypes, and it's easy text editor. The one thing that annoys me is the two seperate tabs, and I don't seem to see an option to keep only 1 tab to not accidently swipe from tabs each time. Hopefully this gets added soon, this file manager to me seems better than the rest.4 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXTqlStHy8USFyr03WU95QjeYyK0bF9HNSUAbdbmz8SucJRbBtj=s32-rw)M S*more\_vert*

November 12, 2021Very impressive UX/UI. No cruft, no bloat. I do have suggestions: 1) My fat fingers have difficulty hitting the options icon next to files and folders in list view. Often, I open a file when I intended to rename it. Can this button have a larger active area? 2) Navigating to a parent folder is currently a hunt-and-peck process within the address, requiring moving my finger according to the length of the folder name. A permanent Up button would be preferable. 3) An option to disable animations.45 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
