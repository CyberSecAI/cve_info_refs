Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35514:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from overly permissive file permissions on `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` on OpenShift nodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` file has permissions that allow unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can obtain the kubeconfig file, potentially exposing cluster configuration details.
*   **Integrity Violation:**  Attackers could potentially add a rogue node to the cluster.
*   **System Availability:** The unauthorized addition of a rogue node could impact the overall stability and availability of the OpenShift cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Compromised Container:** An attacker with access to a running container that mounts the `/etc/kubernetes` directory can access the vulnerable file.
*   **Local Node Access:** An attacker with local access to the node can also access the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have either access to a running container with the `/etc/kubernetes` directory mounted or direct local access to the OpenShift node.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The kubeconfig file contains bootstrap credentials, which have a short validity period (24 hours). After this period, the credentials become invalid.
*   The certificate signing request (CSR) of a joining rogue node is not automatically approved. The attacker would still need to approve the node using `oc get csr` and `oc adm certificate approve` commands.
