The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35820.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the vulnerable device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected device's web interface. This could potentially allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal session cookies, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected NETGEAR routers and WiFi systems. An attacker injects malicious scripts that are stored by the device and executed when a user interacts with that stored data via the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into the affected device's web interface.  The CVSS vector indicates the attacker must have high privileges on the local network `(AV:A/AC:L/PR:H)`.
