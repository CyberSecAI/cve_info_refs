{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the Pure-FTPd server's limitation on the number of connections it can handle. By repeatedly making new connections, an attacker can exhaust the server's resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a lack of proper connection management and rate limiting leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the FTP server. This can disrupt services and impact availability.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, leveraging the FTP protocol to initiate connections to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish connections to the FTP server, and no special privileges are required. They need network access to the target server."
