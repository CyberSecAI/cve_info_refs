```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PushToWatch extension form lacked an edit token, making it susceptible to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The form in the PushToWatch extension did not include a security token (edit token), allowing an attacker to potentially submit requests on behalf of a user without their consent.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could add arbitrary users to a watchlist on behalf of the victim without their knowledge or consent.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious website or email could contain a crafted form that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the PushToWatch extension.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted POST request to the vulnerable form. This can be achieved through various means, such as embedding the malicious request in an iframe on a webpage, sending a phishing email with a malicious link etc. The attacker does not need to have any specific account privileges on the wiki."
