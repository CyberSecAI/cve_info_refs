- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsound implementations of the `Send` or `Sync` traits for certain lock guard objects in the `lock_api` crate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, and `RwLockWriteGuard` structs incorrectly implemented the `Send` or `Sync` traits. These incorrect trait implementations allowed these types to be moved across threads, potentially leading to data races when the underlying data was not thread-safe.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Data races could occur, leading to memory corruption or undefined behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through misuse of the affected guard objects, by sending them to different threads where they are not thread safe, leading to data races.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to use the affected lock guard objects in a multi-threaded context, potentially through a library that uses the affected `lock_api` crate.
