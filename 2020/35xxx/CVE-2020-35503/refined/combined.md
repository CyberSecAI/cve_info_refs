| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1910346#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-23 14:32:23 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference issue was found in the megasas-gen2 SCSI host bus adapter emulation of QEMU. It could occur in the megasas_command_cancelled() callback function in hw/scsi/megasas.c while dropping a SCSI request. A privileged guest user may exploit this issue to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1910346#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-23 14:32:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Cheolwoo Myung   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1910346#c2)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-23 15:42:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenStack Platform and RHEL Advanced Virtualization, as the `qemu-kvm` package does not include support for the megasas-gen2 host bus adapter emulation.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1910346#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-23 15:43:06 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1910366](show_bug.cgi?id=1910366 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-35503 qemu: NULL pointer dereference issue in megasas-gen2 host bus adapter [fedora-all]")]   Created xen tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1910367](show_bug.cgi?id=1910367 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-35503 xen: QEMU: NULL pointer dereference issue in megasas-gen2 host bus adapter [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
