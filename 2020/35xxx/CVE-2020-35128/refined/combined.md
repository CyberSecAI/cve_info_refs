# Mautic Version <=3.2.2 Advisory

By:
[Dardan Prebreza, Senior Security Consultant](https://bishopfox.com/authors/dardan-prebreza)

![Gauge reading medium severity. Mautic Version <=3.2.2 Advisory.](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/tiles/Medium-Risk-Advisory-Featured.jpg)

Share

## **ADVISORY SUMMARY**

The Mautic application is affected by stored XSS vulnerabilities. Upon exploitation, these issues allow an authenticated attacker to store malicious JavaScript payloads that would execute against other Mautic users. Specifically, an attacker with the permissions to manage companies or Social Monitoring, an application feature, could attack other users, including administrators. For example, by loading an externally crafted JavaScript file, an attacker could eventually perform actions as the target user. These actions include changing the user passwords, altering user or email addresses, or adding a new administrator to the system.

## Impact

An authenticated attacker with the permissions to manage companies or Social Monitoring could target and perform actions on the behalf of other users, including administrators.

## Risk Level

Medium

## Affected Vendor

| **Product Vendor** | Product Name | Affected Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mautic | Mautic | <= 3.2.2 |

## Product Description

Mautic is an open source marketing automation tool. The project’s official website is <https://www.mautic.org/>. The latest version of the application is 3.2.4 released on January 14, 2021.

## Vulnerabilities List

One vulnerability was identified within the Mautic application:

**[CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)](#CI)**

## Solution

Update to version 3.2.4

## **VULNERABILITIES**

## CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)

The Mautic application is affected by stored XSS vulnerabilities. These issues allow an authenticated attacker to store malicious JavaScript payloads that would execute against other Mautic users. Specifically, an attacker with the permissions to manage companies or Social Monitoring could attack other users, including administrators. For instance, by loading an externally crafted JavaScript file, an attacker could eventually perform actions on behalf of the target user, including changing the user’s password or email address or adding a new administrator to the system.

| **CVE ID** | **Security Risk** | **Impact** | **Access Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2020-35128](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35128),[CVE-2020-35129](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35129) | Medium | Escalation of privileges | Remote |

### Stored XSS in Company Name Field

A stored XSS vulnerability was found in the `Company Name` field. To demonstrate this issue, a proof-of-concept (PoC) payload was injected into that field:

***![Company Name with JavaScript payload](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/Mautic%20Fig%201.png)***

******Figure 1** -*** **Company name**with JavaScript *payload**

As shown in the following POST request, the XSS payload was used in the `company[companyname]` parameter:

```
POST /mautic/s/companies/edit/1?mauticUserLastActive=4764&mauticLastNotificationId= HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
…omitted for brevity…
company%5Bscore%5D=0&company%5Bowner%5D=&company%5Bcompanyname%5D=%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dconfirm('XSS')%3E&company%5Bcompanyemail%5D=&company%5Bcompanyaddress1%5D=&company%5Bcompanyaddress2%5D=&company%5Bcompanycity%5D=&company%5Bcompanystate%5D=&company%5Bcompanyzipcode%5D=&company%5Bcompanycountry%5D=&company%5Bcompanyphone%5D=&company%5Bcompanywebsite%5D=&company%5Bcompanynumber_of_employees%5D=&company%5Bcompanyfax%5D=&company%5Bcompanyannual_revenue%5D=&company%5Bcompanyindustry%5D=&company%5Bcompanydescription%5D=&company%5B_token%5D=kAayMpWGSe_npJC64UDzpgtMHDeFLGx4CAptt1mDzH8&company%5Bbuttons%5D%5Bsave%5D=
```

***Figure 2** - Affected parameter in POST request*

As soon as the change was saved, the XSS triggered:

***![Triggered XSS after creating or editing company](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/Mautic%20Fig%203.png)***

***Figure 3** -**Triggered XSS after creating or editing company*

Additionally, this XSS triggered on several locations. For example, the default Dashboard had a Recent Activity widget that retrieved all recent activities. As a result, when the company with a malicious JavaScript code was added, it appeared on the Dashboard:

![Triggered XSS on Dashboard page](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/Mautic%20Fig%204.png)

***Figure 4** - Triggered XSS on Dashboard page*

The company with the XSS payload could also be selected when adding a new contact:

![Selecting malicious company while creating or editing a contact](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/Mautic%20Fig%205.png)

******Figure 5**** **-** Selecting malicious company while creating or editing a contact**

When the contact was added or viewed, the XSS triggered:

![Triggered XSS while viewing a contact](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/Mautic%20Fig%206.png)

******Figure 6**** **-** Triggered XSS while viewing a contact**

The default Mautic installation featured a single user role that had full administrative access; however, it was possible to create less-privileged user roles. If a less-privileged user role had access only to create companies, that user could inject an XSS payload to perform actions on behalf of those users.

### Stored XSS in Social Monitoring Title or Name

A stored XSS issue was also discovered within the Social Monitoring section. Specifically, an attacker could enter a malicious JavaScript payload in the `Name` or `Title` of the Social Monitor feature, as shown below:

![Social Monitor Name allowing XSS payloads](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/Mautic%20Fig%207.png)

******Figure 7**** **-** Social Monitor Name allowing XSS payloads**

The following HTTP POST request was used to store the XSS payload:

```
POST /mautic/s/monitoring/edit/1?mauticUserLastActive=180&mauticLastNotificationId= HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
…omitted for brevity…
monitoring%5Btitle%5D=AAA%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dconfirm(1)%3E&monitoring%5BnetworkType%5D=twitter_handle&monitoring%5Bproperties%5D%5Bhandle%5D=bishopfox&monitoring%5Bproperties%5D%5Bchecknames%5D=0&monitoring%5Bdescription%5D=Test&monitoring%5BisPublished%5D=1&monitoring%5BpublishUp%5D=&monitoring%5BpublishDown%5D=&monitoring%5Bcategory%5D=&monitoring%5B_token%5D=4eSQ1YrFcdj3xdVfIcXiDQBkKnpSZa8dLZ1az8_YVWU&monitoring%5Bbuttons%5D%5Bsave%5D=

```

******Figure 8**** **-** POST request with XSS payload in the* `monitoring[title]` *parameter**

The XSS payload was evaluated as soon as the modified Social Monitor was viewed:

***![Triggered XSS after opening Social Monitor](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/Mautic%20Fig%209.png)***

******Figure 9**** **-** Triggered XSS after opening Social Monitor**

As with the previous XSS instance affecting company names, even if a user role had access only to Social Monitoring, that user could eventually attack other Mautic users, including administrators, by injecting malicious payloads. For instance, an attacker could load an externally drafted JavaScript file that would allow them to eventually perform actions on the target user’s behalf, including changing the user’s password or email address or changing the attacker’s user role from a low-privileged user to an administrator account.

We have made available for immediate download an out-of-sequence release for both Mautic 2.x and 3.x.

## :warning: Important note for users who are currently running 3.2.0 or later

Are you currently using Mautic 3.2.0 or later **and do you update through the CLI (Command Line Interface)**? Then the message below applies to you! This **does not apply** if you’re updating through the UI (graphical interface).

When you’re trying to update through the CLI, you might run into the following error:

```
Notice: Undefined index: message in /var/www/html/app/bundles/CoreBundle/Update/Step/InstallNewFilesStep.php on line 131

Failed to execute command php bin/console mautic:update:apply: exit status 1

```

This bug was introduced in Mautic 3.2.0 and fixed in 3.2.4. Please use the following workaround:

```
wget https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/download/3.2.4/3.2.4-update.zip
php bin/console mautic:update:apply --update-package=3.2.4-update.zip
php bin/console mautic:update:apply --finish

```

We have also published some resources on the website:

* [Landing page for the security team](https://www.mautic.org/mautic-security-team)
* [Security Advisory Policy](https://www.mautic.org/mautic-security-team/mautic-security-advisory-policy)
* [How to report a security issue](https://www.mautic.org/mautic-security-team/how-to-report-a-security-issue)
* [How we triage, resolve and release fixes for security issues](https://www.mautic.org/mautic-security-team/triaging-and-resolving-security-issues)
* [How to join the Mautic Security Team](https://www.mautic.org/mautic-security-team/join-the-team)
* [Meet the Mautic Security Team](https://www.mautic.org/meet-the-mautic-security-team)

This release addresses:

1. A **Moderately Critical** Vulnerability (Vulnerability 1) reported by Dardan Prebreza at Bishop Fox, and
2. A **Highly Critical** Vulnerability (Vulnerability 2) reported by Naveen Sunkavally at Horizon3.ai.

### Risk Ratings

These are based on the information in the ‘[how we triage, resolve and release fixes for security issues](https://www.mautic.org/mautic-security-team/triaging-and-resolving-security-issues)’ page above.

#### Vulnerability 1

12/25 (**Moderately Critical**) AC:Complex/A:Admin/CI:Some/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:All

#### Vulnerability 2

22/25 (**Highly Critical**) AC:None/A:None/CI:All/II:All/E:Theoretical/TD:All

As Vulnerability 2 affects **every released version** of Mautic and allows an attacker to create a user in Mautic with elevated privileges, all users are **strongly urged** to update immediately.

More information can be found in the CVE reports here - details will be added following the release:

### Vulnerability 1

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3142>

### Vulnerability 2

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35124>

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35125>

### Patches

The easiest way to protect your Mautic instances is to simply update to 2.16.5 or 3.2.3 in the usual way. If you are unable to do this for any reason, the patch files are provided below.

#### Fix for both vulnerabilities

Link to patch for 2.x versions: <https://github.com/mautic/mautic/compare/2.16.4...2.16.5.diff>

Link to patch for 3.x versions: <https://github.com/mautic/mautic/compare/3.2.2...3.2.3.diff>

## How to scan for attempts to exploit the vulnerability

We have also provided some searches that you can do to see if there have been attempts to exploit the highly critical vulnerability.

### Check for exploit attempts - Vulnerability 1

To see if there was an attempt at this vulnerability, run the following queries replacing PREFIX\_ with your own if configured:

* >select \* from PREFIX\_companies where companyname like '%<%' or companyname like '%onerror%';

### Check for exploit attempts - Vulnerability 2

The first and absolutely necessary step is to check if there are any unrecognized users listed in Mautic’s User manager. Delete or unpublish any not recognized immediately.

To see if there was an attempt at this vulnerability, run the following queries replacing PREFIX\_ with your own if configured:

* >select \* from PREFIX\_form\_submissions where referer like '%<%' or referer like '%onerror%';
* >select \* from PREFIX\_asset\_downloads where referer like '%<%' or referer like '%onerror%';
* >select \* from PREFIX\_companies where companyname like '%<%' or companyname like '%onerror%';

If there are any results returned, review them to look for HTML tags. If it looks like HTML is embedded, delete the entry from the database.
