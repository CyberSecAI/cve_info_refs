Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-35296:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the usage of default credentials ("admin" for both username and password) for the administrator login in ThinkAdmin version 6.0. This lack of proper credential management allows unauthorized access to the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Default Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of easily guessable default login credentials.
- **Lack of Password Complexity Enforcement:** There's no indication that the system enforces any password complexity requirements or mandates users to change the default password upon initial login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain full access to the administrator dashboard.
- **Data Breach:** Once logged in, the attacker can view sensitive details of all users stored in the system.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker could potentially modify user accounts, system configurations, or deploy malicious code, leading to a full compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** An attacker directly visits the admin login page (`/admin/login.html`).
- **Credential Guessing:** The attacker uses the default credentials (`admin`/`admin`) to log in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application where ThinkAdmin is running.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know (or guess) that the default login credentials are `admin`/`admin`.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content includes a reference to ThinkAdmin v6, which is not the same as the vulnerable version (v6.0) and contains various security improvements including but not limited to CORS, XSS prevention and improved upload validations.
