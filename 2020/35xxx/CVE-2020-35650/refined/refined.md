Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in several POST and GET parameters within the Uncanny Groups for LearnDash plugin. This allows attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:** The plugin is vulnerable to multiple XSS attacks due to the lack of sanitization of user input. This includes both reflected XSS via GET parameters and stored XSS via POST parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, or other data from the userâ€™s browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves manipulating specific POST and GET parameters when interacting with the Uncanny Groups for LearnDash plugin. This means an attacker needs to craft malicious input in one of these parameters and have a victim access the vulnerable page.
    *   **POST Parameters (Stored XSS):**
        *   `ulgm_code_redeem` in `user-code-redemption.php`
        *   `ulgm_user_first` in `user-registration-form.php`
        *  `ulgm_user_last` in `user-registration-form.php`
        *   `ulgm_user_email` in `user-registration-form.php`
        *  `ulgm_code_registration` in `user-registration-form.php`
        *  `ulgm_terms_conditions` in `user-registration-form.php`
        * `_ulgm_total_seats` in `frontend-uo_groups_buy_courses.php`
         *   `uncanny_group_signup_user_first` in `group-registration-form.php`
        *   `uncanny_group_signup_user_last` in `group-registration-form.php`
        *   `uncanny_group_signup_user_login` in `group-registration-form.php`
        *   `uncanny_group_signup_user_email` in `group-registration-form.php`
    *   **GET Parameters (Reflected XSS):**
        *  `success-invited` in `frontend-uo_groups.php`
        *   `bulk-errors` in `frontend-uo_groups.php`
        *   `message` in `frontend-uo_groups.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. This means they need to have an account on the site, but not necessarily any admin privileges or specific plugin access.
*   **Access to Plugin:** The attacker must be able to navigate to the specific pages in the Uncanny Groups for LearnDash plugin that contain the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Uncanny Groups for LearnDash versions prior to 3.7 are affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability was patched in version 3.7 of the plugin.
*   **Disclosure Timeline:**
    *   The vulnerability was reported on 28/02/2020.
    *   It was patched on 08/06/2020.
    *   The CVE was registered on 22/12/2020.
    *   The public disclosure was on 23/12/2020.
