Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2506-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>
December 23, 2020                             <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : awstats
Version        : 7.6+dfsg-1+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-29600 CVE-2020-35176
Debian Bug     : 891469 977190

It was discovered that Awstats, a web server log analyzer, was
vulnerable to path traversal attacks. A remote unauthenticated
attacker could leverage that to perform arbitrary code execution. The
previous fix did not fully address the issue when the default
/etc/awstats/awstats.conf is not present.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
7.6+dfsg-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your awstats packages.

For the detailed security status of awstats please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/awstats>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Fedora’s Mission and Foundations

How do I get the software?

[![Get Fedora](_images/banner-getfedora_sq.png "fedoraproject.org")](https://fedoraproject.org/)

Download one of the different editions of Fedora for your laptop/desktop,
server, or containers at [Get Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org), or explore other
options provided by [Labs](https://fedoraproject.org/labs/),
[Spins](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/),
[ARM](https://arm.fedoraproject.org/), and
[Alternative Downloads](https://alt.fedoraproject.org/).

Everything included is open source and free software â not only is it
available at no cost to you, but you can share, remix, and modify.

## What is Fedora?

The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a
free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share
user-focused solutions built on that platform. Or, in plain English, we
make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff
with it.

## What is Fedora all about?

The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different
views and approaches, but together we share some common values.
We call these the â**Four Foundations**â: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.

| Freedom Four Foundations: Freedom   We are dedicated to free software and content.   Advancing software and content freedom is a central community goal, which we accomplish through the software and content we promote. We choose free alternatives to proprietary code and content and limit the effects of proprietary or patent encumbered code on the Project.   Sometimes this goal prevents us from taking the easy way out by including proprietary or patent encumbered software in Fedora. But by concentrating on the free software and content we provide and promote, the end result is that we are able to provide:   * releases that are predictable and 100% legally redistributable for everyone; * innovation in free and open source software that can equal or exceed closed source or proprietary solutions; * and, a completely free project that anyone can emulate or copy in whole or in part for their own purposes. | Friends Four Foundations: Friends   We are a strong, caring community.   photo friends   The Fedora community is made up of people from all walks of life, working together to advance free software. There is a place in Fedora for [anyone who wants to help](https://whatcanidoforfedora.org/), regardless of technical skill level, as long as they believe in our core values.   Like any friends, we occasionally disagree on details, but we believe in finding an acceptable consensus to serve the interests of advancing free software. We believe in a strong partnership between Red Hat and our enormous volunteer community, since they both provide essential contributions that help the Fedora Project succeed. |
| --- | --- |
| divider bottom freedom | divider bottom friends |
| Features Four Foundations: Features   We care about excellent software.   The Fedora community creates many of the technical features that have made Linux powerful, flexible, and usable for a wide spectrum of millions of users, administrators, and developers worldwide. We recognize the status quo is worth changing to empower additional end-users, or to create a more flexible and powerful environment for building new solutions on the free software we provide.   We also believe that these changes are best developed in direct concert with the [upstream software communities](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Staying_Close_to_Upstream_Projects/) whose work is part of the Fedora distribution. We work with the upstream in cases where we find opportunities for improvement, so all free software users benefit â even if they donât use Fedora directly. Our feature development is always done openly and transparently, and anyone may participate. | First Four Foundations: First   We are committed to innovation.   We are not content to let others do all the heavy lifting on our behalf; we provide the latest in stable and robust, useful, and powerful free software in our Fedora distribution.   At any point in time, the latest Fedora platform shows the future direction of the operating system as it is experienced by everyone from the home desktop user to the enterprise business customer. Our [rapid release cycle](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases) is a major enabling factor in our ability to innovate.   We recognize that there is also a place for long-term stability in the Linux ecosystem, and that there are a variety of community-oriented and business-oriented Linux distributions available to serve that need. However, the Fedora Project’s goal of advancing free software dictates that the Fedora Project itself pursue a strategy that preserves the forward momentum of our technical, collateral, and community-building progress. Fedora always aims to provide the future, first. |

## Our Vision

> *The Fedora Project envisions a world where everyone benefits from free and open source software built by inclusive, welcoming, and open-minded communities.*

As a project, we want everyone to live in a universe of free and open source software; the user should be in control of their computing.
But itâs not enough that the software is there, waiting to be used.
It has to be accessible and usable.
This vision also reflects our community approach â the Friends foundation.
Fedora isnât bits and bytes.
Fedora is our people, and we want the statement to include our vision of a healthy community.

## Our Mission

> *Fedora creates an innovative platform for hardware, clouds, and
> containers that enables software developers and community members to
> build tailored solutions for their users.*

At the operating system level, we donât just integrate. We do new things
â we build a *platform*, not just a distribution. The *Features* and
*First* foundations drive us to innovate. We do all of this as a
transparent, collaborative community of *Friends*, and entirely as open
source and free software â *Freedom*.

## Our Method

The Fedora Project is a center for innovation in free and open source
software. In our community, contributors of all kinds come together to
advance the ecosystem for the benefit of everyone. The Fedora community
contributes everything it builds back to the free and open source world
and continues to make advances of significance to the broader community,
as evidenced by the regular and rapid incorporation of its features into
other Linux distributions. Regardless of which Linux distribution you
use, you are relying on code developed within the Fedora Project.

We believe software patents
are harmful, a hindrance to innovation in software development, and are
inconsistent with the values of free and open source software. While tightly
integrating proprietary and patent encumbered components might superficially
improve ease of use, this practice does not benefit the community in the
long run. The Fedora community prefers approaches that benefit the progress
of free software in the future over those that emphasize short term ease of
use.

## Our Community

Fedora is more than just software. It is a community of contributors
from [around the world](https://fedoracommunity.org/), including volunteers
and Red Hat employees, who work with each other to advance the interests
of the free culture movement. Everyone is invited to join. No matter
what your skills are, we have a place for you in our community! We are
[software engineers](../package-maintainers/),
[designers and artists](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design),
[system administrators](../infra/),
[web designers](../websites/),
[writers](../fedora-docs/),
[speakers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors),
[translators](../localization/), and more â and we are happy to help you get
started.

We believe that all contributors should
[be excellent to each other](https://fedoraproject.org/code-of-conduct).
By creating an environment for constructive contribution, we can more
effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to
find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size,
diversity, and strength of our community.

## Leadership and Governance

The [Fedora Council](../council/) is responsible for
stewardship of the Fedora Project as a whole and supports the health and
growth of the Fedora Community. As in any large project, there are many
different levels of responsibility, accountability, and decision-making. As
a general rule, we want people working on a Fedora
[subproject](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Subprojects) to make meaningful decisions about their
areas of interest and expertise. More details are available on our page on
[Fedora Leadership](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Leadership).

## Description

![@Beuc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980977?u=ebd1a7b491cae0a6c408db9296b6739bd5c423ad&v=4&size=48)[Beuc](https://github.com/Beuc)opened [on Dec 9, 2020](https://github.com/eldy/AWStats/issues/195#issue-760387334)

Hi,

It seems [#90](https://github.com/eldy/AWStats/issues/90) is not completely fixed in 7.8.

(that is, even after [CVE-2017-1000501](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ph65-4f3r-7fv8 "CVE-2017-1000501") and [CVE-2020-29600](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-43g3-5cf8-2gm2 "CVE-2020-29600") are fixed)

Altering slightly the original example:

<http://myserver.example.com/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=/etc/passwd>

to e.g.:

<http://myserver.example.com/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=passwd>

```
Warning: Syntax error line 1 in file '/etc/passwd'. Config line is ignored.
Warning: Syntax error line 2 in file '/etc/passwd'. Config line is ignored.
Warning: Syntax error line 3 in file '/etc/passwd'. Config line is ignored.

```

```

it is still parsing /etc/\*.

I'd expect it to only allow files within /etc/awstats/awstats\*.conf.

Like [#90](https://github.com/eldy/AWStats/issues/90) this requires that /etc/awstats/awstats.conf does not exist (e.g. in multi-hosting environments with no default config).

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
