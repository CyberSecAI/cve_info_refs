Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a path traversal flaw in the `awstats.pl` script of AWStats. The script incorrectly handles the `config` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify a path to a configuration file outside of the intended `/etc/awstats/` directory. This was due to an incomplete fix for previous path traversal vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-1000501 and CVE-2020-29600). Specifically, even after the previous fixes, providing a partial path (e.g., `passwd` instead of `/etc/awstats/awstats.conf`) still allows the script to read files from `/etc` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the path traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to access files outside the intended configuration directory. This is a direct result of insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `config` parameter.
- **Incomplete Fix:** The vulnerability is present due to an incomplete fix of previous path traversal issues. This indicates a failure in thoroughly addressing the root cause of the problem, and not just the immediate exploitation vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, the Debian advisory mentions that an attacker could leverage the path traversal to achieve arbitrary code execution. It can be inferred that by reading files from `/etc`, an attacker might be able to read sensitive information and potentially inject malicious content into a file subsequently used by the application or system, leading to code execution.
- **Information Disclosure:** At a minimum, the vulnerability enables an attacker to read the content of files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information, configuration details, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The primary attack vector is the `config` parameter in the URL of the `awstats.pl` script. By crafting a malicious URL with a path traversal payload in the `config` parameter, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely and does not need prior authentication to the system.
- **Web Server Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a web server that hosts the vulnerable AWStats installation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the default `/etc/awstats/awstats.conf` file is not present. This suggests that the vulnerability may be more prevalent in multi-hosting environments or setups where the default configuration is not used.
- The vulnerability is a regression, meaning that a previous fix was ineffective.

In summary, CVE-2020-35176 represents a significant security risk as it allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code through a path traversal vulnerability. This risk is compounded by the fact that this vulnerability was a regression due to an incomplete fix to address previous similar issues.
