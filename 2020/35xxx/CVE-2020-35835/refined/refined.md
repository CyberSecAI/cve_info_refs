This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The document does not specify the exact root cause of the XSS vulnerability but refers to stored cross-site scripting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Information theft
    - Website defacement
    - Other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning that the malicious script is stored on the server (router) and executed when a user accesses the affected page. 
- It is implied that a user with administrative access would need to insert the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code through a vulnerable interface on the router.
- The advisory states a user with "high" privileges is needed (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
