The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35827. It describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in several NETGEAR router and WiFi system models. Although this advisory doesn't explicitly state which field is vulnerable, it does provide crucial details about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the affected device. When a user interacts with the affected page, the injected script will execute within the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user on the vulnerable device.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable field/parameter. This code is stored on the device. When a user with access to the administrative interface visits a page where this injected code is rendered, the script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the router's interface to inject the malicious script or find a method to inject it to the device.

The advisory lists the affected product models and the firmware versions that are vulnerable. It also provides instructions on how to download and install the latest firmware to mitigate the vulnerability. The CVSS v3 score of 6.1 indicates a medium severity vulnerability.
