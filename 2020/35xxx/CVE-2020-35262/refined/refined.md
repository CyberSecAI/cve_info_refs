  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerable endpoints in the Digisol DG-HR3400 Router lack server-side input validation and client-side filtering for malicious script injections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Missing server-side input validation",
      "Lack of client-side filtering"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts, which will be executed every time a user accesses the vulnerable endpoint. This can lead to device takeover and network compromise.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack is performed by injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable parameters within the router's web interface. The two identified vulnerable parameters are 'Server' in the NTP configuration within the Maintenance module, and 'Keyword' in the URL Blocking configuration within the Advanced module.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the Digisol DG-HR3400 Router to inject the malicious script."
