The provided content is a security advisory for a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and WiFi system models. This advisory is related to the vulnerability but not associated with the specified CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface. These scripts are then stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the browsers of users who access the administrative interface, leading to actions being performed in their name.  The advisory doesn't specify the full impact of the exploit, but the CVSS v3 rating indicates high confidentiality and integrity impact but no availability impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the administrative interface of affected NETGEAR devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, likely by exploiting a flaw within the administrative functionality, and needs to have authenticated access to the administration page. The advisory indicates that the attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H).

**Affected Devices and Firmware Versions:**

The advisory lists the following affected devices and firmware versions:
* D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
* R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
* R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.74
* R8900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
* R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
* RAX120, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78
* RBK20, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
* RBR20, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
* RBS20, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
* RBK40, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
* RBR40, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
* RBS40, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
* RBK50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
* RBR50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
* RBS50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
* XR500, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.56
* XR700, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.10

**CVSS v3 Rating:**
* **Score:** 6.1
* **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
   * AV:A (Adjacent Network) - Attack vector is within the same Layer 2 network
   * AC:L (Low) - Attack complexity is low
   * PR:H (High) - Requires high privileges
   * UI:N (None) - User interaction is not required
   * S:U (Unchanged) - Scope is unchanged
   * C:H (High) - Confidentiality impact is high
   * I:H (High) - Integrity impact is high
   * A:N (None) - Availability impact is none

**Mitigation:**
- The advisory recommends that users download the latest firmware for their respective devices.
