{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A limitation in the OVS packet parsing in userspace.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The OVS packet parsing logic in userspace does not handle packets with excessive Ethernet padding correctly.",
      "Specifically, when the padding length exceeds 255 bytes, the packet parsing aborts prematurely, ignoring header fields from layers 3 and 4."
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted packet with excessive padding can cause the packet lookup to use an unexpected set of header fields, leading to either matching on unintended flows or dropping the packet, resulting in a potential denial-of-service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "A malicious user can send a crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packet with Ethernet padding length exceeding 255 bytes to an Open vSwitch instance.",
        "This can be done via network traffic, encapsulated tunnels, or packets from VMs if Open vSwitch runs on a hypervisor."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target Open vSwitch instance."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable including both kernel and userspace datapaths, including DPDK enabled Open vSwitch (OVS-DPDK)",
    "Red Hat Fast Datapath for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8",
    "Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)",
    "Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7",
     "Debian 9 (stretch)",
     "Fedora 33"
  ],
  "patches": [
    "Patches for the vulnerability are available for Open vSwitch versions 2.5.x and newer, including versions 2.14.2, 2.13.3, 2.12.3, 2.11.6, 2.10.7, 2.9.9, 2.8.11, 2.7.13, 2.6.10, and 2.5.12."
