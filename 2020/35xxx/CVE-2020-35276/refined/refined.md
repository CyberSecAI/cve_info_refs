- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input. The application directly uses the username field value in a SQL query without proper sanitization or using parameterized statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, it is exploitable via an error-based SQL injection, however, this article demonstrates the use of a boolean-based SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can bypass the admin login panel and gain full administrative access. This allows the attacker to add or remove any user, potentially gaining control of the application and its data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the login form on the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the application. They do not need any valid credentials to successfully exploit the vulnerability and gain admin access.
