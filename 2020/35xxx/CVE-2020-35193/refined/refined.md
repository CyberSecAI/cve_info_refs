Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improperly configured `etc/shadow` file within the official SonarQube Docker images using Alpine Linux. This configuration results in a blank password for the root user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Empty Password:** The primary weakness is the presence of an empty password for the root user in the `/etc/shadow` file of the affected Docker images. This allows for trivial remote authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the container with root privileges.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can potentially disrupt the service provided by the SonarQube instance.
-   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker gains root access inside the container, allowing for complete control of the SonarQube instance and potentially the host environment.
-   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored within the SonarQube instance and potentially the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Docker Image:** The attack vector is through the use of the vulnerable SonarQube Docker images, specifically the Alpine variants.
-   **Remote Access:** A remote attacker can attempt to log in as the root user via SSH or other remote access mechanism with the blank password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the deployed SonarQube Docker container.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that the deployed version is vulnerable and that a blank password for the root user exists.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content lists a large number of specific SonarQube docker image tags affected by this issue, all using the "-alpine" suffix, indicating that this vulnerability is specific to the Alpine-based docker images of SonarQube.
- The provided content includes a link to the official SonarQube docker hub page as a reference: `https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube`.
