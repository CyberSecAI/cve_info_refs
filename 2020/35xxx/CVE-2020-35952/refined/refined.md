Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the application's behavior of returning different error messages depending on whether a username exists or not.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
User enumeration vulnerability is present in the login page of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can identify valid usernames by observing the different error messages. This makes brute-force attacks or targeted login attempts easier, because the attacker can focus on existing users rather than trying arbitrary usernames.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the login page of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires no special privileges or position beyond being able to access the login page. They only need to try different usernames and analyze the response messages.

**Additional Details:**
The application in question is PHP-Fusion, version 9.03.90. When a valid username with a wrong password is provided during login, the application returns "Enter valid Password". However, if a wrong/non-existing username is entered, it throws a different message, allowing the attacker to enumerate valid usernames.
