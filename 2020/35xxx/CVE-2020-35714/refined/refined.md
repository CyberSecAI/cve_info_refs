Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35714:

**Verification:**
The content directly references CVE-2020-35714 and provides specific details about the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the `pingTestIP` parameter within the `/goform/systemCommand` endpoint. This allows for command injection via a crafted GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system through the vulnerable parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input.
- **Authentication Bypass**: The exploit does not require authentication as implied in the content. However, another part of the blog post shows an exploit where authentication is first bypassed using an hardcoded password (0000074200016071000071120003627500015159) which is not needed in the case of this exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Linksys RE6500 device. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    - Full device control
    - Data exfiltration
    - Installation of malware
    - Device disruption

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/goform/systemCommand` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Linksys RE6500 device or have network access to it.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/systemCommand`) and the vulnerable parameter (`pingTestIP`).
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP GET request, which can be done via various tools or scripts (like the python script provided in the content).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in firmware versions v1.05 up to v1.08 of the Linksys RE6500, according to the blog post, but it was fixed in v1.0.11.001.
- The blog post also includes a Python script that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability, including how to enable telnet.
- The researcher, RE-Solver, reported the vulnerability to Belkin, and was later authorized to publish after a firmware fix was released.
- The vulnerability was assigned a base score of 8.8 (High) by NVD.
