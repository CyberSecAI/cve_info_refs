The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Classbooking v2.2.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when importing a CSV file for new user creation. Specifically, the "username" field from the CSV file is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL code injected within the CSV file's username field is executed when the application processes the import, leading to arbitrary database manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By injecting a `UNION SELECT` statement, an attacker can write malicious PHP code to a file within the web server's directory if MySQL has write permissions, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server. In the provided example the attacker is attempting to create a `phpinfo` page.

**Attack vectors:**
- **CSV file upload:** The vulnerability is triggered through the user import functionality which involves uploading a specially crafted CSV file containing malicious SQL code within the username field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the application to access the user import functionality.
- The attacker needs to upload the maliciously crafted CSV file.
- The MySQL user used by the application must have write permissions to the file system in order for the `INTO OUTFILE` clause to succeed.
