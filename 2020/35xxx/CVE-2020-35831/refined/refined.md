The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified by PSV-2018-0508. Although the advisory does not directly reference CVE-2020-35831, it details a vulnerability and its fix in multiple router models.

Based on this information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A stored XSS vulnerability exists within the web interfaces of multiple Netgear router and WiFi system models. This means that malicious scripts can be stored on the device and executed when other users access the vulnerable sections of the web interface.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary script execution within the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. 
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the web interface of the affected Netgear devices. An attacker would need to inject malicious javascript code into fields that store data without proper sanitization. When another user, likely an admin, accesses that page with the malicious script, it will get executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker likely needs to be able to manipulate settings or data on the affected device through the web interface, or through an authenticated API. The attacker would need to know specific fields in the web interface that could store malicious payloads. Also, the vulnerability can also be triggered if an admin user visits the compromised web interface through a crafted link.

The advisory provides more information than the CVE description, listing specific affected models and firmware versions, as well as a CVSS v3 score, vector and mitigation advice.
