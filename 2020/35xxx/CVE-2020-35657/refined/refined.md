Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35657:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Jaws Web Application Framework's theme upload functionality. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate uploaded theme files, leading to the ability to upload malicious files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users (specifically, administrators) to upload theme files without sufficient checks on the file content or type.
- **Path Traversal:** The provided exploit suggests the possibility of uploading files to arbitrary locations using path traversal techniques within the theme archive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g., `cmd.php`) disguised as a valid theme file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Theme Upload Feature:** The vulnerability is triggered via the theme upload functionality in the Jaws admin panel.
- **Malicious Theme File:** An attacker crafts a ZIP archive that contains a malicious file (e.g., PHP shell). This file is uploaded as a theme and then accessed via a web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the theme upload functionality.
- **Knowledge of Jaws CMS:** Attacker needs to know the upload process of the CMS.
- **Network Access to the Target:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Jaws server and access the created webshell.

**Technical Details:**
The provided `README.md` from the second GitHub content includes a short description of the exploit, along with sample usage for a Python script named `jaws-rce2.py`. This script automates the following process:
1. **Upload of a malicious theme:** The script uploads a malicious ZIP file containing `cmd.php` to the server.
2. **Shell Access:** After successful upload, the attacker can access the created shell by browsing to `http://<target_ip>/jaws-master/jaws-master/data/themes/cmd.php?c=<command>`.

The first github content provides a link to the Jaws Project repository, while the second provides the exploit and additional information related to CVE-2020-35657.
