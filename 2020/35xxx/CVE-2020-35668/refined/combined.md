## Description

![@cr0hn](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4076390?u=5b6602ee6066e699c6fc8297f75978de1864bf68&v=4&size=48)[cr0hn](https://github.com/cr0hn)opened [on Dec 21, 2020](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/1502#issue-772219124)
## Bug impact

Redis Graph crashes and server downs

## Bug explained

It's appear that Redis Graph doesn't processes well list of unknown data types. Typing this in the CLI, server crashes:

```
> GRAPH.QUERY "myGraph" "CYPHER A=[a]"

```

It also crashes with any invalid values in `A`.

### @jeffreylovitz **[jeffreylovitz](/jeffreylovitz)** commented [Dec 21, 2020](#issue-772369421)

Causes a compile-time error to be emitted when parameters refer to AST identifier nodes (unquoted strings).

Resolves [#1502](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/issues/1502).

Sorry, something went wrong.

* Replace the cache-per-thread with a global cache:
-Use rwlock to synchronize access to the cache.
-Replace the hash lookup of queries strings with rax to support safe access of multiple readers.
-When cache hit occurs, do (shallow) memcpy of the query AST along with reference count increase, and store the current execution params in the new AST copy.

* Fix memory leaks.
Bug fix: set AST in thread local storage after the shallow copy.

* Update comments in config files and number of threads in test_cache to fit the new cache design.

* Change cache implementation so that cache item is copied within the cache get/set functions by using a callback. This ensures that cache item will not be freed when evicted from cache while it is cloned by another thread.

(cherry picked from commit [aa66db8](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/commit/aa66db8a4e7103d57d4da5a127adabcedbfaa6c2))

* Replace cache per thread with global cache ([#1393](https://github.com/RedisGraph/RedisGraph/pull/1393))

* global cache

* Replace the cache-per-thread with a global cache:
-Use rwlock to synchronize access to the cache.
-Replace the hash lookup of queries strings with rax to support safe access of multiple readers.
-When cache hit occurs, do (shallow) memcpy of the query AST along with reference count increase, and store the current execution params in the new AST copy.

* Fix memory leaks.
Bug fix: set AST in thread local storage after the shallow copy.

* Update comments in config files and number of threads in test_cache to fit the new cache design.

* Defending execution plans that are being cloned from evicted by another thread, by adding ref count.

* Change cache implementation so that cache item is copied within the cache get/set functions by using a callback. This ensures that cache item will not be freed when evicted from cache while it is cloned by another thread.
