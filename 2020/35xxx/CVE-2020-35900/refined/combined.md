## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Sep 26, 2020](https://github.com/raviqqe/array-queue/issues/2#issue-709451297)

In the `pop_back` function, `self.length - 1` is used as the index:

[array-queue/src/array\_queue.rs](https://github.com/raviqqe/array-queue/blob/32fa10f8f15140fb64a4cf36a2a834f876c91056/src/array_queue.rs#L98)

Line 98
in
[32fa10f](/raviqqe/array-queue/commit/32fa10f8f15140fb64a4cf36a2a834f876c91056)

|  | let x = replace(&mut self.array.as\_mut()[self.length - 1], unsafe { |
| --- | --- |

This means that after you perform a `pop_front` there is the potential to read from uninitialized or previously dropped memory. This can lead to a double-drop and an arbitrary read primitive from safe rust. Here's a program that exhibits the read behavior:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use array_queue::ArrayQueue;

fn main() {
    {
        // 1. Allows reading of uninitialized memory.
        //
        // A queue of size 3 is setup like this:
        //     [x, x, x]    length = 0
        //      ^           start
        // where x is uninitialized memory.
        //
        // push_back(a); push_back(b); push_back(c)
        //     [a, b, c]    length = 3
        //      ^           start
        //
        // pop_front(); pop_back():
        //     [x, b, x]    length = 1
        //         ^        start
        //
        // At this point when performing a pop_back, the queue should use the
        // `ArrayQueue::index` method to index into the array properly but
        // instead simply uses `self.length - 1` causing it to read the first
        // x.
        // https://github.com/raviqqe/array-queue/blob/32fa10f8f15140fb64a4cf36a2a834f876c91056/src/array_queue.rs#L98
        let mut a: [u64; 32] = [0x41; 32];
        let mut x: ArrayQueue<[[u64; 32]; 3]> = ArrayQueue::new();
        x.push_back(&&a);
        x.push_back(&&a);
        x.push_back(&&a);

        x.pop_front().unwrap();
        x.pop_back().unwrap();

        let popped = x.pop_back().unwrap();
        println!("Contents of array: {:?}", popped);
        assert_eq!(popped[0], 0x41);
    }

    {
        // 2. Initializes memory with mem::uninitialized, this is instantly
        //    UB for types that cannot inhabit uninitialized. Should be
        //    changed over to MaybeUninit. (Triggers a panic on latest Rust).

        //let mut x: ArrayQueue<[Box<i32>; 3]> = ArrayQueue::new();
        //x.push_back(&Box::new(1));
    }
}
```

The second part is a bit harder to fix. Rust now has a type called `MaybeUninit` that is used to safely initialize types in uninitialized memory. I'd recommend at least fixing the index problem in `pop_back`.

### Description

array\_queue implements a circular queue that wraps around an array. However, it
fails to properly index into the array in the `pop_back` function allowing the
reading of previously dropped or uninitialized memory.
