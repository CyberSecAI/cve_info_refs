Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-35565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The login pages' brute-force detection mechanism is disabled by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307):** The lack of enabled brute-force protection allows attackers to make unlimited login attempts without being blocked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts via brute-force attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   An attacker can repeatedly attempt to log in with different credentials using automated tools or scripts to compromise user accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.
*   No specific user privileges or authentication is needed to attempt a brute-force attack due to the lack of rate limiting or account lockout.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in MB connect line's mymbCONNECT24 and mbCONNECT24 products in versions up to 2.6.2.
*   The vulnerability is related to a weak default configuration.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
*   A mitigation was provided by enabling the brute-force detection functionality (Fail2Ban) via the web interface.
*   It's also advised to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
*   A full fix for this vulnerability was planned in a future architectural core-system-update.
