Based on the provided information, the content is relevant to CVE-2020-35753.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** HTML Injection
*   **Root Cause:** The online applicant portal of Persis High-Level Human Resource Software lacked input validation in the job recommendation form. Specifically, the `ABSENDER` parameter was vulnerable.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `ABSENDER` parameter with HTML code, an attacker could inject arbitrary content into the email sent via the "recommend job posting" feature.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Spam emails could be sent with attacker-defined content, potentially leading to phishing or malware distribution.
    *   The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blacklisting the domain due to spam activity. This could disrupt both internal and external email communications.
    *   Targeted attacks: Sending emails from a valid and reputable domain can overcome spam mail protection mechanisms for internal staff and external customers alike.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability without authentication.
*   **Affected Versions:** 17.2.00 through 17.2.35 and 19.0.00 through 19.0.20
*   **Mitigation:** Update to versions 17.2.36 or 19.0.21. As a workaround, deactivate the "Stellenausschreibung weiterempfehlen" (job recommendation feature) and replace it with "einfache BrowserfunktionalitÃ¤t (teilen)" (use simple browser functionality).
*   **CVSS Score:**
    *   CVSS 2: 6.4 (Medium) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P)
