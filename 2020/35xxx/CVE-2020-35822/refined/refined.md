The provided content is related to a security advisory for a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router models. Although it does not directly correspond to a CVE, the advisory does mention it is "PSV-2018-0498"

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Stored XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the vulnerable device (router) and executed in the browser of other users when they access specific web pages or configurations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing of user credentials and other sensitive data.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Unauthorized modification of the router's settings.

**Attack vectors:**
* The advisory does not explain the specific attack vector for the XSS, just that it exists.
* The XSS is stored, meaning that the malicious script is saved on the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into a vulnerable parameter of the router's web interface.
*   It appears that successful exploitation also requires an authenticated user to access the vulnerable page. The CVSS vector does not list a need for user interaction. `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`
    *   `AV:A` - Adjacent Network: An attacker on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
    *  `AC:L` - Low: The attack does not require special access conditions
    *  `PR:H` - High: The attacker has high level privileges
    *  `UI:N` - None: No user interaction required
    * `S:U` - Unchanged:  A vulnerability in one system does not have an impact on another system
    *  `C:H` - High: High impact to confidentiality
    * `I:H` - High: High impact to Integrity
    * `A:N` - None: No impact on Availability

**Affected product models and firmware versions:**
*   D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
*   R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
*   R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.74
*   R8900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
*   R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
*  RAX120, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78
*  XR500, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.56
*  XR700, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.10

**Resolution:**
*   The advisory recommends users update to the latest firmware for their respective devices.
