### @pmlopes **[pmlopes](/pmlopes)** commented [May 19, 2020](#issue-621269847) • edited Loading

Signed-off-by: Paulo Lopes pmlopes@gmail.com

Motivation:

It was brought up to us by [@xhlika](https://github.com/xhlika) that the current implementation of `CSRF` on the development branch of what will become `4.0.0` suffered from several security issues when working with session aware tokens. The bug was introduced with: [#1465](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web/pull/1465) and totally ignored the validation of the client side input but rather check what was on the session.

This PR properly fixes it by following the updated recommendations of OWASP <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie> which have been updated Feb 2020 and include new checks that were not performed then and the notes provided by [@xhlika](https://github.com/xhlika) on the potential attack vector.

Tests have been fixed to cover replay attacks on session mode and proper token expiration is tested.

The PR also addresses adding the `SameSite` policy to the cookie (which is a recently added feature to vert.x core and wasn't available at the time of [#1465](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web/pull/1465).

Further, it also cover validating the request origin as per the OWASP recommendations.

Sorry, something went wrong.
