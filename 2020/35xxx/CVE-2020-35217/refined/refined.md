Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35217

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from an improper implementation of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the vertx-web framework. Specifically, the previous implementation, introduced in pull request #1465, failed to properly validate client-side input when working with session-aware tokens. Instead of validating the client-side input, it only checked the session, making it susceptible to replay attacks and other CSRF exploits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient CSRF Token Validation:** The primary weakness was that the server-side code did not properly validate the CSRF token provided by the client. It relied solely on the token stored in the session, which could be replayed.
- **Lack of Origin Validation:** The initial implementation didn't validate the request origin, which would allow requests from unauthorized origins to be processed if the attacker had a valid CSRF token.
- **Missing `SameSite` Cookie Policy:** The cookie lacked the `SameSite` attribute, which helps prevent CSRF attacks by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user by crafting malicious requests with valid CSRF tokens.
- This could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized access, or other security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to trick a legitimate user into making a request to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through various methods like social engineering or by embedding malicious links on other websites.
- The attacker would need to be able to obtain a valid CSRF token, which could be obtained by making a request to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker would then need to craft a malicious request with the valid CSRF token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user to obtain a CSRF token.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the user's browser into sending a malicious request to the vulnerable application (e.g. social engineering)
-  The attacker must be able to craft a valid CSRF token to make the attack work.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The pull request #1613 addressed the vulnerability by implementing the following:
    - Proper validation of the client-side input against the session token to prevent replay attacks.
    - Addition of `SameSite` policy to the cookie to prevent cross-site requests from sending the CSRF cookie.
    - Validation of the request origin, to only accept requests from valid origins.
    - Added tests for replay attacks and token expiration
- The fix was implemented based on the OWASP recommendations for CSRF prevention.

The provided information indicates that the original CSRF protection implementation was flawed in several aspects and the provided fix implemented several security measures, improving the protection.
