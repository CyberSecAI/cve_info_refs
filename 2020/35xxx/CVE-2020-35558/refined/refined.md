Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-35558:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue within the MySQL access check functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-provided input when making requests to internal or external servers. Specifically, this occurs during MySQL access checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability to scan for open ports on internal or external systems. This can lead to the discovery of potential vulnerabilities, internal services, and sensitive information, including potential credentials.
*   The CVSS score indicates a high Confidentiality impact, with no impact on Integrity or Availability, as the vulnerability primarily allows information gathering.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker does not require local access.
*   The attack is low complexity (AC:L), indicating that it's relatively easy to exploit.
*   The attack does not require any privileges (PR:N).
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate or have any prior privileges on the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests that trigger the SSRF vulnerability in the MySQL access check.

**Additional notes:**
* The vulnerability affects the following products: MB connect line mymbCONNECT24, mbCONNECT24 and Helmholz myREX24 and myREX24.virtual through version 2.11.2.
* The vulnerability was reported by OTORIO.
* The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.12.1.
* An "incomplete fix" to the vulnerability was present in earlier versions, which is mentioned in the "SIM#2022-02" section. This suggests that there may be additional information beyond the standard CVE description that could be relevant.
