## Affected versions

< 0.6.1

## Patched versions

0.6.1

## Description

Affected versions of this crate contained a bug in which decoding untrusted input could overflow the stack. On architectures with stack probes (like x86), this can be used for denial of service attacks, while on architectures without stack probes (like ARM) overflowing the stack is unsound and can result in potential memory corruption (or even RCE).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate contained a bug in which decoding untrusted
input could overflow the stack.

On architectures with stack probes (like x86), this can be used for denial of
service attacks, while on architectures without stack probes (like ARM)
overflowing the stack is unsound and can result in potential memory corruption
(or even RCE).

The flaw was quickly corrected by @danburkert and released in version 0.6.1.
