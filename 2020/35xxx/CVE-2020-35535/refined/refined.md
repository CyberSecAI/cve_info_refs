Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2020-35535.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `LibRaw::parseSonySRF()` function when processing SRF files. This occurs because of insufficient buffer size checks before accessing data, specifically when reading data using `sget2` or similar functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- Insufficient buffer size validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the application (ImageMagick in this case) due to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.
- Potential for information disclosure, as out-of-bounds read may expose sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted SRF file.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing the crafted SRF file using the affected software, which uses the libraw library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted SRF file as input to an application that uses the vulnerable `libraw` library.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commit fixes the vulnerability by adding `CHECKBUFFER_SGET4` and similar macros checks before accessing data in `parseSonySRF` function.
- The crash occurs within the `sget2` function, which reads a 2-byte value from the provided buffer. The crash occurs because the read goes beyond the allocated buffer leading to access violation.
- The issue report provides a proof-of-concept file (poc.srf) and the command to trigger the vulnerability via ImageMagick.
