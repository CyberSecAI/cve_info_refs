#### Email Log

With our Email Logging, you can easily store and view a record of all emails sent from your website, providing you with a valuable resource for record-keeping, ensuring email compliance, and debugging during site development.

Our WordPress email logs go beyond just recording emails. With advanced analytics and features, you can measure email engagement and improve email deliverability:

#### Resend Emails

Email Logs make it simple to resend or forward any email directly from the log, which can be incredibly helpful for resending failed emails or forwarding important messages. You can also take advantage of the bulk resend option to quickly resend multiple emails at once.

#### Open and Click Email Tracking

Gain deeper insights into the performance of your WordPress emails by using our email log feature to track opens and clicks. This feature allows you to measure engagement rates and optimize your messaging and calls-to-action for better results.

#### Save Email Attachments

Keep track of all email attachments sent from your WordPress site. This feature allows you to store attachments in one place, making it easy to review and archive them.

#### Export Email Logs

Export your WordPress emails to CSV, EML, or Excel with ease using our intuitive exporter. You can filter the logs by date range, search term, or other criteria to extract only the data you need for your reporting or analysis.

#### Print Emails

Our email logging feature allows you to easily print any email in a clear and easy-to-read format, making it simple to keep track of important email communications. Additionally, you can export email logs to PDF format for convenient digital archiving.

#### Email Alerts

Receive instant notifications if your emails fail to send, with alerts available through Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, SMS/Twilio, webhooks, or email via a secure API.

Combined with our email logging and resending capabilities, Email Alerts guarantee that no critical email will ever be overlooked.

#### Backup Connection

Add a secondary connection that takes over if your main one fails. Easy WP SMTP identifies connection errors and effortlessly shifts to the backup mailer, ensuring that failed emails are automatically retried.

#### Smart Conditional Routing

Set up rules to route different types of emails through various mailers. You can filter by the email’s Subject, Message content, From or To addresses, the plugin that generated the email, and more.

This approach lets you combine transactional and marketing providers for enhanced deliverability.

#### Rate Limiting

Control the frequency of emails sent from your WordPress site within a given time to stay aligned with your SMTP provider’s limitations.

Easy WP SMTP lets you set limits on how many emails can be sent each minute, hour, day, week, or month and automatically manages the email queue to keep you within the allowed rate.

#### Optimized Email Sending

Is email sending affecting your site’s speed? Easy WP SMTP can queue your emails to enhance performance.

With optimized sending, emails are sent in the background when server resources are available, helping to avoid site slowdowns and bottlenecks.

#### Email Reports

Track email deliverability and engagement with our email reports feature, which displays open and click-through rates grouped by subject line, regardless of mailer or SMTP service. The reports also include information on sent and failed emails each week, ensuring that you’re always aware of potential issues. Plus, you can view an email report chart right in your WordPress dashboard for quick and easy access.

#### Weekly Email Summary

Stay on top of your WordPress email statistics with our weekly email reports, sent to your inbox. These reports provide in-depth information on the number of emails sent, as well as opens and clicks. The Summary also shows failed email delivery stats, allowing you to quickly identify any potential issues without having to log into WordPress.

#### WordPress Multisite

*WordPress Multisite Network Settings*

Manage WP Mail SMTP settings for all your multisite subsites in one place, simplifying administration for your multisite network.

*Easily Manage Multisite Emails*

### Easy WP SMTP Plugin Usage

Once you have installed the plugin there are a few options that you need to configure.

The plugin settings can be found in your WordPress Dashboard by clicking on the Easy WP SMTP menu item.

#### Easy WP SMTP Settings

The settings section consists of two sections: Mailer Settings and General Settings.

Mailer Settings

* Mailer Selection: Choose a mailer you want to use (a transactional mailer or an SMTP server).
* Mailer-Specific Settings: Depending on your mailer selection, different settings will be displayed, for you to configure.

General Settings

* From Email Address: The email address that will be used to send emails to your recipients.
* Force From Email: If you want to always overwrite the from email address, which can be set by other plugins.
* From Name: The name your recipients will see as part of the “from” or “sender” value when they receive your email.
* Force From Name: If you want to always overwrite the from name, which can be set by other plugins.

For more information on how you can configure all plugin settings, please visit our [plugin documentation](https://easywpsmtp.com/docs).

#### Easy WP SMTP Email Test

On the Email Test page you can send a test email to your own email address, using your configured mailer or SMTP service, to make sure that your WordPress site is ready to send all outgoing emails.

Once you click the “Send Test Email” button, by default a predefined email template (HTML or plain text) will be sent. But if you prefer, you can also define your own subject and email content in the Email Test settings.

  Setup Wizard – Step 2

## Installation

1. Install Easy WP SMTP either via the WordPress.org plugin repository or by uploading the files to your server. (See instructions on [how to install a WordPress plugin](http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/))
2. Activate Easy WP SMTP.

## FAQ

### Can this plugin be used to send emails via Outlook, Gmail, Google Workspace, Hotmail, Yahoo, Zoho SMTP?

Yes, it can. You should use the dedicated Gmail or Outlook mailer options, since they are faster and more reliable, compared the the “Other SMTP” mailer.

If you want to use other providers, you’ll need to select the “Other SMTP” mailer and configure the correct SMTP host details.

This plugin really does make is exceptionally easy to connect to our SMTP server to send newsletters out and about, once I got the config right it was moments before the Easy WP SMTP did the heavy lifting. It’s steady, reliable, it isn’t buggy and it so refreshing to not have to worry about SMTP for once!

I moved from (WP Mail SMTP by WPForms) because they did something to my website after updates, the emails would not send, I have troubleshoot this issue for hours even contacted my Hosing support, until I realized to install your plugin (Easy WP SMTP) and it worked instantly, what i want to say is that I still run both types of plugins on different websites and the developers of that plugin can cause by updates a a web to not work the plugin.
Anyway I see in both plugins some email sending errors but I can’t upgrade to see those errors, my biz is not profitable at the moment, would like to see what are those errors for free if possible, help me detect who is damaging my biz!

Sometimes it is the easy things that hosting providers make difficult. In my case, smtp email wasn’t working. Not only did this solve it for me, but they have great test tools and documentation. Worth supporting.

#### 1.5.1

* Removed the special Clicky plugin compatibility code as it is no longer necessary.
* Removed the use of deprecated FILTER\_SANITIZE\_STRING.
* Added sanitization to input fields(that were missing it).

* We understand that having the full email in the log file (when debug logging is enabled) to do troubleshooting is helpful but some users can forget to disable the logging feature afterwards. This change was necessary to ensure that sensitive info cannot be exposed unintentionally in the future.

#### 1.4.4

* Added an option to specify BCC email address for the outgoing emails.

* There is a new settings option to enable debug logging.

#### 1.2.7

* Added extra debug info (when test email function is used). This debug info will show more details if anything fails. This will be helpful to debug SMTP connection failure on your server.

#### 1.2.6

* Some special characters in the password field were getting removed when the text sanitization was done. This has been improved.
* The settings configuration will not be deleted if you deactivated the plugin. This will prevent configuration loss if you accidentally deactivate the plugin.

#### 1.2.5

* Fixed possible XSS vulnerability with the email subject and email body input fields.

#### 1.2.4

* Improved the admin interface.
* The test email details now gets saved after you use it. So you don’t need to type it every single time you want to send a test email.

* Easy WP SMTP is now compatible with WordPress 4.5.

#### 1.2.2

* Easy WP SMTP is now compatible with WordPress 4.4.

# WordPress Easy WP SMTP plugin fixed zero-day vulnerability.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [December 7, 2020 - 1:28pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:21pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-easy-wp-smtp-plugin-fixed-zero-day-vulnerability/)

The WordPress [Easy WP SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-wp-smtp/) plugin, which has 500,000+ active installations, fixed a zero-day vulnerability affecting version 1.4.2 and below that could allow an unauthenticated user to reset the admin password among other issues.

> This vulnerability is currently exploited, make sure to update as soon as possible to the latest version.

The Easy WP SMTP plugin has an optional debug log where it writes all email messages (headers and body) sent by the blog. It is located inside the plugin’s installation folder, “/wp-content/plugins/easy-wp-smtp/”. The log is a text file with a random name, e.g., 5fcdb91308506\_debug\_log.txt. The plugin’s folder doesn’t have any index.html file, hence on servers that have directory listing enabled, hackers can find and view the log:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/easy-wp-smtp-zero-day_1.png)

Then, they perform the usual username enumeration scans to find the admin login name, for instance via the REST API:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/easy-wp-smtp-zero-day_2.png)

Hackers can also perform the same task using author achive scans (`/?author=1`).

They access the login page and ask for the reset of the admin password:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/easy-wp-smtp-zero-day_3.png)

Then, they access the Easy WP SMTP debug log again in order to copy the reset link sent by WordPress:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/easy-wp-smtp-zero-day_4.png)

With that link, they reset the admin password:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/easy-wp-smtp-zero-day_5.png)

They log in to the admin dashboard and, on all WordPress hacked sites we saw, they immediately install rogue plugins on the blog.

### Recommendations

Update immediately if you have version 1.4.2 or below installed.

Consider disabling the debug log, as it could leak sensitive information (messages, passwords etc).

If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.
