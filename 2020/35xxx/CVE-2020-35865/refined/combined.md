### Description

The Windows implementation of this crate relied on the behavior of
`std::char::from_u32_unchecked` when its safety clause is violated.
Even though this worked with Rust versions up to 1.42 (at least),
that behavior could change with any new Rust version, possibly leading
a security issue.

The flaw was corrected in version 2.0.0.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @eduardosm **[eduardosm](/eduardosm)** commented [Apr 14, 2020](#issue-599772067)

The way this function is being used is directly violating its safety clause. Just because the standard library does it internally, it does not mean that it safe do it in non-standard crates.

That behavior is not documented and may change at any moment (which includes crashing or producing a different result).

The current implementations of `encode_utf8` and `encode_utf16` have been copied from Rust's libcore, changing the parameter type from `char` to `u32`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| You're 100% correct. My goal has been to avoid reimplementing WTF-8 from the standard library, but I've realized that's unavoidable.  I've actually already written an implementation locally and plan to publish later this week, once I've vetted it using some of my local projects. I was able to get rid of the `unreachable!` call and not require buffers to be created with a specific size.  I think it would be better to use that implementation instead, so I'll be closing this. However, thanks for the PR anyway! |
