{
  "cve": "CVE-2020-35416",
  "affected_product": "PHPJabbers Appointment Scheduler 2.3",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the 'index.php' login portal webpage, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary script or HTML, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites. If the attacker gains control of the administrator's session, they could have full control over the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects malicious code into request parameters of the 'index.php' webpage, such as the 'date', 'action' and other URL parameters. This injected script is then reflected in the response.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the injected script and trick a user into visiting this crafted URL. This may involve techniques such as social engineering to send malicious links via email or other means."
