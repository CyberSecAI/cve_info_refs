Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect lifetime boundary definitions in the `raw_slice` and `raw_slice_mut` methods of the `RowMut` struct in the `rulinalg` crate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The methods do not adhere to Rust's borrowing rules, specifically, they incorrectly bound the returned slice by `'a` instead of `'self`. This allows multiple mutable references to the same memory location to be created.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Creation of multiple mutable references to the same memory location leads to a data race when these references are used concurrently.
- This can result in unexpected calculation results and undefined behavior.
- The severity is rated as Critical due to potential for data corruption and crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through normal use of the library's API by calling `raw_slice` or `raw_slice_mut` on `RowMut` and subsequently operating on returned slices concurrently.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to use the affected `rulinalg` crate. No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on Feb 11, 2020, and made public later.
- The affected versions are between `0.4.0` and `0.4.2` inclusive.
- No patched version is available.
- The vulnerability is tracked as `CVE-2020-35879`, `GHSA-q2gj-9r85-p832` and `RUSTSEC-2020-0023`.
- The issue was discussed in [AtheMathmo/rulinalg#201](https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rulinalg/issues/201).
- The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical).
