## Package

cargo

rulinalg
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.4.0, <= 0.4.2

## Patched versions

None

## Description

The affected version of rulinalg has incorrect lifetime boundary definitions for RowMut::raw\_slice and RowMut::raw\_slice\_mut. They do not conform with Rust's borrowing rule and allows the user to create multiple mutable references to the same location. This may result in unexpected calculation result and data race if both references are used at the same time.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@Qwaz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5073807?u=2ce3c5e94d4fa1db409878d8812e2dfe6cb164bf&v=4&size=48)[Qwaz](https://github.com/Qwaz)opened [on Feb 11, 2020](https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rulinalg/issues/201#issue-563350960)

The current definition of `raw_slice` and `raw_slice_mut` creates `'a` bounded reference from `&self`. Since the returned slice is created from a stored pointer in `&self`, it should be bounded by `'self` lifetime instead of `'a`.

With the current definitions of those methods, it is possible to cause data race with safe Rust code.

```
use rulinalg::matrix;
use rulinalg::matrix::BaseMatrixMut;

fn main() {
    let mut mat = matrix![0];

    let mut row = mat.row_mut(0);

    // this creates mutable aliases to the same location
    let raw_slice1 = row.raw_slice_mut();
    let raw_slice2 = row.raw_slice_mut();

    assert_eq!(raw_slice1[0], 0);
    raw_slice2[0] = 1;
    assert_eq!(raw_slice1[0], 0);
}
```
