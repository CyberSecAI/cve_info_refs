Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35451:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the `OozieSharelibCLI` component of Apache Oozie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the timing of operations during the creation of the sharelib.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation. A malicious attacker can replace files within Oozie's sharelib during its creation. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Oozie process, potentially leading to further system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have access to the machine running Oozie to be able to exploit the race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the `OozieSharelibCLI` during the creation of the sharelib. This likely requires having some level of access or the ability to influence the sharelib creation process.
-The attacker needs to be local to the system.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Apache Oozie versions prior to 5.2.1.
- Mitigation involves validating the contents of the sharelib after uploading it. This suggests a method to detect and potentially prevent the file replacement.
