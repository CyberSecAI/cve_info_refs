{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `NotNan` type in the `ordered-float` crate could contain a `NaN` (Not a Number) value after a panic during assignment operations like `add_assign` or `mul_assign`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `NotNan` type was intended to always contain a valid floating-point number (not NaN), but due to a flaw, it could hold a NaN value after a panic in assignment operators if unwinding is used or the panic is caught. The `NotNan::cmp` method internally uses unsafe code, assuming the value is not `NaN` which can result in undefined behavior if this assumption is violated.",
      "The assignment operators could modify the operand even when the result would be NaN, causing the value to become invalid."
   ],
    "impact": "Undefined behavior in safe code due to the `NotNan::cmp` method's unsafe assumptions about the value not being NaN. Undefined behavior in third-party unsafe code which makes the same assumption.  Logic errors in safe code that assume the value is not NaN.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local, through the use of the affected `ordered-float` crate and its assignment operators.",
    "required_capabilities": "Low privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
