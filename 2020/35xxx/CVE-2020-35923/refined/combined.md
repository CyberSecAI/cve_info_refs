### Description

After using an assignment operators such as `NotNan::add_assign`, `NotNan::mul_assign`, etc., it was possible for the resulting `NotNan` value to contain a `NaN`. This could cause undefined behavior in safe code, because the safe `NotNan::cmp` method contains internal unsafe code that assumes the value is never `NaN`. (It could also cause undefined behavior in third-party unsafe code that makes the same assumption, as well as logic errors in safe code.)

This was mitigated starting in version 0.4.0, by panicking if the assigned value is NaN. However, in affected versions from 0.4.0 onward, code that uses the `NotNan` value during unwinding, or that continues after catching the panic, could still observe the invalid value and trigger undefined behavior.

The flaw is fully corrected in versions 1.1.1 and 2.0.1, by ensuring that the assignment operators panic without modifying the operand, if the result would be `NaN`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Oh, I understand now. During unwinding, or if the panic is caught, a `NotNan` ends up containing `NaN`. This can lead to UB in unsafe code that assumes `NotNan` never contains `NaN`, including the implementation of `NotNan::cmp` which can be called from safe code.  Good catch, and thanks! |

`[ordered_float:NotNan may contain NaN after unwinding in assignment op…](/mbrubeck/advisory-db/commit/502923888e1b18e009a4afe5a976f3d9d7829c53 "ordered_float:NotNan may contain NaN after unwinding in assignment operators

After using an assignment operators such as `NotNat::add_assign`,
`NotNan::mul_assign`, etc., it was possible for the resulting `NotNan`
value to contain a `NaN`.  This could cause undefined behavior in safe
code, because the safe `NotNan::cmp` method contains internal unsafe
code that assumes the value is never `NaN`.  (It could also cause
undefined behavior in third-party unsafe code that makes the same
assumption, as well as logic errors in safe code.)

This was mitigated starting in version 0.4.0, by panicking if the
assigned value is NaN.  However, in affected versions from 0.4.0 onward,
code that continued after using unwinding to catch this panic could
still observe the invalid value and trigger undefined behavior.

The flaw is fully corrected in versions 1.1.1 and 2.0.1, by ensuring
that the assignment operators panic without modifying the operand, if
the result would be `NaN`.

| I haven't fixed this on the ordered-float 0.5 branch, because backporting is non-trivial and the test suite on that branch uses unstable features that are broken in modern Rust toolchains. There are only a few actively-developed crates still using ordered-float 0.5, and the ones with source code available (descartes, prolog\_parser, scryer-prolog) are not impacted by this bug.  Anyone using ordered-float 0.5 should upgrade to a newer version as soon as possible. |
