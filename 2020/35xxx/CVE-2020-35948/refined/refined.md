Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unprotected AJAX endpoint in the XCloner Backup and Restore WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `wp_ajax_restore_backup` action did not properly implement the same access control check (`check_access()`) as other AJAX actions within the plugin. This oversight allowed low-privileged users to access functions intended for administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Inadequate Access Control:** The `restore_backup` function failed to use the `check_access()` function, bypassing the intended authorization checks.
2.  **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The `write_file_action` function, accessible through the vulnerable endpoint, enabled authenticated users to overwrite any file on the server. This includes critical files like `wp-config.php`.
3.  **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The `get_current_directory` function, also accessible through the vulnerable endpoint, revealed the database credentials and the absolute path of the WordPress installation.
4.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Almost all endpoints in the plugin lacked CSRF protection (nonces), allowing attackers to trigger actions (e.g. backups, settings updates) by tricking an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers could overwrite PHP files with malicious code, leading to remote code execution on the server.
2.  **Website Takeover:** Overwriting `wp-config.php` would allow attackers to connect their database, effectively taking control of the website.
3.  **Data Breach:** Exposure of database credentials could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as user data and site content. Attackers could also use this to add an admin account to take control of the WordPress instance.
4.  **Malicious Actions via CSRF:** Attackers could use CSRF to trigger backups or update plugin options, potentially leading to data loss or compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Unprotected AJAX Endpoint:** The `wp_ajax_restore_backup` endpoint is directly accessible to authenticated users, even those with subscriber-level privileges.
2.  **CSRF:** Attackers could craft malicious links or websites that, when visited by an authenticated user, would trigger actions on the vulnerable site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the vulnerable WordPress site (at least subscriber-level access is required for the RCE vector).
2.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site.
3. For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a crafted URL or website

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions 4.2.1 to 4.2.12 of the XCloner Backup and Restore plugin.
*   Version 4.2.13 addressed the unprotected AJAX vulnerability. Version 4.2.153 included a fix for the CSRF vulnerabilities.
*   The CVSS score is 9.9 (Critical)
*   Exploit code is publicly available, which greatly increases the risk to unpatched systems.
*   Wordfence premium users received a firewall rule to protect from this vulnerability on August 17, 2020, and free users on September 17, 2020.
