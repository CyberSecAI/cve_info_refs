Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35882:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `Clone` trait implementation for `LocalRequest` in the `rocket` crate reuses the raw pointer to the inner `Request` object. This means that when `LocalRequest` is cloned, both the original and the clone point to the same underlying `Request` data structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Data race:** The vulnerability arises because multiple `LocalRequest` instances can now modify the same underlying `Request` object concurrently. This violates Rust's memory safety rules and can lead to data races when the original and cloned `LocalRequest` objects modify the same data simultaneously.
- **Unsound API:**  The `Clone` implementation for `LocalRequest` is unsound, as it allows for the creation of multiple mutable references to the same object, which is not safe in Rust. This is a deviation from the expected behavior of a `Clone` implementation.
- **Iterator Invalidation:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates a classic iterator invalidation scenario. By modifying the underlying request headers through the cloned `LocalRequest`, a previously obtained iterator can become dangling, leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Memory corruption:** The data race can lead to memory corruption, as different threads or parts of the program might try to modify the same data simultaneously without proper synchronization, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Arbitrary code execution (potentially):** The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to overwrite the pointer and length of a string slice. While the PoC causes a segmentation fault due to the dangling pointer, this sort of memory corruption could be used in a more sophisticated attack to gain arbitrary code execution in vulnerable programs.
- **Application crash:** The memory corruption can result in application crashes, as demonstrated in the provided PoC which resulted in a segmentation fault.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attack vector is network, although the vulnerability is within a testing API. This implies that an attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by crafting specific inputs or requests to an application utilizing the vulnerable `rocket` crate. However, this is not straightforward to exploit in the normal use of a `rocket` application, as `LocalRequest` is primarily intended for testing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to trigger cloning:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the cloning of `LocalRequest` and subsequently modify both the original and the clone. This requires the attacker to have control over program flow to execute the code path where cloning occurs and subsequent modifications happen on both instances.
- **Knowledge of the API:** A deep understanding of the `rocket` API and the specific usage of `LocalRequest` is needed for successful exploitation. This isn't something that would happen easily in the wild, given that this is within the testing API.

**Additional Notes:**

- This issue primarily affects users who use `LocalRequest` and clone it in specific, vulnerable patterns.  
- While the `LocalRequest` is primarily intended for testing, the security impact is still relevant because it violates memory safety and could lead to exploitable memory corruption.
- The fix involves preventing multiple mutable references to the same `Request` object, achieved through changes such as using `get_mut()` or `make_mut()` to ensure exclusive access or cloning the underlying `Request` on clone.
