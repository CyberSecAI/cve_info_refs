Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35499

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `sco_sock_getsockopt` function within the Linux kernel's Bluetooth SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented) socket implementation. The function lacks a necessary sanity check to ensure a socket connection exists before accessing the `sco_pi(sk)->conn` member. If the socket is not connected, `sco_pi(sk)->conn` will be NULL, leading to a dereference of a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Sanity Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check to verify if a Bluetooth SCO socket is connected before accessing its connection-related members.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  When an unconnected SCO socket is used with `getsockopt` and `BT_SNDMTU` or `BT_RCVMTU`, the `sco_pi(sk)->conn` is dereferenced while being a NULL pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference leads to a kernel crash, causing a denial of service.
- **Potential Information Leak:**  The provided description also mentions a possible kernel information leak, but this is less detailed than the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system.
- **Specific User Privilege:** The attacker needs a special user privilege.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user access with special privileges.
- Ability to interact with Bluetooth SCO sockets using `getsockopt` with `BT_SNDMTU` or `BT_RCVMTU` parameters on an unconnected socket.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `net/bluetooth/sco.c` file of the Linux kernel.
-  A patch is available in the upstream kernel repository.
- Red Hat has determined that no shipped kernel versions were affected.
- There are no available mitigations based on Red Hat's criteria.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in kernel 5.11.
