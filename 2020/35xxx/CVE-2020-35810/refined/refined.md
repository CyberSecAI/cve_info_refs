The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0491, which affects multiple router and WiFi system models.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability present in the web interface of the affected NETGEAR devices. The advisory does not provide the technical details of the vulnerability itself beyond that it's stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected device.
- These scripts could be executed in the context of other users who access the interface.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected NETGEAR devices.
- An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious scripts into a field that is stored by the device and later displayed to users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to have some degree of access to the device, possibly requiring authentication to inject malicious scripts.
-The CVSS vector indicates the attacker needs to be within the adjacent network (AV:A).
-The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H)

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
The following product models and firmware versions are affected:
*   D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
