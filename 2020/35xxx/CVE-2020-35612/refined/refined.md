  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially access files outside of the intended directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'folder' parameter of the mod_random_image module.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable module, likely through the web interface."
