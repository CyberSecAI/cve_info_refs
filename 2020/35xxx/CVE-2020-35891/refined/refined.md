Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `compact::Vec` implementation of the `ordnung` crate. Specifically, the `remove()` function is not panic-safe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double-Free:** The `remove()` function in `compact::Vec` can cause a double-free when an index larger than the length of the vector is provided. This indicates a flaw in how memory is managed when removing elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Availability:** A successful double-free can lead to memory corruption, which could cause a crash, or denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not require any privileges, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited by any user or process that can interact with the affected code.
- No user interaction is required.
- Low attack complexity.
