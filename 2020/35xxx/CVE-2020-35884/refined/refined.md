Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35884:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of `Transfer-Encoding` headers in the `tiny_http` crate. This improper parsing allows for HTTP request smuggling attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Malformed `Transfer-Encoding` Headers:** The core issue is the failure to correctly handle malformed or invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers. This leads to a discrepancy in how the server and intermediaries interpret the request.
*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The vulnerability specifically enables HTTP request smuggling attacks. This involves manipulating the `Transfer-Encoding` headers to create a situation where an attacker can inject a crafted request that will be misinterpreted and treated as part of a subsequent legitimate request by an intermediary (like a web cache or a reverse proxy) or the backend server itself.
*   **CL:TE/TE:TE:** The specific type of request smuggling attack enabled is CL:TE or TE:TE, where the attacker manipulates both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers or two `Transfer-Encoding` headers to cause a conflict in how a message is parsed and interpreted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker could manipulate the HTTP response to poison a web cache, causing it to store malicious or incorrect responses for legitimate requests.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By manipulating responses, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to XSS attacks on users of the affected application.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information from other user requests. This could occur when the attacker is able to inject their request in the middle of the request stream destined for another user. This could cause the response to that other user to be interpreted as a response to the attacker and thus leak the information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploitation involves sending crafted HTTP requests with malformed `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to carry out an attack.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified by both CVE-2020-35884 and RUSTSEC-2020-0031 and GHSA-7v2r-wxmg-mgvc.
*   Patches have been released in versions 0.8.0 and above and 0.6.3 and above.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `tiny_http` by updating the crate, including a fix for the incorrect header parsing, and also introducing a compat package for versions 0.6.x
*   The vulnerability affects the `tiny_http` crate before versions 0.8.0.
