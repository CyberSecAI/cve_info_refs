Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Package Updates" module of Webmin. Specifically, the package name variable is directly inserted into a system command without proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by exploiting how the system interprets specific characters like newlines and ampersands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The package name, received via an HTTP request, is used in a system command executed by the Webmin server.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Webmin fails to adequately sanitize or escape special characters in the package name, leading to the injection vulnerability.
*   **Bypass of Previous Fix:** The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous attempt to fix CVE-2019-12840, which addressed a similar issue. The fix involved escaping certain characters but did not account for all possible attack vectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain complete control over the vulnerable system, including accessing sensitive data, installing malware, and modifying system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `update.cgi` script within the "Package Updates" module.
*   **URL Encoding:** The attacker uses URL encoding to include special characters such as newline (`%0A`) and double ampersand (`%26%26`) within the package name parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Webmin Access:** The attacker must have a valid Webmin user account with permissions to access the "Package Updates" module.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Webmin server to send malicious HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `update.cgi` script, specifically when the `package_install()` function is invoked.
* The package name variable `$p` is passed to the `update_system` function, which generates a system command using `apt-get` (in Debian based systems) with the unsanitized package name.
* The fix for CVE-2019-12840 escaped some characters but failed to account for newlines.
* Injecting a newline character with `%0A` allows an attacker to break out of the package name context and inject arbitrary commands. The `&&` (%26%26) is used to chain the injected commands.
* The metasploit module uses a base64 encoded payload to execute arbitrary commands on the target.

**Vulnerable Software:**
*   Webmin versions 1.962 and lower are vulnerable.

The content also provides a Metasploit module to exploit this vulnerability, which includes code to:

*   Authenticate to the Webmin interface
*   Check if the user has permissions to access "Package Updates"
*   Construct a malicious request to the `update.cgi` script with a payload, to execute arbitrary commands
