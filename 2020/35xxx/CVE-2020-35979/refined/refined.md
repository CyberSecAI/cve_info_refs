Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35979:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `gp_rtp_builder_do_avc` function located in `ietf/rtp_pck_mpeg4.c`. This issue arises due to an incomplete fix of a previous bug, likely related to handling of NALU (Network Abstraction Layer Unit) sizes within the RTP packetization process for AVC (Advanced Video Coding) video.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to read or write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
-   Incomplete fix: The issue stems from an insufficient patch for a previous, related vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   Denial of Service (DoS): The heap-buffer-overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
-   Potential for Code Execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Malicious MP4 file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted MP4 file. The file contains specific data that causes `gp_rtp_builder_do_avc` to write beyond allocated buffer during the RTP packetization of AVC video.
-   Specifically, the PoC file [gp\_rtp\_builder\_do\_avc-hepo](https://github.com/Clingto/POC/blob/master/gpac-MP4Box/gpac-c4f8bc6e_poc/gp_rtp_builder_do_avc-hepo) is used to demonstrate the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application (`MP4Box` tool in this case).
-   No specific position or privilege is required to exploit this vulnerability, beyond being able to supply the malicious file to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability was found using AddressSanitizer, which is a memory error detector.
-   The vulnerability is located in `ietf/rtp_pck_mpeg4.c:436`.
-   The issue was triggered during the processing of a sample through the `gf_hinter_track_process` function.
-   The `gf_rtp_builder_do_avc` function is responsible for building RTP packets.
-   The provided commit `b15020f54aff24aaeb64b80771472be8e64a7adc` attempts to fix this issue.
-   The fix involves an additional check for a zero size NALU and using `gf_rtp_builder_process` in the `else` clause after the check.
