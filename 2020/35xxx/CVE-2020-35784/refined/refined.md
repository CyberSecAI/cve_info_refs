- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing function level access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The affected Netgear switches lack proper access controls for certain functionalities. This allows an attacker with high privileges to potentially perform actions they should not be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access and modification of the device settings, potentially causing disruption to network operations. The confidentiality, integrity and availability of the device and network can be impacted.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based, exploitation would require network access to the device management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to have high privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The specific level of access needed is not stated beyond "high privilege".
