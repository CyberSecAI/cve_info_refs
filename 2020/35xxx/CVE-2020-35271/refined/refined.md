{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'First Name' and 'Last Name' fields, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as: \n  - Session hijacking by stealing cookies \n  - Defacement of the website \n  - Redirecting users to malicious websites\n  - Harvesting user credentials or other sensitive information.\n\nSince it is a persistent XSS, the payload is stored and executed each time the page is loaded. This can impact all users who view the page with the malicious input.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the Employee Performance Evaluation System 1.0. Specifically, the 'First Name' and 'Last Name' fields in the 'Add New' employee functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Employee Performance Evaluation System to insert the malicious payload through the web interface. After the payload is stored, any user who views the affected page in the system is a potential victim."
