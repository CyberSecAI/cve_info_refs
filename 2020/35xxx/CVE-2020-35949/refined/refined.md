Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-35949:

**CVE-2020-35949**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insecure file upload handling within the Quiz and Survey Master plugin. Specifically, the plugin's file upload feature performs insufficient checks on the uploaded file type, relying solely on the "Content-Type" field, which can be easily spoofed by an attacker.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Insecure File Upload**: The plugin does not properly validate the file type of uploaded files. It relies on the "Content-Type" header, which can be manipulated by an attacker to upload arbitrary file types, including executable PHP files.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize the file type before processing the upload.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete takeover of the website and potentially the hosting account.
    *   **Site Compromise**: Attackers can gain full control of the website, allowing them to inject malicious scripts, steal data, or use the site for other malicious activities.
    *   **Hosting Account Compromise**: In severe scenarios, attackers can compromise the entire hosting account if the webserver user has enough privileges, potentially affecting other sites hosted on the same server.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Unauthenticated File Upload**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user, where the plugin has the file upload feature enabled within a quiz.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: While less likely, the vulnerability can be exploited via CSRF attacks targeting administrators.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Basic HTTP Knowledge**: Attackers need to know how to manipulate the "Content-Type" header during an HTTP request.
    *   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability if a quiz with the file upload functionality is enabled on the site.
    *   **Access to Quiz with File Uploads**: The attacker needs to target a quiz that is configured to allow file uploads. If the site has a compromised user with contributor or higher privileges, the attacker can create a quiz with the file upload function enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and the steps taken to mitigate it.
*   The article mentions a second vulnerability, CVE-2020-35951, related to unauthenticated arbitrary file deletion, which is separate from CVE-2020-35949, but they are both in the same plugin, Quiz and Survey Master.
*   The vendor has released a patch (version 7.0.1) to address these vulnerabilities.
*   Wordfence users received initial protection against these vulnerabilities from their firewall, with premium users receiving an additional rule for CSRF protection on August 5, 2020. Free users received the rule on September 5, 2020.
