Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-35274:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content includes an entry from Exploit-DB (EDB-ID: 49168) which describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DotCMS version 20.11. While the CVE ID is not mentioned in the exploit-db content, the described vulnerability and affected software correlate with the type of issue commonly associated with XSS vulnerabilities. However, without explicit mention of CVE-2020-35274, a direct link cannot be confirmed.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization when setting the "Template Title" during the creation of a new template designer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, user-supplied input is not sanitized, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Template Title" field. When other users navigate to the template section, this script will be executed in their browsers. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious activities on their behalf.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative privileges to access and modify template designers.
    *   The injected XSS payload is stored within the application database.
    *   When a user views the template list or the modified template, the XSS payload is executed within their session, affecting all users who access the page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative access to the dotCMS platform to create or modify template designers.
    *   The attacker must craft a malicious JavaScript payload that will be injected into the "Template Title" field.
    *  The attacker needs to be logged in with admin credentials

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a detailed, step-by-step process to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The provided content highlights the importance of proper input validation, especially for user-supplied data, to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit author explicitly states the vulnerable parameter is "Template Title".
*   The attack is stored (persistent), meaning the malicious script is stored in the database.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a Stored XSS vulnerability in dotCMS version 20.11 that matches the type of issue expected with CVE-2020-35274. The root cause is a lack of input sanitization of the "Template Title" field. This allows an attacker with admin access to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of users who access the template section.
