The paperless transactions allow new investors to start a SIP or invest a lumpsum with ease.

**Exploit**

Input an incorrect username (one that doesn’t exist), and the application will respond with an error message “We are unable to recognize the use user id entered.” If the valid username is entered and an invalid password is provided, application responds with “the password entered is incorrect,” which assists the attacker in enumerating valid usernames.

**Proof Of Concept**

The first screenshot shows that the user exists

The second screenshot shows that the user does not exist
