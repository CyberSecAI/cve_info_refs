Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35580:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of vulnerabilities:
  1. **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `/searchblox/servlet/FileServlet` endpoint accepts a `url` parameter that is intended for URLs but can be manipulated to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
  2. **Lack of Authentication:** The LFI vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
  3. **Information Disclosure:** The LFI vulnerability allows access to sensitive files, such as `/opt/tomcat/webapps/searchblox/WEB-INF/config.xml`, which contains:
        - A "Super Admin API Key"
        - Usernames along with Base64 encoded SHA1 password hashes
  4.  **Unrestricted API Access:** The "Super Admin API Key" allows API calls that are normally restricted to a super admin user.
  5. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application's indexing functionality can be abused to make requests to attacker-controlled servers and then ingest the response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **LFI:** The `url` parameter in `FileServlet` is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive information (API key, user credentials) is exposed through LFI.
*   **Insecure API Access:** The API key provides excessive privileges and lacks access controls.
*   **SSRF:** The application’s indexing function can be abused to trigger requests to external servers and index the content.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `url` parameter, allowing for arbitrary file paths.
*   **Lack of authentication/authorization:** Access to the vulnerable `FileServlet` is not restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read any file on the server's filesystem, which can lead to further information disclosure, including configuration files, credentials, and source code.
*   **Account Takeover:** Exposed password hashes can be cracked, leading to user account compromise.
*   **Full Administrative Control:** The exposed "Super Admin API Key" grants full administrative control of the application, allowing an attacker to manipulate and take over the searchblox platform.
*   **AWS Metadata Exposure:** The SSRF vulnerability can be leveraged to extract AWS metadata, potentially leading to further compromise of the AWS environment.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can index arbitrary content from other sites and expose it in the searchblox UI.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** Attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `FileServlet` endpoint with a malicious `url` parameter, such as `/etc/passwd` to trigger the LFI.
*   **API abuse:**  The API key can be used to make calls to functions that are normally restricted to Super Admin users, allowing to modify the application or even perform code execution.
*   **SSRF through Indexing:** Attackers exploit the application's indexing feature to fetch content from their servers, in this specific case using redirects to target the AWS metadata endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SearchBlox instance.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and manipulate query parameters.
*   **Knowledge of the SearchBlox API:** The attacker needs to be able to make use of the API calls and the application’s functionality to add collections and index documents.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided blog post goes into much more detail regarding the exploit than a standard CVE description.
*   The author of the blog post demonstrates how the vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve significant impact.
*   The author also explains how the SearchBlox API can be used maliciously and how an attacker can use a redirect to the AWS metadata endpoint to expose sensitive credentials.
