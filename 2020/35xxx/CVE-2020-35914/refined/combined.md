Affected Functions
Version
`lock_api::MappedMutexGuard`

* `>=0.1.0`

`lock_api::MappedRwLockReadGuard`

* `>=0.1.0`

`lock_api::MappedRwLockWriteGuard`

* `>=0.1.0`

`lock_api::RwLockReadGuard`

* `>=0.1.0`

`lock_api::RwLockWriteGuard`

* `>=0.1.0`

### Description

Affected versions of lock\_api had unsound implementations of the `Send` or
`Sync` traits for some guard objects, namely:

* MappedMutexGuard
* MappedRwLockReadGuard
* MappedRwLockWriteGuard
* RwLockReadGuard
* RwLockWriteGuard

These guards could allow data races through types that are not safe to `Send`
across thread boundaries in safe Rust code.

This issue was fixed by changing the trait bounds on the `Mapped` guard types
and removing the `Sync` trait for the `RwLock` guards.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
