Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35914:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `lock_api` crate had unsound implementations of the `Send` or `Sync` traits for several lock guard objects. Specifically,  `RwLockWriteGuard` was vulnerable.
*   These unsound implementations allowed data races to occur through types that are not safe to send across thread boundaries in safe Rust code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Data races:** The core vulnerability is the possibility of data races occurring due to the incorrect implementation of `Send` or `Sync` traits on lock guard objects.
*   **Unsound `Send` and `Sync` implementations:** The `MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, and `RwLockWriteGuard` types were incorrectly marked as `Send` or `Sync` when they could allow unsafe access.
*  **CWE-362:** This vulnerability is categorized as a race condition issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data corruption:** Data races can lead to unpredictable behavior, including data corruption.
*   **Availability issues:** The race conditions can lead to deadlocks and other concurrency issues, affecting the availability of the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to be running code within the same process as the vulnerable application.
*   **Concurrency:** The vulnerability is triggered when multiple threads are used to access data protected by the affected guards.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to create threads:** The attacker needs to be able to create and manage multiple threads.
*   **Concurrent access to shared data:** The attacker needs to be able to cause concurrent access to shared data protected by the affected guards.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was fixed by changing the trait bounds on the `Mapped` guard types and removing the `Sync` trait for the `RwLock` guards.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the `lock_api` crate prior to 0.4.2.
*   The vulnerability is related to a fix in the `parking_lot` crate, which `lock_api` uses.
*   CVSS v3 base score: 4.7/10
*   CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically by identifying the vulnerable types (`MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, `RwLockWriteGuard`) and the root cause (unsound `Send` and `Sync` implementations). It also mentions the fix and the affected versions.
