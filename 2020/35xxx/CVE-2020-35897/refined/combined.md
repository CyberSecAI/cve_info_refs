## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Sep 21, 2020](https://github.com/slide-rs/atom/issues/13#issue-705813395)

I noticed there's been a bunch of changes on master contributed by [@dbkaplun](https://github.com/dbkaplun) that haven't made their way out onto the cargo crate. Most importantly, the latest release, 0.3.5 is missing [dc096ef](https://github.com/slide-rs/atom/commit/dc096ef61a7cf69ce1a833a277b1c2a7c726c129) which fixes a fairly important soundness issue around the `Send` trait's bounds.

Without this commit, it's possible to `Send` across unsafe objects like `Rc` and potentially run into data races like so:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

extern crate atom;

use atom::Atom;
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::{thread, time, mem};

const NUM_CLONES: usize = 10000000;

fn main() {
    let x = Rc::new(());
    let y = Rc::clone(&x);

    // Place our Rc in the Atom through a Box.
    let shared_atom = Atom::empty();
    shared_atom.swap(Box::new(x));

    let child = thread::spawn(move || {
        // We now have the Rc shared across a thread.
        let x = shared_atom.take().unwrap();
        for _ in 0..NUM_CLONES {
            let clone = x.clone();
            mem::forget(clone);
        }
    });

    for _ in 0..NUM_CLONES {
        let clone = y.clone();
        mem::forget(clone);
    }

    // Wait for the spawned thread to finish its cloning.
    child.join().unwrap();

    // We made NUM_CLONES on both threads plus 2 references in the main thread.
    // But in reality we'll see that the strong_count varies across every run.
    assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&y), (NUM_CLONES * 2) + 2);
}
```

This could lead to use-after-frees and is a fairly easy mistake to make.

### Description

The `atom` crate contains a security issue revolving around its implementation
of the Send trait. It incorrectly allows any arbitrary type to be sent across
threads potentially leading to use-after-free issues through memory races.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
