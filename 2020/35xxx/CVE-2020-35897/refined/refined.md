Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35897:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an unsafe implementation of the `Send` trait in the `atom` crate. The `Send` trait in Rust is used to mark types that can be safely transferred between threads. The `atom` crate incorrectly allowed any arbitrary type to be sent across threads without proper synchronization or checks, leading to potential data races. Specifically, the issue arises because the `Atom` type, intended for thread-safe data sharing, did not enforce the necessary bounds on the types it held. This allowed non-thread-safe types like `Rc` (reference-counted pointer) to be transferred between threads, violating Rust's memory safety guarantees.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect `Send` Implementation:** The core weakness is the flawed implementation of the `Send` trait for the `Atom` type.
-   **Data Races:** By allowing non-`Send` types to be sent between threads, the code introduces the possibility of data races.
-  **Use-After-Free:** The data races could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, where memory is accessed after being deallocated, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Memory Corruption:** Data races can corrupt memory, leading to unpredictable program behavior.
-   **Use-After-Free:** The vulnerability can result in use-after-free conditions.
-   **Denial of Service:** Due to memory corruption and potential crashes the vulnerability can lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Multi-threaded Programs:** Exploitation requires a program that uses multiple threads and the vulnerable `atom` crate.
-   **Sending Non-Thread-Safe Types:** The exploit involves placing a non-thread-safe type (like `Rc`) into the `Atom` container and transferring this between threads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Control Program Logic:** An attacker must be able to control the program's logic to send non-thread-safe types across threads using the `atom` crate.
-   **Use of the vulnerable crate:** The attacker needs to use the `atom` crate in their application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided code example demonstrates how the vulnerability could be triggered by using `Rc` with the atom crate, resulting in inconsistent reference counts and potential use-after-frees.
-   The issue was fixed in version 0.3.6 of the `atom` crate.
-   The vulnerability is considered to have a moderate severity, with a CVSS score of 4.7.
- The vulnerability has been assigned the CWE-362 "Race Condition"
