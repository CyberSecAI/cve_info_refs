Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35427 (although this CVE is a placeholder for description retrieval, the exploit information strongly suggests it is related to the identified vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL Injection vulnerability in the login functionality of the "Employee Record Management System 1.1" application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the login fields, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to inadequate input sanitization.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the login authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the application without valid credentials.
- **Data Breach:** Once logged in, the attacker may be able to access, modify, or delete sensitive employee records.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the application's functionality, further exploitation may be possible, leading to a more severe compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web-based login form.
- **Malicious SQL Payload:** The attack vector involves injecting a specific SQL payload into the "User ID" and "Password" fields of the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web application's login page.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQLi:** The attacker needs to know basic SQL injection techniques.
- **No Credentials Needed:** The attacker does not require valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The specific SQL payload used for the bypass is: `' or '1'='1`. This payload, when inserted into the login fields, results in a SQL query that always evaluates to true, bypassing authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content from exploit-db.com provides more detail than the official CVE description, by specifying the exact vulnerable software and the bypass payload.
- The vulnerable application is identified as "Employee Record Management System 1.1".
- The software link points to a specific page on phpgurukul.com, indicating the source of the vulnerable application.
- The exploit was tested on a Linux Parrot OS environment.

This analysis provides a clear picture of the SQL injection vulnerability, its impact, and the necessary attack steps.
