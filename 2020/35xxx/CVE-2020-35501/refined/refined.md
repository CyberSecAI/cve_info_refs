Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Linux kernel's audit subsystem was not logging access to the `open_by_handle_at` syscall when used by users with the `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability. This means that while access control was still enforced, attempts to access files via this syscall were not being recorded in the audit logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incomplete Auditing: The primary weakness is that the audit subsystem failed to record attempts to use the `open_by_handle_at` syscall with `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability. This is a flaw in the implementation of audit rules.
- Lack of Visibility: This vulnerability leads to a lack of visibility into file access attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Reduced Monitoring: The main impact is that security monitoring is undermined because administrators cannot detect or track the use of `open_by_handle_at` by users with the `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability. This makes it harder to identify suspicious activity related to file access.
- Hinders Forensics: In the event of an incident, the lack of audit logs could make it more challenging to understand how attackers accessed certain files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Use of `open_by_handle_at` syscall with `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`: An attacker would need to use the `open_by_handle_at` syscall with the `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability: The attacker would need to have a process running with the `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability. This capability allows bypassing discretionary access control checks, specifically when searching directories.
- Ability to use `open_by_handle_at` syscall: The attacker needs to be able to call this specific system call.
- System Access: The attacker would need some form of access to the system in order to be able to execute code and use this syscall.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue does not grant attackers any additional access that they wouldn't already have. The vulnerability lies in the lack of auditing, not a privilege escalation.
- The bug report mentions that the syscall can still be audited by using the 'syscall auditing feature' and explicitly specifying the `open_by_handle_at` syscall in the audit rule.
- The bug is marked as "CLOSED WONTFIX," likely because the issue is considered a low-severity flaw in auditing rather than a security vulnerability that needs to be fixed in the kernel.
- The issue was public on 2021-02-18.
