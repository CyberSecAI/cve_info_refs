This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and range extender models. While it doesn't explicitly reference CVE-2020-35808, it provides information about a similar vulnerability, so it is potentially related.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a stored XSS vulnerability in the web interface of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means that malicious script is saved on the device (in the settings/configuration) and executed when an authenticated user accesses it.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of an authenticated user's browser session. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    - Deface the web interface of the device.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into fields or areas in the web interface that are not properly sanitized or validated, such as device names or configuration settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable fields of the web interface
- The attacker would need an authenticated user to access the interface to trigger the exploit.
- The attacker would need to have some form of access to the web interface or another way to manipulate device configuration (local or through another vulnerability)
