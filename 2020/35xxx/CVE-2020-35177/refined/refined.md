The content from `discuss.hashicorp.com` directly references CVE-2020-35177 and provides information related to it. The github content does not relate to this CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way Vault's LDAP authentication method handled error messages. Specifically, the system returned detailed error messages that could be used to enumerate valid usernames within the LDAP directory.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is information disclosure through the exposure of valid usernames due to overly specific error messages in the LDAP auth method.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially enumerate valid users from an LDAP server. This information can be used in other attacks, like password guessing or brute-force.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Vault's LDAP authentication endpoint by sending login requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the Vault server and be able to send login requests using the LDAP authentication method.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in Vault 1.4.1 and was fixed in versions 1.6.1 and 1.5.6.
*   The vulnerability was reported by an external party to HashiCorp.
