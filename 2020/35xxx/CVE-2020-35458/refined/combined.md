# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).

Subject: Security issues in hawk2 and crmsh

Hi folks,

We have received reports of 2 security issues for hawk and crmsh. These
hawk and crmsh projects refer to distros@ for their disclosure work.

These issues were reported to SUSE by Vincent Berg of Anvil Ventures.

1. Remote unauthenticated shell injection into the Hawk webserver

   Hawk is a High Availability specific webconsole with its own webserver.

   The Hawk webserver versions 2.2 up to now have a shell code injection
   issue via the "hawk_remember_me_id" cookie.

   It can be triggered from 2 places, via /login (with login_from_cookie) and /logout
   interfaces.

   The cookie value is passed unquoted and unfiltered from ruby to a
   shell command as commandline argument. (Using %[shellcommand] pattern.)

   As hawk is running as "hauser" usually, this allows unauthenticated
   remote attackers to gain access to the "hauser" account.

   Introduced by <https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/commit/a939a099c6abdac383fbaede5e8655853222c887#diff-5349b200e8dc7ea82818115aa0aa1522>

   We have received CVE-2020-35458 from Mitre for this issue.

   Our team did a fix that does not use an subshell to invoke the command, patch is attached.

2. Local root privilege escalation via hawk and crmsh shell code injection

   crmsh is a commandline shell utility to query or configure a HA cluster.

   The Hawk webconsole contains a "setuid root" helper tool called "hawk_invoke", which
   allows hawk to call some root functionality in "crmsh".

   hawk_invoke allows calls from "hauser" or "vagrant" users only.

   hawk_invoke has a whitelist of "crmsh" commandline options, but does not do any
   filtering or blocking of stdin.

   The "crm history" sub-command is whitelisted by hawk_invoke.

   It opens its own sub-shell with various commands, one of them is "session create SESSION"
   This subcommand will create a directory "SESSION" by calling:

		if utils.pipe_cmd_nosudo("mkdir -p %s" % session_dir) != 0:

   which again does not filter the input.

   This allows local privilege escalation from "hauser" or "vagrant" to root.

   We have received CVE-2020-35459 from Mitre for this issue.

   Currently we will fix only the unsafe mkdir and add ; to the blacklist filtering, a patch is attached.

Due to shortness of time we did not yet do a full (re)audit of crmsh and hawk, we are currently working on that.

The whole hawk_invoke setuid root setup also needs a full redesign.

Ciao, Marcus

[LEAP12/SLE12: hawk](/ClusterLabs/hawk/releases/tag/2.3.0-12)

# Features:

* Allow also users in haclient to view history explorer ([#214](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/pull/214))
* Disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 via puma ([#217](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/pull/217)). This differ for SLE15 versions.

  This allows to disable via puma config disabling TLS 1.0 and TLS.1.1. (see <https://gist.github.com/MalloZup/f7cd3020e1165c800a4323860e8acb86>) for documentation howto.

# Bugfixes:

* handle properly in the webui when a Cluster resource has the same name of a node of cluster ([#210](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/pull/210))

Message-ID: <20210112125959.GI7776@suse.de>
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 2021 13:59:59 +0100
From: Marcus Meissner <meissner@...e.de>

Subject: Security issues in hawk2 and crmsh

Hi folks,

We have received reports of 2 security issues for hawk and crmsh. These
hawk and crmsh projects refer to distros@ for their disclosure work.

These issues were reported to SUSE by Vincent Berg of Anvil Ventures.

1. Remote unauthenticated shell injection into the Hawk webserver

   Hawk is a High Availability specific webconsole with its own webserver.

   The Hawk webserver versions 2.2 up to now have a shell code injection
   issue via the "hawk_remember_me_id" cookie.

   It can be triggered from 2 places, via /login (with login_from_cookie) and /logout
   interfaces.

   The cookie value is passed unquoted and unfiltered from ruby to a
   shell command as commandline argument. (Using %[shellcommand] pattern.)

   As hawk is running as "hauser" usually, this allows unauthenticated
   remote attackers to gain access to the "hauser" account.

   Introduced by <https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/commit/a939a099c6abdac383fbaede5e8655853222c887#diff-5349b200e8dc7ea82818115aa0aa1522>

   We have received CVE-2020-35458 from Mitre for this issue.

   Our team did a fix that does not use an subshell to invoke the command, patch is attached.

2. Local root privilege escalation via hawk and crmsh shell code injection

   crmsh is a commandline shell utility to query or configure a HA cluster.

   The Hawk webconsole contains a "setuid root" helper tool called "hawk_invoke", which
   allows hawk to call some root functionality in "crmsh".

   hawk_invoke allows calls from "hauser" or "vagrant" users only.

   hawk_invoke has a whitelist of "crmsh" commandline options, but does not do any
   filtering or blocking of stdin.

   The "crm history" sub-command is whitelisted by hawk_invoke.

   It opens its own sub-shell with various commands, one of them is "session create SESSION"
   This subcommand will create a directory "SESSION" by calling:

		if utils.pipe_cmd_nosudo("mkdir -p %s" % session_dir) != 0:

   which again does not filter the input.

   This allows local privilege escalation from "hauser" or "vagrant" to root.

   We have received CVE-2020-35459 from Mitre for this issue.

   Currently we will fix only the unsafe mkdir and add ; to the blacklist filtering, a patch is attached.

Due to shortness of time we did not yet do a full (re)audit of crmsh and hawk, we are currently working on that.

The whole hawk_invoke setuid root setup also needs a full redesign.

Ciao, Marcus
