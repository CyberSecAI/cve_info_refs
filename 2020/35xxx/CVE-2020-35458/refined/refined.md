{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Hawk webserver uses the `hawk_remember_me_id` cookie value without sanitization when constructing a shell command. This cookie value is used as a command-line argument in a shell command using the `%[shellcommand]` pattern.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Shell code injection",
      "Unfiltered user-controlled input"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary code as the `hauser` user, which is the user Hawk typically runs as. This allows for complete compromise of the Hawk server and potentially the cluster it manages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP request to `/login` with `login_from_cookie`",
      "HTTP request to `/logout`"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Hawk webserver. No authentication is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "Hawk webserver versions 2.2 up to 2.3.0-x",
    "vulnerable_code": "The vulnerability was introduced by commit `a939a099c6abdac383fbaede5e8655853222c887` in the `hawk/app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb` file.",
    "fixed_versions": "The fix replaces the use of subshells to invoke commands with a safer method. Releases 2.6.15 (SLE15/Leap15) and 2.6.12 (SLE12/Leap12) include the fix.",
