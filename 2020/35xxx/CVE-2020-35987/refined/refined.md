Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or modifying entities, specifically within the "Entities" feature. It attempts to remove script tags, but this is insufficient to prevent XSS, as demonstrated by the payload using an `onerror` event within an `<img>` tag.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly HTML entity encode user input before reflecting it back to the page, which allows malicious scripts to be executed in the context of other users' browsers.

*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when other users access the affected page. This can lead to various impacts including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Entities" feature, accessible to authenticated users. Malicious input is injected when creating a new entity, or potentially when editing an existing one.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application. They need the ability to create or modify entities within the application through the "Entities" feature.
