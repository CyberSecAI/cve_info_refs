Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35885:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `StrcCtx` struct in the `alpm-rs` crate, which improperly deallocates memory. Specifically, the `Drop` implementation of `StrcCtx` calls `str_fromraw!` (which deallocates memory pointed to by `self.ptr`) regardless of how the `StrcCtx` was created. If `StrcCtx` is not created using its provided `new` method (which allocates memory using `strc_noctx!`) the `drop` implementation will try to deallocate memory it doesn't own.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Memory Deallocation:** The core issue is that the `StrcCtx` destructor attempts to free memory that it may not have allocated. This occurs when a `StrcCtx` is created with a pointer to memory that was not allocated via the `strc_noctx!` macro.
*   **Double-Free/Use-After-Free:** This improper deallocation leads to memory corruption issues such as double-free vulnerabilities when the same memory region is deallocated more than once, or use-after-free vulnerabilities when the memory has been freed and is accessed afterwards.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in memory corruption, which can lead to unpredictable program behavior.
*   **Program Crash:** As shown in the provided demonstration code, this corruption can cause program crashes.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities could potentially be leveraged for more severe exploits like arbitrary code execution, depending on how the memory is used after being freed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Instantiation of `StrcCtx`:** The primary attack vector is by creating a `StrcCtx` object and initializing the `ptr` field to point to a memory region other than one allocated by the `strc_noctx!` macro.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to use the `alpm-rs` crate:** An attacker needs to be able to use the vulnerable `alpm-rs` crate in their Rust program, but does not need any elevated privileges or user interaction.
*   **Code manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to directly instantiate `StrcCtx` in a way that uses a pointer to memory not allocated by the intended macro (`strc_noctx!`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided demonstration code illustrates how the vulnerability can be triggered and the resulting memory corruption via an assertion failure.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, categorized as CRITICAL, indicating a high severity issue.
*   There are currently no patched versions for this vulnerability.
