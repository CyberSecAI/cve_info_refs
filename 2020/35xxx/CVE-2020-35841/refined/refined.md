The provided content is related to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but it is associated with Netgear's advisory PSV-2019-0013, and not specifically to CVE-2020-35841. The advisory lists multiple router models affected by the XSS vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the web interface of the affected Netgear router models.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning malicious scripts can be stored on the router and executed when other users interact with the affected part of the interface.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they access the router's management interface. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement of the management interface, or other actions on the user's behalf.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the routers, likely through a user-supplied input field that is not properly sanitized.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to have some level of access to the router's web interface to inject the malicious script. This might be achieved by having an authenticated session or by exploiting another vulnerability that grants this access. The attacker would likely need to be on the same local network, or have access to the router remotely. The vulnerability requires user interaction for the XSS to execute, meaning a legitimate user of the router's interface has to view the malicious content.

The following router models are listed as vulnerable:
* D6200
* D7000
* JNR1010v2
* JR6150
* JWNR2010v5
