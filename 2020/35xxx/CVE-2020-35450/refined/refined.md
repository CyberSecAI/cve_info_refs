Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a NULL pointer dereference in Gobby's `TextSessionView::set_language` function. Specifically, the `this` pointer (referring to the `TextSessionView` object) could be NULL when the function was called via a D-Bus call when there is no document open in Gobby, because m_current_view would be NULL. The code was asserting that m_current_view is not NULL and crashing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code directly uses `this` without checking if it's NULL, resulting in a crash when `this` is NULL when calling gtk_source_buffer_set_language.
- **Lack of Proper Input Validation/State Checking:** The application does not properly validate the state before executing actions through D-Bus, allowing a call to be made when no document is open.
- **Over-reliance on Assertions:** The code used `g_assert` to check for a valid `m_current_view`, which leads to program termination instead of graceful error handling when the assertion fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could trigger a crash of the Gobby application by sending a D-Bus call to change the language when no document is open. This would effectively disrupt the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **D-Bus Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered via a D-Bus call to set the language of a text session.
- **No Document Open:** The attack is effective when no document is open in Gobby.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send D-Bus messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send D-Bus messages to the Gobby application. This could potentially be achieved by any local user.
- **Knowledge of D-Bus interface:** The attacker needs to know the specific D-Bus method to call to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix involved replacing the `g_assert` with a warning message and ignoring the call when no current view exists.
- The vulnerability was initially misdiagnosed as an issue with the `language` pointer being NULL. It was later correctly identified that the `this` pointer was the issue.
- The fix was implemented to prevent the crash, although the underlying issue of being able to make the dbus call when no document is open remains, but is deemed acceptable.
