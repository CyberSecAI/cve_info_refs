Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a double-free issue within the `compact::Vec` implementation of the `ordnung` crate for Rust.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Double Free:** The `remove()` function in `compact::Vec` is not panic-safe and leads to a double free when an index larger than the length is provided.
2.  **Out-of-bounds access/Allocator mismatch:** The `compact::Vec` mishandles large capacities, leading to out-of-bound access in 32-bit systems and allocator layout mismatches in 64-bit systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the double-free vulnerability can lead to:

*   **High Availability Impact:** A double-free can cause program crashes, leading to denial of service.
*   **Potential Memory Corruption:** Depending on how the memory is managed after the double-free, it might lead to memory corruption and other unpredictable behaviors.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, indicating that the vulnerability can be triggered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send input to the vulnerable `ordnung` crate via a network interface to trigger the double free or cause out-of-bounds access.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `ordnung` crate versions <= 0.0.1.
*   No patched versions are available yet.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 (High).
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2020-35891 and GHSA-4wj3-p7hj-cvx8.
