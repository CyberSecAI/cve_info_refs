Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35869:

**Verification:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2020-35869 is one of the CVEs associated with multiple memory safety issues found in the `rusqlite` crate, as indicated by the RustSec advisory RUSTSEC-2020-0014. The advisory lists CVE-2020-35869 along with other CVEs that were fixed in version 0.23.0.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a combination of unsafe code practices in the `rusqlite` crate that led to various memory safety issues. Specifically for CVE-2020-35869, this is related to how the `rusqlite::trace::log` function handles format strings.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Format String Vulnerability:** The `rusqlite::trace::log` function was vulnerable to format string injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Format String Vulnerability:** This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service depending on the attacker's ability to control the log message passed to the `rusqlite::trace::log` function.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to be able to control the arguments passed to the `rusqlite::trace::log` function, specifically the format string parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need the ability to influence the input provided to the `rusqlite::trace::log` function. This likely means that the attacker has some ability to control parts of the application being developed.

**Summary of the Fixes in `rusqlite` 0.23.0:**
The release notes for `rusqlite` version 0.23.0, indicate various memory safety fixes, including:
* Making VTab / VTabCursor `unsafe trait`
* Correcting how `create_module` takes its parameters.
* Correcting how `UnlockNotification` mutex is used
* Fixing the format string vulnerability in `rusqlite::trace::log`
* Fixing use-after-free and data race in auxdata API
* Correcting representation of Rust types as C types
* Fixing use-after-free in sessions.rs
The fixes target unsafe code usage discovered during an audit of the `rusqlite` crate.
