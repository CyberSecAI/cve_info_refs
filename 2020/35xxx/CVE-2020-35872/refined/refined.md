Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35872:

**CVE-2020-35872** is one of several vulnerabilities addressed in the `rusqlite` crate version 0.23.0. The primary source of information for this CVE is the RustSec advisory `RUSTSEC-2020-0014`.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `rusqlite::vtab::create_module` function.  The function was taking a `&Module` which was treated as a `&'static Module` reference. This was unsound, because the reference could outlive the actual module object, leading to memory unsafety.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsound Lifetime:** The `create_module` function had an incorrect assumption about the lifetime of the module object, potentially leading to dangling references and use-after-free scenarios. Specifically, the API treated the lifetime of the passed in reference as static even though it wasn't guaranteed to be.
- **Memory Safety Violation:** This incorrect lifetime handling could lead to memory corruption and other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation could lead to memory corruption, potentially enabling attackers to achieve code execution or cause a denial of service. Since the code is in Rust, memory corruption is a serious issue that could result in arbitrary program behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
Attackers would need to use the `rusqlite::vtab::create_module` function with a module object that has a lifetime shorter than what the function expected. This might involve creating a malicious module and passing it to `create_module`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to interact with the `rusqlite` library directly or via an application that uses `rusqlite`.
- They need to be able to call the vulnerable function with crafted input.
- No specific privilege is mentioned for the attacker.

**Additional Details**

*   The fix involved changing the function to take a `&'static Module`, enforcing that the module passed in has a static lifetime which must be guaranteed.
*   The issue is resolved in `rusqlite` version 0.23.0.
*   This vulnerability is also listed under GHSA-q3cc-7p7g-392c
*   The vulnerability is in the `rusqlite` crate, not in the underlying `libsqlite3-sys`.
