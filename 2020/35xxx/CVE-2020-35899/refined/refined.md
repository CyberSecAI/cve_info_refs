Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35899:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a custom implementation of a `Cell` primitive within the `actix-service` crate. This bespoke `Cell` implementation failed to properly track mutable references to the underlying data it was managing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsound Custom Cell Implementation:** The core issue was that the custom `Cell` did not enforce Rust's borrowing rules regarding mutable references. Specifically, `Cell::get_mut()` used `Rc::as_ref()`, which did not distinguish between mutable and immutable references, leading to the possibility of obtaining multiple mutable references to the same memory location.
*   **Lack of Mutability Tracking:** The custom `Cell` lacked the necessary logic to ensure that only one mutable reference to the underlying data could exist at any given time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Memory Corruption:** The primary impact of this vulnerability was the potential for arbitrary memory corruption. This could manifest in various ways, such as data corruption, unexpected program behavior, and crashes.
*  **Use-After-Free:** As a direct consequence of the memory corruption, a use-after-free condition was the most likely outcome, which would lead to a crash and unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through local access, meaning the attacker would need to have the ability to execute code within the same memory space as the vulnerable application. This is based on the CVSS vector `AV:L`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges can trigger the vulnerability, indicated by `PR:L`.
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction (`UI:N`).
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code that utilizes the flawed `Cell` implementation, which could be either their own code or existing code within the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was resolved by replacing the custom `Cell` implementation with the standard `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.
* The vulnerability is present in versions of actix-service before 1.0.6.
*  The vulnerability could be triggered through the public API.
*  The fix was backported and a RustSec advisory was created, so developers are aware of the need to update.
