### @Shnatsel **[Shnatsel](/Shnatsel)** commented [Jul 19, 2020](#issue-660886039)

Right now the custom cell is unsound because `Cell::get_mut()` uses `Rc::as_ref()` to obtain a reference to the underlying data, which does not distinguish between mutable and immutable references, and so does not guarantee uniqueness. Thus it is possible to obtain several mutable references to the same memory location by calling `Cell::get_mut()` repeatedly:

```
let mycell = Cell::new(vec![1,2,3]);
let ref1 = mysell.get_mut();
let ref2 = mysell.get_mut(); // obtained a second mutable reference; UB starts here
```

This unsoundness can even be triggered from the public API (see [PoC that fails MIRI](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=3b2cabc2ba83096418d55ecee5c71809)). It may result in pretty much arbitrary memory corruption, most likely a use-after-free.

This PR removes the unsound custom cell and replaces it with `Rc<RefCell<T>`. This reverts the code to the way it was before the introduction of the custom cell in [20b03a4](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/commit/20b03a478063d6bb293a6636632f976113812e13)

I expect performance to take a slight hit, but the difference not to be noticeable outside of microbenchmarks. `cargo bench` shows no difference between this branch and master.

The code is heavily based on the patch by [@Nemo157](https://github.com/Nemo157) <https://gist.github.com/Nemo157/b495b84b5b2f3134d19ad71ba5002066>, all I did was resolve conflicts with latest master.

This PR supersedes [#113](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/113) which has been stuck for 6 months and didn't fix the problem entirely, since the unsound custom cell was still in use.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Description

The custom implementation of a Cell primitive in the affected versions of this crate
does not keep track of mutable references to the underlying data.

This allows obtaining several mutable references to the same object
which may result in arbitrary memory corruption, most likely use-after-free.

The flaw was corrected by switching from a bespoke `Cell<T>` implementation to `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
