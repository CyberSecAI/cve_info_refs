The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35826.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The specific cause is not detailed in this advisory, but it stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before it is stored and rendered within the web interface of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.
- These scripts would execute in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected parts of the web interface.
-  This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, redirecting users to malicious websites, or even taking control of the device itself if the user is an administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts into a field that is later displayed on the web interface.
- The specific field or injection point is not described in the advisory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to write to the affected storage area of the device which requires a high level of privilege, usually access to the administrative interface.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity, which would suggest the attacker would need administrative privileges to achieve this. The CVSS vector indicates that the "PR:H" (Privileges Required: High).
- The advisory states the attacker does not need "User Interaction" "UI:N".
- The attack vector requires the attacker to be on the same local network "AV:A".
