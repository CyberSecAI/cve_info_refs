Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35496:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `bfd_pef_scan_start_address` function within the `bfd/pef.c` file of GNU Binutils. This occurs because the return value of `bfd_malloc` is not checked for NULL before being passed to `bfd_read()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing NULL pointer check: The code doesn't verify if `bfd_malloc` returns a valid memory address before dereferencing it via `bfd_read()`. If `bfd_malloc` fails and returns NULL, `bfd_read()` attempts to operate on a null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the application using the vulnerable binutils to crash by providing a crafted file that forces `bfd_malloc` to return NULL. This could lead to a disruption of service.
- Information Disclosure: Some sources indicate a possibility of sensitive information disclosure, though this is less emphasized than the DoS impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted file: The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted file is processed by objdump or any other tool that utilizes the affected `bfd_pef_scan_start_address` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted input file to a program utilizing the vulnerable version of GNU Binutils. No specific privilege is required, but the attacker must be able to execute the affected utility on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in GNU Binutils versions prior to 2.34.
- The fix involves adding a NULL check before calling `bfd_read()`.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.5.
