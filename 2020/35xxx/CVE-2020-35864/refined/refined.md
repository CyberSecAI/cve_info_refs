Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `read_scalar` and `read_scalar_at` functions in the `flatbuffers` crate allow for transmuting values from a byte slice to a scalar type without using `unsafe` blocks. This circumvents Rust's safety mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unsound Transmutation:** The functions allow arbitrary byte sequences to be reinterpreted as scalar types, even if those byte sequences do not represent valid values for the target type. This is similar to `transmute` in Rust, which is known to be unsafe.
*   **Dangling References:** By transmuting byte slices into types containing references (e.g., `&'static str`), the functions can create dangling references, which cause memory safety issues, like segmentation faults.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The transmutation can lead to undefined behavior when used with types where not all bit patterns are valid (e.g., `bool`, `NonZero*`).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Dangling references lead to memory corruption and potentially segmentation faults.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Transmuting invalid bit patterns into scalar types can lead to unpredictable behavior, which might affect program stability.
*   **Denial of Service (Availability High):**  The possibility of segmentation faults can lead to a crash, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `read_scalar` or `read_scalar_at` functions with crafted byte sequences. This can be done by an attacker who can control the data being deserialized.
*   Network-based attack vector according to CVSS vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the byte sequences that are passed to `read_scalar` or `read_scalar_at`.
*   No privileges or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   Attacker can be remote since the attack vector is over network according to CVSS vector.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported on March 20, 2020, and the advisory was issued on October 1, 2020.
*   The fix was released in version 2.0.0 of the crate.
*   The suggested fixes included making the functions `unsafe`, making the `EndianScalar` trait `unsafe`, or changing the trait to use functions that copy bytes instead of transmuting.
