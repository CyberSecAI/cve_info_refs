### Description

The `read_scalar` and `read_scalar_at` functions are unsound
because they allow transmuting values without `unsafe` blocks.

The following example shows how to create a dangling reference:

```
fn main() {
    #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
    struct S(&'static str);
    impl flatbuffers::EndianScalar for S {
        fn to_little_endian(self) -> Self { self }
        fn from_little_endian(self) -> Self { self }
    }
    println!("{:?}", flatbuffers::read_scalar::<S>(&[1; std::mem::size_of::<S>()]));
}

```

## Description

![@eduardosm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761151?u=b89a78a03ae69431bc81302b89a86638fed0e197&v=4&size=48)[eduardosm](https://github.com/eduardosm)opened [on Mar 20, 2020](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/5825#issue-585200387)

The `read_scalar` and `read_scalar_at` functions are unsound because the allow to do things such as:

```
flatbuffers::read_scalar::<bool>(&[3]));
```

or

```
fn main() {
    #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
    struct Nz(std::num::NonZeroI32);
    impl flatbuffers::EndianScalar for Nz {
        fn to_little_endian(self) -> Self { self }
        fn from_little_endian(self) -> Self { self }
    }
    println!("{:?}", flatbuffers::read_scalar::<Nz>(&[0, 0, 0, 0]));
}
```

or even worse:

```
fn main() {
    #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
    struct S(&'static str);
    impl flatbuffers::EndianScalar for S {
        fn to_little_endian(self) -> Self { self }
        fn from_little_endian(self) -> Self { self }
    }
    println!("{:?}", flatbuffers::read_scalar::<S>(&[1; std::mem::size_of::<S>()]));
}
```

(this last one causes a segmentation fault)

`read_scalar` is behaving similar to `transmute`, leading to undefined behavior for types where not all bit patterns are valid (such as `bool` or `NonZero*`) or allowing to create dangling pointers.

I suggest three breaking solutions:

* Make `read_scalar` and `read_scalar_at` functions unsafe.
* Make the `EndianScalar` trait unsafe.
* Make the `EndianScalar` trait something like:

```
pub trait EndianScalar {
    fn emplace_little_endian(self, buf: &mut [u8]);
    fn read_little_endian(buf: &[u8]) -> Self;
}
```

which, for example, would be implemented for `u32` like this:

```
impl EndianScalar for u32 {
    fn emplace_little_endian(self, buf: &mut [u8]) {
        buf[..4].copy_from_slice(&self.to_le_bytes());
    }
    fn read_little_endian(buf: &[u8]) -> u32 {
        u32::from_le_bytes([buf[0], buf[1], buf[2], buf[3]])
    }
}
```

This last solution, even though it is the most disrupting one, has the advantage of not requiring any `unsafe` at all.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
