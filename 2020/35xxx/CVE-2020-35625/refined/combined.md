# Description

Anyone with the ability to edit pages in the Widgets namespace can call any static function in any class defined in PHP or MediaWiki. Quite a few of these classes can do nefarious things, such as exfiltrate user data, change user passwords, read/write arbitrary files on the filesystem, or run arbitrary shell commands (running arbitrary shell commands or writing arbitrary files can both be used to achieve additional levels of code execution).

Proof of concept:

Page **Widget:Test** (requires 'editwidgets' permission to edit, by default only given to sysops and a "widget editors" group):

```
<!--{\MediaWiki\Shell\Shell::command('pwd')->execute()->getStdout()}-->
```

On some other page, invoking the widget via {{#widget:test}} will execute the above command on the shell and display the result on the page, in this case the current working directory that PHP is executing from (which is the root directory of the MediaWiki installation).

This extension is not deployed on WMF to the best of my knowledge but is deployed on a number of third-party wiki farms such as Fandom/Gamepedia.

The following patch should resolve the issue. I will submit this to gerrit (effectively making this issue public) once this is reviewed and relevant people are patched.

Ooops, I see that the patches are unmerged. I should have been more attentive. Now I officially published news about the issue without the fix in place. That's life I guess. In the future I personally would appreciate disclose only if the fix was merged. Otherwise I see no sense in doing so. Again this is just my personal opinion.

Yeah I was waiting until all of the backports were merged before asking for this task to be made public. I feel that it was made public a little bit too early as well. Backports to 1.31 and 1.35 have now been merged.

[@sbassett](/p/sbassett/) I know you were involved in the previous security issue with this extension ([T245850](/T245850)). Is there anything else we need to do for this one in order to get wiki admins notified, and do you think this merits a CVE?

Eh, once it's on gerrit, the whole world knows about it, so it's likely fine to make the related task public. The only times we (WMF) protect tasks are when:

1. something in core or a bundled ext/skin is being held for a future security release
2. folks are still in the process of disclosing a security issue and/or patch to relevant MediaWiki operators
3. there is some other legal reason we cannot publicly disclose a task

> [@sbassett](/p/sbassett/) I know you were involved in the previous security issue with this extension ([T245850](/T245850)). Is there anything else we need to do for this one in order to get wiki admins notified, and do you think this merits a CVE?

I can request a CVE for this one, sure. I'll update the task when I have this. And I'll definitely include this within the supplemental security release announcement ([T263810](/T263810)), due out in another week or so. Re: notifying - the [Security-Team](/tag/security-team/) would recommend a best-effort approach here, when those managing this issue feel they have done their best to contact affected MediaWiki operators.
