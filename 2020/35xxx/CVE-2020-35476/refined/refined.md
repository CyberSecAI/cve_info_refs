The provided content relates to CVE-2020-35476.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `yrange` parameter of OpenTSDB's graph generation functionality. Specifically, the application attempts to block backticks (`) but fails to account for other forms of command injection, like using `system()` function within the `gnuplot` context, resulting in command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The `yrange` parameter is vulnerable to command injection through the `gnuplot` library's `system()` function.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application attempts to block backticks but does not block other methods of command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting OpenTSDB, leading to potential system compromise, data breach, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack is performed through crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with a payload in the `yrange` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OpenTSDB instance. No authentication or other special privileges are required.
