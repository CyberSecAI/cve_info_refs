* `>=0.5.0`

### Description

`VecCopy::data` is created as a Vec of u8 but can be used to store and retrieve
elements of different types leading to misaligned access.

The issue was resolved in v0.5.0 by replacing data being stored by `Vec<u8>` with a custom managed
pointer. Elements are now stored and retrieved using types with proper alignment corresponding to
original types.

Hey there, I noticed that in `VecCopy` the backing storage for the Vec is a `u8`.

[dync/src/vec\_copy.rs](https://github.com/elrnv/dync/blob/c133056676582dd0e28c14526175d0c9ae01a905/src/vec_copy.rs#L64-L65)

Lines 64 to 65
in
[c133056](/elrnv/dync/commit/c133056676582dd0e28c14526175d0c9ae01a905)

|  | /// Raw data stored as bytes. |
| --- | --- |
|  | pub(crate) data: Vec<MaybeUninit<u8>>, |

I believe this let's you trigger undefined behavior in the form of misaligned memory access through safe rust code by instantiating a `VecCopy` with a type that has different alignment requirements from `u8`. Running the following program under [miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri):

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use dync::{VecCopy, VTable};

#[repr(align(256))]
#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct LargeAlign(u8);

impl VTable<LargeAlign> for LargeAlign {
    fn build_vtable() -> Self {
        LargeAlign(0)
    }
}

fn main() {
    // The backing storage for a VecCopy is a u8, meaning that casting to a type
    // with different alginment requires triggers undefined behavior.
    // https://github.com/elrnv/dync/blob/c133056676582dd0e28c14526175d0c9ae01a905/src/vec_copy.rs#L64-L65
    let mut x = VecCopy::<LargeAlign>::with_type();
    x.push_as::<LargeAlign>(LargeAlign(0));

    let _ref_to_element = x.get_ref_as::<LargeAlign>(0).unwrap();
}
```

results in:

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
