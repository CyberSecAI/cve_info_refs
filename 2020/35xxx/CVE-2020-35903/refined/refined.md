The content provided relates to CVE-2020-35903.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `VecCopy::data` field was implemented as a `Vec<u8>`, but it was used to store and retrieve elements of different types. This caused misaligned memory access, because types may have different alignment requirements than `u8`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Misaligned memory access due to storing data with different alignment requirements in a `Vec<u8>`.
- Undefined behavior due to accessing memory with incorrect alignment.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for program crashes or other undefined behavior due to misaligned memory access.
- Availability impact (High), as it can lead to program termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the code using the vulnerable `dync` crate.
