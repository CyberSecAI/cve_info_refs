Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary cause was the lack of proper permission checks on AJAX action endpoints within the PageLayer plugin. These endpoints were accessible to any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, rather than being restricted to users with the necessary capabilities.
*   Additionally, the plugin relied on a single nonce for authorization control, which was easily obtainable due to its exposure in the header section of the source code of any page edited with the PageLayer plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** AJAX endpoints lacked checks to ensure that the user making the request had the proper permissions.
*   **Nonce Disclosure:** A usable nonce, intended for CSRF protection, was exposed in the page's source code, enabling unauthenticated users to bypass CSRF protection and use AJAX actions.
*  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple vectors for stored XSS were present via the Button Widget (no sanitization) and ability to modify page content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete content on any page built with PageLayer and change a site's title.
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** By using the "Button" widget, or modifying settings, attackers could inject malicious JavaScript that would execute when users visited affected pages. This could result in:
    *   Creation of new administrative accounts.
    *   Redirection of site visitors to malicious sites.
    *   Exploitation of user browsers.
* **Template creation**: Attackers could create new page templates which resulted in new pages on the site and injecting malicious javascript.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers exploited the vulnerabilities remotely through the network.
*   **AJAX Requests:** The vulnerabilities were exploited by sending AJAX requests to affected endpoints.
*   **Compromised Nonce:** The exposed nonce was obtained from the page's source code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** For some vulnerabilities, the attacker needed to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, even with the lowest subscriber-level privileges.
*   **Unauthenticated User:** For some vulnerabilities,  an unauthenticated user could obtain the exposed nonce.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also discusses another related vulnerability, CVE-2020-35944, which is a CSRF vulnerability. However, this vulnerability is separate from CVE-2020-35947.
*   The vulnerabilities were present in versions <= 1.1.1 of the PageLayer plugin.
*   The vulnerabilities were patched in version 1.1.2 of the plugin.
*   The content includes a detailed timeline of the disclosure and patching process.
