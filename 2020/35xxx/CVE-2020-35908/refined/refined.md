Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `FuturesUnordered` struct in the `futures-util` crate had an incorrect `Sync` implementation. It used `Cell` for interior mutability of the `len` and `head_all` fields without proper synchronization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect `Sync` Implementation:** The `FuturesUnordered` structure was marked as `Sync`, indicating it could be safely accessed across threads. However, modifications to its internal state (specifically the length and head of the task list) were not synchronized.
- **Interior Mutability without Synchronization:** The use of `Cell` allowed mutable access to the internal fields, but without any form of locking or atomic operations, leading to data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** Concurrent modifications to the internal state by multiple threads could lead to incorrect values and thus corrupt the task list structure and behavior.
- **Unspecified behavior:** Could lead to unpredictable behavior due to the memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Multi-threaded environment:**  The vulnerability occurs when `FuturesUnordered` is used in a multithreaded context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and execute multiple threads that access and modify the same `FuturesUnordered` instance concurrently.
- No specific privileges or user interaction is required for the exploitation
- The attacker has to be able to influence how the futures are scheduled and inserted.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in version `0.3.2` of the `futures-util` crate by adding access synchronization around the insertion of tasks.
- The issue was initially reported in [rust-lang/futures-rs#2050](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2050) and also tracked as  `RUSTSEC-2020-0062`
- The CVSS score is 5.5 (MEDIUM) with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
