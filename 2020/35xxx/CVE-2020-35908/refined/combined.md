## Description

![@okready](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/423952?v=4&size=48)[okready](https://github.com/okready)opened [on Jan 24, 2020](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2050#issue-554994335)

`FuturesUnordered` switched to using `Cell` for interior mutability of the `len` and `head_all` fields in [47f3ccb](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/commit/47f3ccb0f7243a02a2258d5cf0942e892f3ac858), but it still currently retains a `Sync` implementation. Since there isn't any synchronization performed when these fields are modified when calling the `push` method, the `Sync` implementation is invalid and should be dropped.

It looks like this was mentioned in [#1669](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/1669), but was overlooked in the actual commit.

Affected Functions
Version
`futures_util::stream::FuturesUnordered`

* `>=0.3.0`

### Description

Affected versions of the crate had an unsound `Sync` implementation on the `FuturesUnordered` structure, which used a `Cell` for
interior mutability without any code to handle synchronized access to the underlying task list's length and head safely.

This could of lead to data corruption since two threads modifying the list at once could see incorrect values due to the lack
of access synchronization.

The issue was fixed by adding access synchronization code around insertion of tasks into the list.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
