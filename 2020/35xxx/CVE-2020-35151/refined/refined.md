Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-35151:

**Verification:**
The provided content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions "CVE-2020-35151" and describes an SQL injection vulnerability in the "Online Marriage Registration System 1.0", which aligns with the CVE ID. The provided code snippets and HTTP requests also correspond to SQL injection attacks against the described system and the vulnerable parameters.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `searchdata` POST parameter.
- Specifically, the application directly incorporates the `$_POST['searchdata']` variable into an SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- The vulnerable code is located in `omrs/user/search.php` and `omsr/admin/search.php`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a Time-Based SQL Injection. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server through crafted inputs to the `searchdata` parameter.
-  The application uses a direct string concatenation to build the SQL query making it vulnerable to injection. The use of a prepared statement does not prevent this because the `$sdata` parameter is concatenated in the query string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, marriage records, etc.
- **Data Manipulation:** It is also possible to modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data loss or service disruption.
- **Complete Compromise:** Depending on the database server's configuration and access rights, it may be possible for an attacker to gain complete control of the underlying database server or even the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `search.php` scripts (both user and admin versions).
- **`searchdata` Parameter:** The `searchdata` parameter within the POST request is the injection point.
- **Time-Based Injection:** The provided Proof of Concept uses a time-based injection technique `(select(sleep(5)))` to confirm the vulnerability. The injection forces the database to sleep, causing delays in the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target web application.
- **User Account (for user version):**  While the vulnerability exists in both admin and user versions of `search.php`, for the user version, it's mentioned that an attacker would need to create a user account to authenticate. However, the exploit-db entry clarifies that this is possible. For the admin version, it's implied that the attacker would need valid admin credentials, or exploit a different vulnerability for access.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable files: `omrs/user/search.php` and `omrs/admin/search.php`
- The vulnerable SQL query:
```sql
SELECT * from tblregistration where RegistrationNumber like '$sdata%' && UserID='$uid'
```
- The provided exploit uses a time-based SQL injection payload, e.g.:
```
' and (select 1 from (select(sleep(5)))a) and 'a'='a
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db entry provides specific details on how to trigger the SQL injection vulnerability, including the vulnerable request parameters and example HTTP requests.
- The entry highlights that the application is susceptible to Time Based SQL Injection, meaning that an attacker could leverage this to extract information from the database, character by character, by causing the application to delay its response.

In summary, the content provides a detailed description of an SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Marriage Registration System, with a clear explanation of the root cause, impact, and exploitation process. It confirms the relevance to CVE-2020-35151.
