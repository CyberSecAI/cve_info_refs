  "CVE-2020-35506": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter emulation of QEMU. It could occur in the esp_do_dma() function in hw/scsi/esp.c while handling the 'Information Transfer' command (CMD_TI). A privileged guest user may abuse this issue to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `esp_do_dma()` function of the am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter emulation within QEMU.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user can exploit this vulnerability to crash the QEMU process on the host, leading to a denial of service. There is also potential for code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the 'Information Transfer' command (CMD_TI) within the am53c974 SCSI device emulation.",
      "required_capabilities": "A privileged guest user is required to exploit this vulnerability."
