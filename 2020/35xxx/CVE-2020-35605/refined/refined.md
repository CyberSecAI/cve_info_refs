Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35605

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The kitty terminal emulator's graphics protocol implementation failed to properly sanitize filenames when returning an error message. Specifically, when an image file failed to load, the filename was included in the error message without being properly encoded or escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Input Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is input injection. By crafting a malicious filename containing shell commands embedded within escape sequences, an attacker could cause those commands to be executed when kitty attempted to display an image and subsequently returned an error message containing the malicious filename.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the filename before including it in the error message. This allows for arbitrary data, including executable commands, to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the user's system with the privileges of the user running kitty. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Filename:** The attacker crafts a filename that, when decoded by kitty, includes escape sequences and shell commands. The filename is then used in a graphics protocol request that fails.
- **Terminal Output:** The vulnerability is triggered when kitty attempts to display an image and fails. It then includes the crafted filename within an error message printed to the terminal. The escape sequences within the filename are interpreted as commands by the shell.
- **File Display:** The described exploit uses `cat` to display a text file containing the crafted escape sequences. Any mechanism that uses kitty to display the crafted string can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious File:**  The attacker needs to be able to create a file with the specially crafted filename.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to display a file with the crafted filename using kitty (e.g., via `cat`, or by triggering a display error in a different way).

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit example provided uses base64 encoding to embed commands into the filename, followed by an escape sequence to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the filename from the error message.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4819-1) indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in version 0.13.3-1+deb10u1 for the stable distribution (buster).
