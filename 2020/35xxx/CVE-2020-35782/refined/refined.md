The provided document is a security advisory for a missing function level access control vulnerability in several NETGEAR Smart Managed Plus Switches.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing function level access control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a missing function level access control, meaning that access to certain functionalities on the affected switches is not properly restricted, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a high impact to integrity and availability, but no impact to confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), indicating that the attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable device to exploit this. The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the affected switch (adjacent network) and requires no privileges (PR:N).

The advisory also provides the affected models and firmware versions:
*   JGS516PE, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.0.48
*   JGS524Ev2, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.0.48
*   JGS524PE, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.0.48
*  GS116Ev2, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.0.48
