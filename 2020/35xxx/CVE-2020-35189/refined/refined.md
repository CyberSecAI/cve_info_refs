Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The official Kong Docker images, specifically the Alpine variants prior to version 1.0.2-alpine, contained a blank password for the root user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Empty Password:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a blank password in the `/etc/shadow` file for the root user within the affected Docker images.
- This allows anyone to log in as root without any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the container, as the attacker gains root privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker with root access could potentially disrupt the services running within the container, leading to a denial of service.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability directly allows for privilege escalation to root within the container.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with root access could gain access to sensitive information or configurations within the container.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by connecting to the affected container.
- **Docker Image:** The vulnerability is inherent in the Kong Docker image itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the container running the vulnerable Kong Docker image.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of how to connect to and interact with a Docker container.
- **No Password Required:** The attacker doesn't need any credentials beyond the fact that no password is set.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of the Kong Docker image, all of which are Alpine based.
- The vulnerability is located in the `/etc/shadow` file which stores user account information, including password hashes.
- The discoverer of the vulnerability is "koharin".
