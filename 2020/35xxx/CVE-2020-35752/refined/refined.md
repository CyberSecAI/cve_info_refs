Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35752 (Although the exploit-db entry does not list a CVE, the information strongly suggests that this is the related vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Post title" parameter of the Baby Care System application. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code is saved in the database and executed when other users view the post.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode the "Post title" field, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript to steal the cookies of other users, potentially gaining access to their accounts.
- **Account Hijacking:** By stealing cookies, an attacker can effectively hijack accounts.
- **Malicious Actions:** The injected script can be used to perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the application.
- **"Post" feature:** The vulnerability is specifically located in the post creation/editing feature of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user with the ability to create or edit posts.
- **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.

**Detailed Steps to Reproduce (from Exploit-DB):**
1. Log in with a valid username and password.
2. Navigate to the "Post" tab on the left-hand side.
3. Add a new post and insert the payload `<audio src/onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` in the "Post title" parameter.
4. Click on the save button.
5. The XSS payload is now stored and will execute each time a user views the post, leading to cookie theft.
