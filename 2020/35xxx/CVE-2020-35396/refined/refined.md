    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Barcodes generator 1.0.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'name' parameter, before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

      "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript and submits it via the 'name' parameter when creating a new barcode.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to access the application and submit data to the barcode creation form. This could be via a web browser.",
        "additional_info": "The application is identified as 'Barcodes generator 1.0', available at http://egavilanmedia.com/barcodes-generator-using-php-mysql-and-jsbarcode-library/. The vulnerable parameter is 'name', and a sample payload is 'abc\"><script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>'. The exploit is also documented on Exploit-DB with ID 49227."
