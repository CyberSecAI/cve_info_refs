This document discloses a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document does not specify the root cause of the vulnerability, only that it is a "sensitive information disclosure security vulnerability".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability exists in the firmware of the listed NETGEAR router models.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is rated as "High" with a CVSS v3 score of 7.6, involving high Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts. The advisory states "sensitive information disclosure vulnerability".

**Attack vectors:** The CVSS v3 vector is AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. This means:
    -   **AV:P (Physical):** The attacker needs physical access to the device.
    -   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    -  **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    -   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required.
    -   **S:C (Changed):** The vulnerability affects components beyond the vulnerable component itself.
   - **C:H (High):** High impact to confidentiality.
    -   **I:H (High):** High impact to integrity.
    -   **A:H (High):** High impact to availability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the affected NETGEAR router and needs to use a method that does not require any authentication to trigger the sensitive information disclosure.
