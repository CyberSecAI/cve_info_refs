The new application-aware backup of Hyper-V VMs by the Agent for Hyper-V improves the backup and recovery of Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services running on Microsoft Hyper-V.

### Finalizing the virtual machine running from backup on Hyper-V

While a virtual machine is running from a backup, the virtual disks content is taken directly from its backup. Therefore, the machine will become inaccessible or even corrupted if the connection is lost to the backup location or to the backup agent. You have the option to make this machine permanent, that is, recover all of its virtual disks, along with the changes that occurred while the machine was running, to the datastore that stores these changes. This process is named finalization.

This process is now supported for both ESXi and Hyper-V.

## Known issues

This section describes issues that are currently known and provides solutions to avoid the issues where possible.

### Installation and upgrade

* [ABR-325252] Agent for Hyper-V cannot be re-registered on the management server via "Devices" â "Add" if it was successfully installed and removed before.

  Solution: restart the Acronis services on the agent before registration attempt.
* [ABR-312731] Chain upgrade sequence, such as Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 Update 5 â Acronis Cyber Protect 15 â Acronis Cyber Protect 15 Update 1 fails with "Error 0x430023: It is forbidden to use ''`"&?\*$<>;\/#{}' symbols in names." error if the tape pool contains special symbols in its name.
* [ABR-218875] When Acronis Cyber Protect 15 is uninstalled without using "Remove the logs and configuration settings" option and installed under new user, then new backup plans creation would fail with "Windows error: (0x80070005) Access is denied" error

  Solution: Uninstall Acronis Cyber Protect 15 without using "Remove the logs and configuration settings" option and install specifying the same existing user account which was used for the 1st initial installation.
* [ABR-217534] When the backup agent is installed using HTTP proxy it still requires that the hostnames of Acronis Cloud servers (for example "baas-fes-us3.acronis.com") are resolved properly from the agent side, even if DNS redirection is set up within the proxy server.
* [ABR-144289] Deployment of Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) from OVF template onto ESXi hosts versions 5.1 or lower produces VM with wrong guest OS type: "Other (32-bit)" which causes appliance malfunction.

  Solution: Change the guest OS type of the appliance VM to "Other 3.x or later Linux (64-bit)" via vSphere client.
* [ABR-143693] Deployment of Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) from OVF template does not work when using vSphere Web Client on vCenter version 6.5 U1 build 5973321, since this version of vCenter does not support deployment from OVF templates (only OVA format is supported)

  Solution: Prepare the virtual machine for Acronis Backup appliance installation manually as described in documentation and boot it from Acronis Backup appliance ISO to proceed with the installation.
* [ABR-142841] Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) ISO cannot boot on EFI systems

  Solution: use BIOS systems.
* [ABR-142560] Deployment of Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) from OVF template does not work when using vSphere Host Client on ESXi version 6.5 with error: "A required disk image was missing"

  Solution: Either perform OVF deployment using vSphere Web Client instead of vSphere Host Client OR prepare the virtual machine for Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) installation manually as described in documentation and boot it from Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) ISO to proceed with the installation.
* [ABR-131165] Simultaneous upgrade of multiple Virtual Appliances in the backup console is not possible.

  Solution: update Virtual Appliances one by one.
* [ABR-130409] A machine may not appear on the Devices tab after Acronis Backup agent installation if the Acronis Backup Management Server host name cannot be resolved to IP from the machine where the agent is installed. The following error message appears in the installation log: "Could not resolve host: [HOSTNAME]; Host not found".

  Solution: When deploying an agent to a machine use the new GUI option to define the management server registration address which will be used by the agent (host name or IP). Alternatively ensure that the management server is accessible by its host name from the machine with the agent.
* [ABR-130294] Updating or upgrading Agent for VMware (Virtual Appliance) that was encrypted by using vSphere 6.5 encryption fails. The following error appears: "An encrypted virtual disk device requires an encrypted virtual machine."

  Solution: Decrypt the appliance before update or upgrade.
* [ABR-118182] In some cases, installation may hang at 96% for an period of time up to 10-20 minutes because of the Microsoft.VC90.CRT runtime package installation. The main symptom is the Windows Modules Installer (TiWorker.exe) process constantly consuming CPU resources.

### Common

* [PLTFRM-18969] It is not possible to protect Microsoft SQL on a machine with a workstation operating system, in the case Agent for Hyper-V is also installed among local agents.
* [ABR-279757] Applying a protection plan to Agent for Windows installed on Windows Server 2008 (32 bit) always fails.

* [ABR-133689] Acronis MMS fails to start on the latest version of CentOS 7 that uses the 3.10.0-514.21.2.el7.x86\_64 kernel version, due to the specific kernel bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1463241.
* [ABR-128209] After unmounting a volume mounted from a backup in the read/write mode, a new recovery point is added, even if the mounted volume was not modified. The root cause is that Windows automatically discovers newly appeared volumes and applies metadata changes to them, which forces Acronis Backup 12.5 to preserve these changes in a new recovery point during unmounting.
* [ABR-127363] The cleanup rule By total size of backups is not available in the backup console if the backup destination is Acronis Cloud Storage.
* [ABR-121236] Exporting multiple plans from the Plans tab does not work.

* [ABR-129997] When creating a backup of a machine running macOS to a locally attached disk formatted in FAT32 or ExFAT, the backup might fail. The following error appears: "Operating system error: Resource temporarily unavailable."

  Solution: Format the disk with HFS+ and restart the backup.
* [ABR-129075] When browsing a folder in a backup during the file-level recovery via the service console, some child folders may not appear in the list after sorting by type if the folder contains many elements. To show all items of the folders, you need to scroll down in order to load the entire content of a parent folder and perform sorting only after that.
* [ABR-115270] The "[All Profiles Folder]" template in a file level backup does not support a custom profile path.
* [ABR-87244] File-level recovery from a disk/volume backup of NTFS volumes with the enabled native deduplication does not work.

### Acronis Storage Node, Acronis Storage and data catalog

IMPORTANT: Installation notes: Agent for Windows is always installed with Acronis Storage Node. The agent is required to browse the location contents.

* [DF-1502] In rare cases Catalog may show duplicate machine entries while browsing, if Acronis Storage Node and Acronis Catalog service are installed on different machines
* [DF-132] Recovery/Download of an item from catalog fails with "Unknown location: [name]" error after the backup location name was changed.
