Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for **CVE-2020-35934**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `aam/v1/authenticate` and `aam/v2/authenticate` REST endpoints in the Advanced Access Manager plugin. These endpoints, upon successful login, return a JSON-encoded response containing all user metadata, including hashed passwords, capabilities, roles, and any custom metadata. This excessive information disclosure occurs because the endpoints do not adequately restrict the data returned upon successful login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive user information through the REST API endpoints. This includes potentially sensitive data such as hashed passwords, user roles, capabilities, and custom metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker or low-privileged user could gain access to sensitive user information, which may include:
    *   Hashed passwords, which, if cracked, would allow for unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   User roles and capabilities, providing attackers with information to plan further attacks and identify potential privilege escalation paths.
    *   Custom metadata that could include sensitive configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **REST API Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the `aam/v1/authenticate` and `aam/v2/authenticate` REST endpoints. An attacker would need to successfully log in through these endpoints to trigger the information disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** An attacker needs to have valid user credentials to make a successful authentication request to the vulnerable REST endpoints.
*   **Network Access:** Ability to send requests to the REST API endpoints of the affected WordPress installation.

**Additional Notes:**
* The Wordfence article identifies this vulnerability as a medium-severity issue (CVSS score of 4.3).
* The identified vulnerable versions are prior to 6.6.2 of the Advanced Access Manager plugin.
* The related vulnerability, **CVE-2020-35935**, is an authorization bypass that could lead to privilege escalation and was fixed in the same release (6.6.2).
