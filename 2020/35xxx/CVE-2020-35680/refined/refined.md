Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35680:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A logic error in the OpenSMTPD filters state machine. This error leads to premature release of the IO channel between the SMTP engine and the filter layer while filters are still processing a request, resulting in a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Use-after-free: The IO channel between the SMTP engine and filters is released, but filters try to access it afterwards, leading to a crash due to accessing freed memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the OpenSMTPD daemon to crash by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**

- Remote: A remote attacker can connect to the SMTP listener daemon and trigger the vulnerability by crafting a specific pattern of client activity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the SMTP service and send commands to trigger the vulnerable code path. The attacker needs to be able to send a specific pattern of commands to trigger the race condition.

**Additional notes:**
  - The vulnerability is triggered by a specific client interaction pattern.
  - The vulnerability is fixed in OpenSMTPD version 6.8.0p2.
