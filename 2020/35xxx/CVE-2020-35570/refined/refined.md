The root cause is a lack of proper access controls, allowing direct requests or "forced browsing" to access files that should be restricted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Direct Request (Forced Browsing) [CWE-425]
- Incomplete fix for the vulnerability in prior versions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to files that should be restricted, leading to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker crafts specific requests to access restricted files directly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-35570 describes a vulnerability in MB connect line mymbCONNECT24, mbCONNECT24, and Helmholz myREX24 and myREX24.virtual. The software fails to properly restrict access to files, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access restricted files through forced browsing. This could expose sensitive information to the attacker.
