Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) within the HA (High Availability) module of the affected software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-controlled input when making requests to internal or external resources. This allows an attacker to manipulate the request to make the server initiate connections to arbitrary hosts and ports.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Port Scanning:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the SSRF to scan for open ports on the internal network where the vulnerable software is deployed. This could potentially reveal information about other services running on the network and aid in further attacks. The vulnerability allows an attacker to scan for open ports, potentially on an internal network that is not otherwise directly accessible to them.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They can send malicious requests directly to the vulnerable component.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target system.

**Summary of CVE-2020-35561**

This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to scan for open ports on the network by exploiting a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability in the HA module.
