Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-35716:

**CVE-2020-35716: Persistent webui DOS potentially exploitable**

*   **Root Cause:** An unauthenticated POST request to `/goform/langSwitch` with a very long string in the `langSelectionOnly` parameter (specifically, 3894 characters) triggers a segmentation fault. The lack of input validation on the length of the `langSelectionOnly` parameter is the core issue.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault caused by an overly long string in an HTTP POST parameter. The lack of input validation on the `langSelectionOnly` parameter allows an attacker to cause the crash.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a soft "bricking" of the device, rendering the web interface inaccessible. The device remains unusable until a physical reset is performed. The blog post also mentions that this DoS may be exploitable for further attacks, though this is not detailed.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is an unauthenticated HTTP POST request to the `/goform/langSwitch` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be located remotely (assuming the device is accessible over the network). They only need the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post mentions that a string of 3894 characters in the `langSelectionOnly` parameter is enough to trigger the segmentation fault.
*   The blog author mentions this vulnerability might be exploitable but requires more investigation.
*   The vulnerability is present in Linksys RE6500 range extenders.
*   The bug was reported to Belkin, the maker of Linksys products.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 7.5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in firmware version v1.0.11.001 (released Feb 20, 2020).
