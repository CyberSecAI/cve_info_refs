## Description

![@sebzim4500](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117028?v=4&size=48)[sebzim4500](https://github.com/sebzim4500)opened [on Jan 30, 2020](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/issues/91#issue-557529600)

The following code segfaults, due to incorrect pinning in `Framed`.

```
use futures::task::{noop_waker, Context, Poll};
use actix_codec::{Framed, AsyncRead, BytesCodec, AsyncWrite};
use std::pin::Pin;
use futures::io::Error;
use std::future::Future;
use pin_project::pin_project;

#[pin_project]
struct FakeSocket<F> {
    #[pin]
    inner: F
}

impl<F: Future> AsyncRead for FakeSocket<F> {
    fn poll_read(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Poll<Result<usize, Error>> {
        self.project().inner.poll(cx).map(|x| Ok(0))
    }
}

impl<F> AsyncWrite for FakeSocket<F> {
    fn poll_write(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>, buf: &[u8]) -> Poll<Result<usize, Error>> {
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn poll_flush(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Result<(), Error>> {
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn poll_shutdown(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Result<(), Error>> {
        unimplemented!()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = futures::channel::oneshot::channel();
    let mut framed: Result<_, [u8; 32]> = Ok(Framed::new(FakeSocket {
        inner: async {
            let x = Box::new(0);
            let y = &x;
            receiver.await.unwrap();
            let z = **y;
        }
    }, BytesCodec));

    let waker = noop_waker();
    let mut context = Context::from_waker(&waker);

    framed.as_mut().unwrap().next_item(&mut context);
    sender.send(()).unwrap();
    let _ = std::mem::replace(&mut framed, Err([0; 32])).unwrap().next_item(&mut context);
}
```

Patched

* `>=0.3.0-beta.1`

### Description

Affected versions of this crate did not require the buffer wrapped in `Framed` to be pinned,
but treated it as if it had a fixed location in memory. This may result in a use-after-free.

The flaw was corrected by making the affected functions accept `Pin<&mut Self>` instead of `&mut self`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
