Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Framed` struct in the `actix-codec` crate not properly handling the pinning of the underlying buffer. It was treating the buffer as if it had a fixed location in memory, even though it could be moved.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Use-after-free:** The lack of pinning allowed the buffer to be moved in memory while `Framed` still held a pointer to its old location. This led to a use-after-free condition when `Framed` attempted to access the buffer at its old location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** A use-after-free can lead to memory corruption.
- **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause memory corruption which can lead to complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special privileges or user interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring user interaction or special privileges. The attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details:**
- The `Framed` struct in `actix-codec` did not enforce pinning of the underlying buffer, which meant the buffer could be moved in memory. When `Framed` then tried to access the buffer at its old location after it was moved, this resulted in a use-after-free.
- The fix was to modify the affected functions to accept `Pin<&mut Self>` instead of `&mut self` , requiring the buffer to be pinned in memory.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `actix-codec` prior to `0.3.0-beta.1`.
- The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical).
- The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2020-35902 and GHSA-rqgx-hpg4-456r.
