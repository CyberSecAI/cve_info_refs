Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-35502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from memory leaks that occur in Privoxy when a response is buffered. These leaks are triggered when the buffer limit is reached or when Privoxy is running out of memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leaks:** The core issue is the presence of memory leaks in the response buffering mechanism. This means that memory allocated for buffering responses is not properly released when the buffer is full or when memory is scarce.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a potential Denial of Service. Accumulating memory leaks can lead to a system crash as the available memory is exhausted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves sending requests to Privoxy that elicit a buffered response. Specifically, the memory leak occurs if the response is buffered, and if the buffer limit is reached, or if Privoxy is running out of memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Privoxy instance. There is no need for any prior authentication or privileged access.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The fix for this vulnerability was implemented through commits `bbd53f1010b` and `4490d451f9b`. These commits are directly referenced in the description of the bug fix.
*   The vulnerability is mentioned in the Privoxy 3.0.29 changelog as a "Security/Reliability" fix.
*   The advisory from Gentoo states that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, which reinforces that no specific position or privileged access is needed for an attacker.
* The Bugzilla entry indicates that this CVE was for community support and did not affect a commercially supported Red Hat product, however it did affect Fedora and EPEL.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-35502 describes a memory leak vulnerability in Privoxy's response buffering mechanism. This vulnerability can be triggered by sending requests that cause buffered responses and can lead to a denial-of-service condition if the memory leaks are left unmanaged. The vulnerability was addressed in Privoxy version 3.0.29 with two specific commits.
