Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35927:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `thex::Thex<T>` type in the `thex` crate for Rust incorrectly implements the `Sync` trait for all types `T` without requiring `T` to also implement the `Send` trait. This allows non-`Send` types to be used in multi-threaded contexts where they are not designed to be safely accessed, leading to data races.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data races:** The core issue is the potential for data races due to sharing non-`Send` types across threads.
- **Incorrect `Sync` implementation:** The `thex::Thex<T>` type incorrectly claims to be thread-safe for all types, which violates Rust's safety guarantees.
- **Memory corruption and undefined behavior:** The direct consequence of data races of non-Send types is memory corruption and undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Availability impact:** High, the data races can lead to program crashes and unpredictable behavior, causing a denial of service
- **Confidentiality and Integrity impact:**  None. The vulnerability does not directly allow for leaking information or modification of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to execute code on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low privileges:** The attacker only requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No user interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code that can create multiple threads and use the vulnerable `thex` crate.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `Send` trait in Rust indicates that a type is safe to be transferred between threads. Types that do not implement `Send` are not thread safe.
- The advisory mentions that `Rc` (reference-counted pointer) is an example of a non-`Send` type.
- The vulnerability was present in version `0.1.0` of the crate.
- No patched version exists according to the advisory
- CVSS score of 5.5 was assigned (Moderate Severity)
