The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35937.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `team_import_xml_layouts` function in the Team Showcase plugin deserializes data from a user-controlled source (`source` parameter) without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **PHP Object Injection:** The vulnerable function uses `unserialize()` on user-provided data, allowing for the injection of arbitrary PHP objects. If a vulnerable magic method exists within the WordPress installation (e.g., in another installed plugin), this can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code, write/delete files, and potentially take over the site by injecting malicious PHP objects.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker sends an AJAX request with the `action` set to `team_import_xml_layouts`, along with a crafted `source` parameter pointing to a malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to trigger the vulnerable function via AJAX request.
*   The vulnerability could also be exploited by unauthenticated users if a 3rd party plugin or theme allows execution of shortcodes without authentication.
