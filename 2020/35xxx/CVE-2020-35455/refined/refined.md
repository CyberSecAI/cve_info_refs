Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure data storage practices within the Taidii Diibear Android application. Specifically, the application stores sensitive data in plaintext within two locations:

1.  **Shared Preferences:** This storage mechanism is intended for simple key-value pairs, but the application inappropriately stores sensitive information here in plaintext.
2.  **SQLite Database:** Similar to the Shared Preferences issue, the application stores sensitive data directly in plaintext within its SQLite database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Data Storage:** The core weakness is the storage of sensitive data (user credentials, authentication tokens, personal data, etc.) in plaintext. This violates fundamental security principles of data protection.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** Data stored in both Shared Preferences and the SQLite database are not encrypted, making them easily accessible to unauthorized parties with sufficient access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Account Compromise:** An attacker who gains access to the plaintext credentials and tokens can use them to gain full access to the victim's account, allowing them to impersonate the user and perform any actions they could.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Personal Information:** The plaintext personal data disclosed includes student profile pictures, birth regions, dates of birth, names, gender, and other personally identifiable information. This exposure could result in identity theft, privacy violations, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local read/write access to the device where the application is installed. This means that an attacker who has physical access to the phone or can otherwise gain access to the device's file system can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Read/Write Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read from and write to the device's storage, meaning they either have physical access or have achieved a form of compromise that grants them access to the file system.
*   **No Prior App Access Required:** The attacker does not need to have an account or any prior access to the app. They can directly extract sensitive information from the device's storage.

**Summary of CVE-2020-35455**

The application stores sensitive user credentials and personal data in plaintext in both Shared Preferences and an SQLite database. An attacker with local access to the device can read this data and fully compromise user accounts.
