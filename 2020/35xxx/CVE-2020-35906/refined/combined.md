[Dependabot alerts

## Package

cargo

futures-task
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.2.1, < 0.3.6

## Patched versions

0.3.6

## Description

Affected versions of the crate did not properly implement a 'static lifetime bound on the waker function. This resulted in a use-after-free if Waker::wake() is called after original data had been dropped.

The flaw was corrected by adding 'static lifetime bound to the data waker takes.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @Darksonn **[Darksonn](/Darksonn)** commented [Sep 2, 2020](#issue-690899005)

The `futures::task::waker` function currently allows you to transmute an `Arc<T>` into a `Waker`, even if `T` is not `'static`. This can cause an use-after-free.

```
use std::sync::Arc;
use futures::task::{waker, ArcWake};

struct MyRef<'a> {
    a: &'a str,
}

impl<'a> ArcWake for MyRef<'a> {
    fn wake_by_ref(arc_self: &Arc<Self>) {
        println!("{}", arc_self.a);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let string = "Hello World!".to_string();
    let waker = waker(Arc::new(MyRef { a: &string }));
    drop(string);
    waker.wake(); // This causes an use-after-free of the string.
}
```
