Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `futures_task::waker` function in the `futures-task` crate did not enforce a `'static` lifetime bound on the data it used to create a `Waker`. This allowed creating a `Waker` from a non-`'static` type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** When `Waker::wake()` was called after the original data (pointed to by the non-'static lifetime) had been dropped, it resulted in a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free could lead to arbitrary code execution and memory corruption due to accessing freed memory.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** As indicated by the CVSS score, this could have a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** As the attack vector is marked as "Local", it would likely be exploited by manipulating the program within the same system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker would require low privileges on the system where the vulnerable code is running.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack doesn't require any user interaction, implying that it could be automated or occur without direct engagement from a user.

**Technical Details:**
* The `waker` function allowed transmuting an `Arc<T>` into a `Waker` even if T was not `'static`.
* The fix was to add a `'static` lifetime bound to the data the `waker` takes.

**Affected Versions:**

*   `>= 0.2.1` and `< 0.3.6` of the `futures-task` crate were affected.

**Patched Versions:**
*   `0.3.6` and later versions of the `futures-task` crate include the fix.
