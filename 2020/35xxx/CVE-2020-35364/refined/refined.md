Based on the provided code, the vulnerability is related to DLL hijacking.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The provided C++ code attempts to exploit a DLL hijacking vulnerability in Huorong's `HipsTray.exe` by creating the process with a malicious DLL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The code uses `DetourCreateProcessWithDllA` to launch `HipsTray.exe` with a custom DLL (`Hijack.dll`). If `HipsTray.exe` loads DLLs from the same directory, it will load the attacker-controlled DLL instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The malicious DLL (`Hijack.dll`) executed within the context of `HipsTray.exe`, which likely runs with elevated privileges. The code's objective is to add the current user to the Administrators group. This action results in privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local execution:** The attacker must be able to place the malicious DLL (`Hijack.dll`) in the same directory as `PoC.exe` and execute `PoC.exe`. The code itself is designed to target a specific vulnerable application (HipsTray.exe), so it must exist on the target machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to write files to a location where a vulnerable application is present. They also need the ability to execute code.
