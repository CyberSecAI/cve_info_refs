* Your Link Lock block page can now be customized to include your own logo, header and messaging.
* Customers can now opt to have Link Lock follow redirected URLs, protecting against the commonly used phishing technique of URL redirection.

* ANTISPOOF\_NAME now supports UTF8 encoding.
* White space is being correctly handled in the display name for Anti-Spoof.
* Fuzzy matching deals with display names more accurately.

* ANTISPOOF\_NAME triggering correctly for name-spoofed mails.
* Anti-spoof logic is enhanced to achieve some performance benefits.
* Fuzzy matching score increased to ensure the rule has impact.

The following improvements have been made to Link Lock:

* Multiple issues causing broken URLs have been resolved.
* Improved handling of URLs related to certain chars, including '|', space & Unicode.
* Improved how Link Lock aproaches URLs in HTML <a> and <base> tags.

  + Removed potential for CSV injection vulnerability in the History page.
* New rules were pushed out to manage spam mails.

![spamtitan-logo-small.jpg](image/uuid-866dba50-893e-0334-1dec-6127326c9dbe.jpg)
#### SpamTitan 7.12

*Released December 2021*

**What's new?**

* SpamTitan now includes Link Lock, which provides protection against phishing, business email compromise, and zero day attacks by removing the possibility of a user clicking on a malicious link in an email. SpamTitan does this by rewriting all links in every email. Subsequently, when a link is clicked, SpamTitan can verify if the destination URL is safe or malicious. If the link is malicious, the user is presented with a block page indicating that there is a security risk.

  With Link Lock, links always remain rewritten, ensuring that if a malicious email is forwarded to other employees within your company, or to other firms with which you do business, those recipients are also protected. Links are checked in real-time once clicked.

  SpamTitan allows you to exclude URLs from Link Lock by adding them to an allowed URLs list, which can be done at the global, domain and user levels. See [Link Lock](https://docs.titanhq.com/en/30209-link-lock.html) for more information.

  Link Lock is an enhancement to SpamTitan and is available after the purchase of a SpamTitan Plus license. If you wish to purchase a SpamTitan Plus license, please contact your Account Manager or email sales@titanhq.com.

#### SpamTitan 7.11

*Released September 2021*

**What's new?**

* SpamTitan now includes Geoblocking, allowing you to restrict email based on a sender's geographic location. Our Geoblocking functionality enables you to define rules that allow you to restrict email from a selected country. It also allows exemptions to geoblocking rules in order to exclude mail based on a sender's IP, domain, or email address.

  Geoblocking can be enabled or disabled at a global level and once enabled, it can be managed at the admin, domain group, domain, and user levels. See [Geoblocking](https://docs.titanhq.com/en/29111-geoblocking.html) for more information.

**What has been improved?**

* The Bitdefender software developer kit (SDK) has been upgraded to version 3.0.1, offering improvements to sandboxing and pre-filtering.
