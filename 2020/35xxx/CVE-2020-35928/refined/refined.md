Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `concread` crate incorrectly implemented the `Send` and `Sync` traits for the `ARCache<K, V>` type. It did not enforce that the type parameter `V` must also implement `Send` and `Sync`. This allowed users to insert non-thread-safe types (types that do not implement `Send` and `Sync`) into the `ARCache` and share them across multiple threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing `Send` and `Sync` bounds:** The `Send` and `Sync` trait implementations for `ARCache<K, V>` lacked the necessary bounds on the `V` type parameter, which would have ensured that `V` is thread-safe.
- **Data race:**  By allowing non-`Send`/`Sync` types to be used within the `ARCache` across threads, the code was vulnerable to data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined behavior:** Sharing non-thread-safe data across multiple threads leads to data races, potentially resulting in unpredictable behavior such as memory corruption, crashes, and other undefined behavior. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates this with a shared `Rc` counter that could result in a panic due to memory leaks or a crash due to illegal instruction.
- **Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a high impact on availability as it can cause the program to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, implying an attacker needs local access to the machine or application running the affected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction.
- **High Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered high, likely due to the specific conditions needed to trigger the data race.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding the necessary `Send` and `Sync` bounds to the `V` type parameter in the `Send` and `Sync` implementations for `ARCache<K, V>`.
- The provided proof of concept uses `Rc` (Reference Counted) which is not `Send` nor `Sync`, which when cloned and dropped in multiple threads results in data races and undefined behavior.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the `concread` crate prior to 0.2.6.
- CVSS Score: 4.7 (MEDIUM)
