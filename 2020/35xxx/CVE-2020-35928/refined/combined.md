* `>=0.2.6`

### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send`/`Sync` traits for `ARCache<K, V>` type.

This allows users to send/access types that do not implement `Send`/`Sync`, which can cause a data race.

The flaw was corrected in the 0.2.6 release by adding bounds `K: Send + Sync` & `V: Send + Sync` to affected `Send`/`Sync` trait implementations.

## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Nov 13, 2020](https://github.com/kanidm/concread/issues/48#issue-742825697)

Hello! 🦀

While scanning crates.io., we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) have noticed a soundness/memory safety issue in this crate which allows safe Rust code to trigger undefined behavior.

## Issue

Currently `Send` & `Sync` for `ARCache<K, V>` is implemented as below.

```
unsafe impl<K: Hash + Eq + Ord + Clone + Debug, V: Clone + Debug> Send for ARCache<K, V> {}
unsafe impl<K: Hash + Eq + Ord + Clone + Debug, V: Clone + Debug> Sync for ARCache<K, V> {}
```

In the `Send` impl, there is no `Send` bound on `V`. In the `Sync` impl, there is no `Sync` bound on `V`.

It is possible to insert a non-Sync item to `ARCache` and share it across multiple threads.

## Proof of Concept

I wrote a minimal proof-of-concept that exploits this issue to cause undefined behavior in safe Rust.

To observe undefined behavior, you need to run the below program in Debug mode.

In the program below, multiple threads clone & drop `Rc`(**neither `Send` nor `Sync`**) which is inside `ARCache`.

Since `Rc`'s internal `strong_count` is updated by multiple threads without synchronization,

the program will terminate in either one of the following states.

* **`strong_count` > 1**
  + program panics at the assertion check at the end (memory leak)
* **`strong_count` == 0**
  + `Rc` is dropped while references to it are still alive.

    When run on Ubuntu 18.04, program crashes with error: `Illegal Instruction (Core Dumped)`
* **`strong_count` == 1**
  + Not impossible, but highly unlikely

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
use concread::arcache::ARCache;

use std::sync::Arc;
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let non_sync_item = Rc::new(0); // neither `Send` nor `Sync`
    assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&non_sync_item), 1);

    let cache = ARCache::<i32, Rc<u64>>::new_size(5, 5);
    let mut writer = cache.write();
    writer.insert(0, non_sync_item);
    writer.commit();

    let arc_parent = Arc::new(cache);

    let mut handles = vec![];
    for _ in 0..5 {
        let arc_child = arc_parent.clone();
        let child_handle = std::thread::spawn(move || {
            let reader = arc_child.read(); // new Reader of ARCache
            let smuggled_rc = reader.get(&0).unwrap();

            for _ in 0..1000 {
                let _dummy_clone = Rc::clone(&smuggled_rc); // Increment `strong_count` of `Rc`
                // When `_dummy_clone` is dropped, `strong_count` is decremented.
            }
        });
        handles.push(child_handle);
    }
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().expect("failed to join child thread");
    }

    assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(arc_parent.read().get(&0).unwrap()), 1);
}
```
## How to fix the issue?

I think this issue can be solved by adding `Send/Sync` bounds to the current `Send/Sync` impls as below.

```
// Added `Send` bound to `V`
unsafe impl<K: Hash + Eq + Ord + Clone + Debug, V: Clone + Debug + Send> Send for ARCache<K, V> {}
// Added `Sync` bound to `V`
unsafe impl<K: Hash + Eq + Ord + Clone + Debug, V: Clone + Debug + Sync> Sync for ARCache<K, V> {}
```

Thank you for checking out this issue! 👍 🐱

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
