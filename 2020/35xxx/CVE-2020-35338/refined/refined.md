Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35338:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of a default administrative account with a hardcoded password ("pokon") within the WMT Playout Server's Web Administrative Interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Default Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of default, easily guessable credentials for a high-privilege account.
- **Lack of Authentication Enforcement:** The system does not enforce a strong password policy or require users to change the default credentials upon initial setup.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable interface allows an unauthenticated user to attempt login with the default credentials remotely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit grants an attacker full administrative access to the WMT Playout Server.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can read and modify system data, including configurations of affected devices.
- **Device Control:** Attackers can control the device remotely.
- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full administrative rights over the device, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Increased Severity:** The ease of exploitation and the level of access gained increases the severity of the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the web administrative interface, without the need for local access or other prerequisites.
- **Credential Stuffing:** The attacker simply needs to enter the hardcoded default password.
- **Web Interface Login:** The attack vector is through the login page of the WMT Playout Server's Web Administrative Interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target system.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the default username (blank) and password ("pokon") to exploit the vulnerability. No other specific capabilities or positioning are mentioned.
- **Basic Web Interaction Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface and input credentials.
