Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Asterisk handles `tel-uri` (telephone URIs) within SIP headers, specifically `Diversion` and `History-Info` headers. When a SIP message contains either a `Diversion` header in a 181 response or a `History-Info` header, and the header includes a `tel-uri`, Asterisk can crash. The underlying issue is the lack of proper handling of tel-uri within those headers in `res_pjsip_diversion.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is that the Asterisk module `res_pjsip_diversion.c` does not properly validate or handle `tel-uri` when present in `Diversion` or `History-Info` SIP headers.
*   **Crash Vulnerability:** This leads to a crash when a SIP message with a `tel-uri` in the specified headers is processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the Asterisk service, causing a denial of service. This can disrupt phone services and communication relying on the Asterisk system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attacks:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted SIP messages, sent remotely.
*   **SIP Messaging:** Attackers can send SIP messages containing the malicious headers to vulnerable Asterisk instances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Asterisk server.
*   **Authenticated Session (or Anonymous Calling):** For `History-Info` header related issue (AST-2020-003), the attacker needs to be either authenticated with the Asterisk server or the Asterisk server must be configured to allow anonymous calling. For the `Diversion` header related issue (AST-2020-004), the requirement is that the attacker must be able to send a SIP message with a 181 response with a crafted `Diversion` header including the `tel-uri`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue related to the `Diversion` header was reported by Mikhail Ivanov and is tracked as ASTERISK-29191
*   The issue related to the `History-Info` header was reported by Torrey Searle and is tracked as ASTERISK-29219
*   Both issues are related and fixed by the same patches, per the advisory AST-2020-004.
*   The advisory AST-2020-003 indicates that exploits for the History-Info issue were already known.
*   The provided information gives a detailed view of the vulnerability, including the specific headers, URI schemes, and affected code modules.

In summary, CVE-2020-35652 describes a vulnerability in Asterisk that can be exploited through crafted SIP messages, resulting in a denial-of-service. The vulnerability resides in the `res_pjsip_diversion.c` module, due to improper handling of `tel-uri` in `Diversion` and `History-Info` headers.
