Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35737:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2020-35737, confirms its association with Newgen's Correspondence Management System (corms) eGov 12.0, and describes the vulnerability. The exploit-db entry explicitly mentions the CVE ID. Thus, the content is relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the `UserIndex` parameter in the personal settings page of the application. This allows for an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses direct references to internal implementation objects (user accounts) without proper authorization checks. By manipulating the `UserIndex` parameter, an attacker can access and modify the personal information of other users.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not validate the `UserIndex` parameter to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to access the profile associated with the given index.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view the personal information of other users.
    *   **Escalation of Privileges:** Attackers can effectively gain access to and modify the profiles of other users, although not gaining full admin access.
    *   **Code Execution:** The provided information doesn't explicitly state code execution is possible, but the ability to modify user profiles can be a starting point for other attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker manipulates the `UserIndex` parameter in the URL or request parameters while navigating the application.
    *   The vulnerable URL is specifically identified as `http://server/corms/dist/#/web/home/workdesk/inbox`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
    *   The attacker needs to identify the UserIndex of other users.
    *   No special privileges are required for the attack.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Newgen Correspondence Management System (corms) eGov version 12.0
*   The system was tested on JBoss EAP 7.

**4. Summary:**

CVE-2020-35737 is an IDOR vulnerability in Newgen's Correspondence Management System (corms) eGov 12.0 that allows an authenticated user to access and modify the personal information of other users by manipulating the `UserIndex` parameter. This can lead to information disclosure and potential manipulation of user accounts.

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a good overview of the vulnerability and its exploitation.
*   The provided information confirms the vendor's acknowledgment of the vulnerability.
