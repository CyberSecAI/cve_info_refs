Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper verification when deleting files uploaded through the Quiz and Survey Master plugin. The `qsm_remove_file_fd_question` function, which is intended to remove uploaded files, does not check if the provided `file_url` belongs to an actual quiz/survey upload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Deletion:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to trigger the file deletion function by exploiting the `wp_ajax_nopriv_qsm_remove_file_fd_question` action.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is no validation or check on the `file_url` parameter before calling `wp_delete_file()`, enabling the deletion of arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete any file on the web server accessible by the WordPress process by supplying the file path via the `file_url` parameter.
*   **Denial of Service:** Deleting crucial files like `wp-config.php` can render the website unusable, potentially leading to a complete site takeover if the attacker can re-install WordPress using their own database configurations.
*   **Potential Site Compromise:** By deleting configuration files, attackers can take control of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated AJAX Call:** The `qsm_remove_file_fd_question` AJAX action is accessible to unauthenticated users (via `wp_ajax_nopriv_`), making it easy for anyone to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** The `file_url` parameter can be manipulated by an attacker to target any file on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication is required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress website.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site's server.
*  **Knowledge of file paths:** The attacker needs to know the file paths of the files they wish to delete.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content also mentions a related arbitrary file upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-35949), but this analysis focuses on CVE-2020-35951.
* The Wordfence article clarifies that this file deletion vulnerability is always exploitable, regardless of whether or not the site has quizzes accepting uploads enabled.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 7.0.1 of the Quiz and Survey Master plugin.
