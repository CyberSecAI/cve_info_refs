The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is identified as PSV-2018-0499. While it does not mention CVE-2020-35837 specifically, the provided document describes a vulnerability which matches the general description of a Stored XSS.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability present in the web interface of the affected NETGEAR routers. This means that malicious script can be stored persistently within the router's configuration and later executed in the browsers of users accessing the interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the router's web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of successful exploitation can include:
  - Account hijacking: An attacker could potentially steal user credentials (session cookies) and gain unauthorized access to router settings and network configurations.
  - Malicious actions: An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites, modify router settings, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the router's administrator.
  - Information disclosure: An attacker may be able to access sensitive data stored on the router.
  - The document mentions that NETGEAR is not responsible for consequences that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into input fields or configuration parameters of the router's web interface, which are later rendered when other users access the same interface. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would likely need to be able to access and modify the router's web interface, suggesting they would need to be on the same local network as the router or have compromised administrative access to the router. The advisory notes CVSSv3 vector is  `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N` meaning that the attacker needs Adjacent Access (AV:A) with Low complexity (AC:L) and High Privileges (PR:H). User interaction is not required for exploitation (UI:N).
- The advisory does not specify which exact fields or configuration parameters are vulnerable, it is recommended that the router is upgraded to the latest version.
