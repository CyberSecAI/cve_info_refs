  "cve": "CVE-2020-35505",
  "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter emulation of QEMU. This issue occurs while handling the 'Information Transfer' command in the do_busid_cmd() function in hw/scsi/esp.c. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "affected_components": [
    "am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter emulation of QEMU"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The `do_busid_cmd()` function in `hw/scsi/esp.c` does not ensure that `s->current_dev` is a valid pointer to a `SCSIDevice`. This pointer is later dereferenced to access `s->current_dev->id` when finding a SCSI device through `scsi_device_find()`, leading to a NULL pointer dereference if `s->current_dev` is NULL.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "NULL pointer dereference"
  ],
  "impact": "Denial of service. A privileged guest user can crash the QEMU process on the host.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "A privileged guest user sends a specific command ('Information Transfer' command or CMD_TI) to the emulated am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter that triggers the NULL pointer dereference in the `do_busid_cmd()` function."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
     "The attacker must have a privileged user account within the guest operating system.",
    "The attacker must be able to send commands to the emulated am53c974 SCSI host bus adapter."
   ],
  "additional_details": [
    "The issue was fixed by a patch series which addressed multiple issues in the ESP emulation.",
    "Specific commit strictly needed for the fix: https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=99545751734035b76bd372c4e7215bb337428d89"
