  "CVE-2020-35850": {
    "Description": "An unauthenticated user can detect open ssh port or another open ports on server that services Cockpit. This vulnerability allows a user to send requests to internal hosts for detecting open ports, potentially bypassing firewall configurations or using the server as a gateway for scanning. Specifically, by manipulating the 'Connect to' field on the login panel, an attacker can send requests to arbitrary internal hosts and ports and determine if ports are open or closed based on the server's response.",
    "Root cause": "The Cockpit login page allows specifying a target host and port for SSH connections. This functionality can be abused by an unauthenticated user by sending crafted requests to internal hosts and ports, using Cockpit as a proxy to probe those internal resources.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can probe internal networks, bypassing firewall rules and gaining visibility of internal services and open ports.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed through HTTP requests to the Cockpit login page. An attacker manipulates the 'Connect to' field to inject a target internal host and port into the URL.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the Cockpit server's web interface, without the need for prior authentication."
