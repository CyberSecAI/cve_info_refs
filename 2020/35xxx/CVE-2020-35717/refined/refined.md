Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35717:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-provided input, specifically HTML content, within the `zonote` application. This allows for the injection of malicious code through crafted notes. The application processes and renders HTML without proper escaping, which leads to the execution of arbitrary scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS because it renders unsanitized HTML.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE):  Because Node.js integration is enabled in the Electron app, the injected JavaScript can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine by using Node.js APIs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine.
- An attacker could potentially take full control of the user's system.
- The attacker can modify or steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted note file (`.znt`) containing malicious HTML/JavaScript.
- An attacker can distribute a specially crafted `.znt` file (or through a method of delivering content to the application, such as a web page or other applications), which when opened with `zonote`, triggers the XSS and subsequent RCE.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious `.znt` file that contains the exploit code
- The attacker needs to trick the user to open the crafted `.znt` file with the vulnerable `zonote` application.
- No special privileges are required as the application runs within the user's context.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists because of the application's reliance on `webview` element which renders unsanitized HTML in the context where Node.js is integrated allowing for a more potent attack than simple XSS.
- The vulnerability was disclosed publicly after the owner of the `zonote` project stated they would not maintain the project nor fix the vulnerability.
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit and details about how to reproduce it.

This analysis provides more details than the generic CVE description which simply mentions an unspecified vulnerability.
