The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35814.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the web interface of several NETGEAR router and WiFi system models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected devices, which are then stored and executed when other users access the same pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is high in terms of Confidentiality and Integrity, but the availability of the service is not affected. Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to perform malicious actions on the user's behalf within the router's web interface, including changing device configurations, stealing cookies or session tokens, and potentially taking full control of the device.
- Since the vulnerability is stored XSS, the attacker only needs to inject the script once and it would execute whenever a user visits a vulnerable page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the device to inject the malicious script.
- The attack vector is the web interface of the affected NETGEAR devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have authenticated access to the administrative interface of the NETGEAR device. This means they would need valid credentials to log into the router's management interface.
- User interaction is not directly required to trigger the exploit but the injected malicious script is triggered when a legitimate user accesses the vulnerable page.
