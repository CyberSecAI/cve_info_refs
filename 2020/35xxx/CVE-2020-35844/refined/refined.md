Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35844:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read due to an invalid memory access. The code attempts to read a byte from memory at the address `ecx + eax`, where the calculated address falls outside of the valid memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to the invalid memory access, leading to a denial of service. It is possible that an attacker could leverage this for arbitrary code execution, but that is not explicitly described in this content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted image file. This implies that by providing a malicious image file, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read during the parsing or processing of the file by FastStone Image Viewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted image file to the vulnerable software, most likely through file loading mechanisms of FastStone Image Viewer 7.5

**Technical Details:**
- The instruction `mov al,byte ptr [ecx+eax]` at address `004be9c4` within `FSViewer.exe` is where the out-of-bounds read occurs.
- The values of registers at the time of the crash are given as: `eax=003f15e0 ebx=000002b4 ecx=0278ba20`.
- Attempted read address `ecx + eax = 0278ba20 + 003f15e0 = 02b7d000`. The read from `ds:002b:02b7d000` results in an access violation due to the `??` value.
- The module load for `image00400000` did not load symbols, making precise analysis more difficult.

The provided content does give specific details about the crash at the instruction level.
