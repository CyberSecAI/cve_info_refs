Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35576:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the TP-Link TL-WR841N router's firmware. Specifically, the `host` parameter within the Traceroute diagnostic feature is vulnerable to OS command injection. The router's backend processes user-supplied input from the `host` field, likely via a `system()` call, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `host` parameter used in the Traceroute functionality. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. This can lead to:
    *   **Full System Compromise:**  An attacker can gain complete control over the device.
    *   **Malware Installation:**  Malware can be installed on the router.
    *   **Data Theft:**  Sensitive information stored on the router could be accessed.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The router's functionality can be disrupted, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Router Bricking:** It is possible to permanently damage the device via commands, requiring a replacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is accessible through the router's web interface, making it remotely exploitable within the local network (and potentially through port forwarding from the internet if the web interface is exposed).
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can craft malicious HTTP POST requests to the router containing the injected commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be able to authenticate to the web interface using valid credentials (default admin:admin, or other user provided credentials).
*   **HTTP Communication:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface.

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerable parameter is the `host` field sent to the router within the `[TRACEROUTE_DIAG#...]` message during the initial traceroute request.
* The exploit leverages double quotes and backticks (`"`payload`) to escape the context of the `system()` call and inject commands.
* The exploit script provided demonstrates how to send the required requests with a user provided command injected in the host field.
* The vulnerability was present in firmware versions prior to `201216` for the TL-WR841N V13 (JP).

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3:** 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **CVSS v2:** 8.5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

The CVSS v3 score indicates a high severity vulnerability due to its network-based attack vector, low attack complexity, high privilege requirements, no user interaction requirement, and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The CVSS v2 score also reflects a high severity rating with similar impact, but with medium attack complexity and a single authentication requirement.

**Mitigation:**

The vendor released a firmware update (version `201216`) that addresses the vulnerability by sanitizing the input and preventing command injection. Users of the affected device are advised to update the firmware immediately to mitigate this security risk.
