# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

When a Multihash is created, we make sure that the supplied code is supported,

hence part of the code table. Throw an error if a passed in multihash contains

an unsupported code.

Fixes [#70](https://github.com/multiformats/rust-multihash/issues/70).

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Description

In versions prior 0.11.3 it's possible to make `from_slice` panic by feeding it certain malformed input.
It's never documented that `from_slice` (and `from_bytes` which wraps it) can panic, and its' return type (`Result<Self, DecodeError>`) suggests otherwise.

In practice, `from_slice`/`from_bytes` is frequently used in networking code (for example [in rust-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/7b415d5e7040e45c541f76f2c409e63d4d3249c6/core/src/peer_id.rs#L89)) and is being called with unsanitized data from untrusted sources.
This can allow attackers to cause DoS by causing an unexpected `panic` in the network client's code.
