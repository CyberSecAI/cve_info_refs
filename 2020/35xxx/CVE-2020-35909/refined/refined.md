Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35909

**Root Cause:** The `from_slice` function in the `multihash` crate could panic when provided with certain malformed inputs. This behavior was not documented, and the function's return type (`Result<Self, DecodeError>`) suggested it wouldn't panic, leading to assumptions about its usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncaught Panic:** The primary vulnerability is that `from_slice` (and `from_bytes` which wraps it) can unexpectedly panic when parsing malformed input.
- **Incorrect Error Handling:** The function's return type (`Result`) implied that errors would be returned, not lead to a panic.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The function did not have sufficient input validation to prevent panics when receiving unexpected input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing malformed input to the `from_slice` or `from_bytes` functions, an attacker could cause a panic in the application. Since these functions are used in networking code, this could lead to a denial of service for network clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network connections since these functions process data from network sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malformed input that will be processed by the vulnerable `from_slice` or `from_bytes` function. This usually implies the attacker has some degree of control over network communication with the vulnerable system.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed in version 0.11.3 of the `multihash` crate.
- The vulnerability is present in the `multihash::digests::MultihashGeneric::from_bytes` and `multihash::digests::MultihashRefGeneric::from_slice` functions for versions `< 0.11.3`.
- The `from_slice`/`from_bytes` functions are often used in networking code, particularly when dealing with data from untrusted sources, increasing the risk of exploitation.
- The fix was implemented by ensuring the supplied code is supported and throwing an error if a passed-in multihash contains an unsupported code.
- The CVSS score is 7.5 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
