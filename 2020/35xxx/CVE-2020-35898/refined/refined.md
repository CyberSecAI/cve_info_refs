Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35898:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a custom implementation of a `Cell` primitive in the `actix-utils` crate. This custom `Cell` did not properly track mutable references to the data it held.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The primary weakness is the ability to obtain multiple mutable references to the same memory location. In Rust, this violates memory safety rules. The `Cell::get_mut()` method could be called repeatedly, allowing for multiple mutable references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The most likely impact is arbitrary memory corruption, potentially leading to use-after-free conditions. This could cause a program crash or, in some cases, allow for more severe security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploitable through the public API of the affected crate. Repeated calls to `Cell::get_mut()` could be performed via normal program execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- No specific attacker capabilities or privileges are required. An attacker merely needs to be able to use the affected crate in a Rust program to trigger the vulnerability by calling the `get_mut()` method.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved replacing the custom `Cell<T>` implementation with `Rc<RefCell<T>>`, which correctly handles mutable references in a safe manner.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 9.1 (Critical), indicating a high potential for exploitation and damage.
- The vulnerability is in the `actix-utils` crate, specifically in versions prior to 2.0.0.
- There is a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploit.
