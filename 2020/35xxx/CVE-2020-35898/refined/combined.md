## Description

![@Shnatsel](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291257?u=6d52ad6b671a922da249dd410c15ba2634eee3a4&v=4&size=48)[Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel)opened [on Jul 19, 2020](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/issues/160#issue-661164382)

Right now there is no mechanism in `Cell` to track whether a mutable reference to the data is already acquired. Thus it is possible to obtain several mutable references to the same memory location by calling `Cell::get_mut()` repeatedly:

```
let mycell = Cell::new(vec![1,2,3]);
let ref1 = mysell.get_mut();
let ref2 = mysell.get_mut(); // obtained a second mutable reference; UB starts here
```

This may result in pretty much arbitrary memory corruption, most likely a use-after-free. Even though no code internal to Actix makes two obvious calls to `get_mut()` in a row, this behavior has been shown to be exploitable from the public API (see [PoC that fails MIRI](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=3b2cabc2ba83096418d55ecee5c71809)).

PR [#158](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/158) has removed one instance of this Cell and all uses of it. However, there is [another copy of it](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/blob/master/actix-utils/src/cell.rs) in the repository in `actix-utils` crate, and there are 23 calls to `.get_mut()`.

The obvious fix is to replace all uses of custom `Cell<T>` with `Rc<RefCell<T>>` (the way it was before the introduction of a custom cell in [20b03a4](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/commit/20b03a478063d6bb293a6636632f976113812e13)), like it was done in [#158](https://github.com/actix/actix-net/pull/158).

### Description

The custom implementation of a Cell primitive in the affected versions of this crate
does not keep track of mutable references to the underlying data.

This allows obtaining several mutable references to the same object
which may result in arbitrary memory corruption, most likely use-after-free.

The flaw was corrected by switching from a bespoke `Cell<T>` implementation to `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.

If you make a Result<Server, \_>, you can't call unwrap\_err() on the Result because Server doesn't derive Debug.

This PR derives Debug for Server and ServerCommand.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
