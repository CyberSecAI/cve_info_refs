The provided content is related to a security advisory for a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is not CVE-2020-35817. It does, however, provide details about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to malicious sites. The advisory indicates a high impact for confidentiality and integrity but no impact on availability.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious script through a vulnerable input on the affected NETGEAR routers and wifi systems. The injected script is stored on the device and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The advisory indicates an adjacent network attack vector and high privileges are required. This suggests that the attacker needs to be on the same network as the device and have administrator-level access to inject the malicious script. User interaction is not required.
