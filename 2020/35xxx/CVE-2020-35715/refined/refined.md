Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-35715:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the `upload_settings.cgi` script of the Linksys RE6500 firmware. Specifically, the filename provided during the configuration file upload process is not properly validated before being used in a system call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary code by crafting a malicious filename that includes shell commands.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `upload_settings.cgi` script directly uses the provided filename in a `touch` command without any sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the device's operating system by injecting them into the filename during the config file upload. This allows for complete control of the device, including the ability to modify system configurations, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the configuration file upload functionality, specifically the vulnerable `upload_settings.cgi` script.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the device's web interface with a crafted filename during the configuration upload process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Linksys RE6500 device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker can directly send a malicious request without logging into the device's web interface.

**Additional Details:**

The blog post provides greater detail than the official CVE description:
- The blog post details the exact location of the vulnerability within the firmware.
- The blog post also contains a proof-of-concept example of how the code injection can be performed using a crafted filename.
- The blog post clarifies that the configuration file is not encrypted, but rather compressed using BZ2.
- The blog post also mentions that by combining multiple vulnerabilities, it is possible to achieve a full Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution.

The vulnerability is present in firmware versions prior to 1.0.11.001.
