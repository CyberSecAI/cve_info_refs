Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35964:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
The provided content from Gentoo explicitly mentions CVE-2020-35964 and states it is a vulnerability present in FFmpeg. The commit message on github confirms that the code fixes an out-of-array access. Thus, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `track_header()` function within the `libavformat/vividas.c` file in FFmpeg. Specifically, it stems from improper handling of extradata packing checks, leading to potential out-of-array access.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The code did not correctly validate the size of the extradata, allowing an attacker to craft a VIVIDAS file where the calculation of `xd_size` is incorrect, leading to out-of-array accesses when reading the data into `data_len`.
- **Integer Overflow:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the fix suggests an integer overflow was possible, causing the xd_size to be smaller than expected and triggering an out-of-bounds write.
- **Incorrect calculation of buffer size:** There was an incorrect calculation of the required buffer size for the extradata.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious media file that exploits the out-of-bounds access.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability could also lead to a denial of service due to the crash caused by the out-of-bounds access.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious media file:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted VIVIDAS media file. This file, when processed by a vulnerable version of FFmpeg, triggers the flawed extradata handling, leading to exploitation.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to open the malicious media file.
- **Ability to Craft Media Files:** Attackers need to craft a VIVIDAS file specifically to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message provides a link to the fuzzing process that found this vulnerability: `<https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/ffmpeg>`.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202105-24) confirms the vulnerability, its impact, and the resolution (upgrade to FFmpeg 4.4 or later).

In summary, CVE-2020-35964 is a critical vulnerability in FFmpeg related to incorrect extradata handling in the VIVIDAS demuxer, potentially leading to code execution or a denial of service when processing maliciously crafted media files.
