The provided content relates to CVE-2020-35489.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames during file uploads within the Contact Form 7 plugin. This allows attackers to bypass filename restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload
- Improper filename sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can upload arbitrary files, including executable scripts, which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
- Attackers could potentially take complete control of the compromised website.

**Attack vectors:**
- A form submitter (attacker) uploads a file through a contact form using the vulnerable Contact Form 7 plugin.
- The attacker bypasses filename sanitization to upload malicious files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit forms on a website using the vulnerable version of Contact Form 7 (5.3.1 or older).
- No authentication is required to submit the form.
