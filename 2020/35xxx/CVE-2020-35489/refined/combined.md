## [Contact Form 7 5.3.2](https://contactform7.com/2020/12/17/contact-form-7-532/)

[December 17, 2020](https://contactform7.com/2020/12/17/contact-form-7-532/) [Takayuki Miyoshi](https://contactform7.com/author/miyoshi/)

Contact Form 7 5.3.2 has been released. This is an urgent security and maintenance release. We strongly encourage you to update to it immediately.

An unrestricted file upload vulnerability has been found in Contact Form 7 5.3.1 and older versions. Utilizing this vulnerability, a form submitter can bypass Contact Form 7’s filename sanitization, and upload a file which can be executed as a script file on the host server. This issue has been reported by [Jinson Varghese Behanan](https://www.jinsonvarghese.com/) from [Astra Security](https://www.getastra.com/).

**Requires:** WordPress 5.4 or higher

**Tested up to:** WordPress 5.6

**[» Download Contact Form 7 plugin from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)**

#### Major changes

* Removes control, separator, and other types of special characters from filename to fix the unrestricted file upload vulnerability issue.
* Akismet: Sets ISO 8601 date/time format for the `comment_date_gmt` parameter.

You can browse the full list of changes on [GitHub](https://github.com/takayukister/contact-form-7/compare/v5.3.1...v5.3.2).

Why it’s unusable? This plugin was working so fine. Customize it it’s a nightmare!

Overhyped plugin simply because it is free. It is the ultimate barebones of a plugin that people find necessary. There are no features, customizing anything means you are either a) a programmer or b) have to email support (in which case good luck getting help, egos too big). Gets no updates, no features, no accessibility or UX improvements. You’re better off paying for a plugin than pulling your hair out to get it working as needed.

The team is highly responsive and helpful. They arranged a Google Meet session to assist me with an API and JSON data format issue, thoroughly resolving the problem on my end.

### [Translation issue and nightmare support.](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/translation-issue-and-nightmare-support/)

This free plugin is very useful and has done what it was supposed to do for many years. However, there are a few issues that are very annoying and a total deal breaker, if not a show stopper:
Plugin creator did not comply with WordPress Codex regarding how translations are handled. Thus this plugin will eventually cause problems in a multilingual site.
Forum support by plugin creator is very poor. He replies, yes, but his replies are a joke. He simply doesn’t care. He doesn’t read properly nor does he do any testing, even after providing everything he asked for. He is a time stealer.
My personal resume: I will switch contact forms on all of my clients’ sites. There are better alternatives out there. I am of course willing to pay for support. And this is my suggestion for @takayukister : provide paid support, if you think your time is too valuable, to give a useful reply or provide assistance with your free plugin. Or take that plugin offline or officially state that you won’t provide support at all and refrain from stealing people’s time by requesting non sense things and then ignoring them in return.

# Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability found in Contact Form 7 Plugin

December 17, 20202 min read

Contact Form 7 version 5.3.1 and below were found to be vulnerable to unrestricted file upload vulnerability while testing a customer’s website. Contact Form 7 version 5.3.2 with a fix was released on December 17, 2020.

**[CVE-2020-35489](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35489)**

## **Summary**

Contact Form 7 is a popular WordPress plugin with over 5 million active installations. It was found to be vulnerable to unrestricted file upload, which is a type of vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to upload files of any type, bypassing all restrictions placed regarding the allowed upload-able file types.

On a website that uses the vulnerable version of Contact Form 7 and stores the files on the server itself, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload malicious content such as web shells.

## Vulnerability

Checking the statistics of the plugin, it can be seen that a large number of WordPress websites are still using older versions. We’ve also been getting multiple requests asking for an exploit which has been worrisome. Hence, taking into consideration the millions of websites on older versions and the interest of black hat community, we won’t be releasing a PoC.

Further, we can confirm that WordPress websites not using the upload functionality in Contact Form 7, running the latest version, or using any good security tool are protected from this. We haven’t tracked any active exploitation in the wild until now.

## **Timeline**

* Vulnerability reported to the Contact Form 7 plugin developer – December 16, 2020.
* Contact Form 7 update containing the fix to the vulnerability released – December 17, 2020.

Special mention to the Contact Form 7 plugin developer, [Takayuki Miyoshi](https://contactform7.com/), who was quick to respond and address the issue keeping in mind the security of the plugin users. Highly appreciate such responsible developers. 🙂

## Recommendation

* Update to the latest version immediately.
* If you are using a web application firewall like [Astra](https://www.getastra.com/), you are already protected.
