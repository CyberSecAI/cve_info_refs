The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35811.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the web interface of several Netgear router models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The web interface allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored by the router and executed when other users access the affected pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the router's web interface, which could be executed when an administrator accesses the interface. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the web interface.
    - Potentially gain control of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected routers. An attacker would need to inject a malicious script into a vulnerable field or parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access the router's web management interface and inject the malicious code. This could be achieved via several means such as:
    -  Being on the same network
    -  Exploiting an existing vulnerability to gain access to the management interface.
    - Social engineering to convince someone with access to the web interface to perform an action.
