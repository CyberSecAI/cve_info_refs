Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises when the MediaWiki configuration sets `MediaWiki:Mainpage` to `Special:MyLanguage/Main Page`. This configuration interferes with the revision deletion process for log entries. When a user attempts to change the visibility of a log entry, the system fails to properly process the request because it tries to interpret `Special:MyLanguage/Main Page` as a valid title, which it is not in the context of revision deletion, leading to a redirect to the main page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of `Special:MyLanguage/Main Page` in the context of revision deletion.
- Failure to properly identify and process the intended action (revision deletion) when the main page is a special page.
- Improper redirect when trying to access a revision deletion form via `action=historysubmit`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service/Functionality:** Legitimate users, including administrators and oversighters, are unable to hide log entries. This disrupts the ability to properly moderate content and remove sensitive information from the public view, effectively blocking certain administrative actions.
- **Information Exposure:** Inability to hide log entries can result in unnecessary information exposure

**Attack vectors:**
- A user attempts to change the visibility of log entries through the standard MediaWiki interface (Special:Log).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be logged in to observe the redirect.
- The attacker must be on a MediaWiki instance that has set `MediaWiki:Mainpage` to `Special:MyLanguage/Main Page`
- The attacker must have appropriate permissions to change the visibility of log entries.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific configuration setting rather than a flaw in the core code itself.
- A patch was created to fix this. The patch sets a dummy title for action buttons on `Special:Log` so that action buttons do not try to redirect to a special page.
- The issue was initially observed on Meta-Wiki, outreachwiki, and wikimania2018wiki, but it is likely present on other wikis with the problematic configuration setting.
- The fix was deployed to production and is also included in MediaWiki 1.31.11 and 1.35.1.
- This issue has been assigned CVE-2020-35477 for tracking purposes.
