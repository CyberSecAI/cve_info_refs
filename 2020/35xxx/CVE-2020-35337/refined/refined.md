Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is a bypass of CVE-2020-35337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of:

1.  **Improper Filtering Logic in `tsFilter` Function:** The `tsFilter` function, intended to sanitize input, replaces dangerous keywords with null, but only performs the replacement once. This allows attackers to use a double-write technique (e.g., `SELselect ECT`) to bypass the filter and inject malicious SQL keywords (e.g., `SELECT`).
2.  **Improper Filtering Order**: The application filters the user-supplied parameter `kw` using the `tsFilter` function and then decodes it using `urldecode()`. The `tsgpc()` function does perform `addslashes()` to escape characters but since the parameter doesn't contain any single or double quotes, `addslashes()` doesn't do anything. This order of operations allows an attacker to bypass the intended sanitization by providing a double URL-encoded payload. The server first auto-URLdecodes the input, and then after filtering (which does not modify the URL-encoded payload), performs another URL decoding which results in the malicious payload being introduced to the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into an SQL query.
*   **Blacklist Filter:** The `tsFilter` function uses a blacklist approach, which is inherently flawed as it can be bypassed with techniques like double-writing and other variations of malicious keywords.
*   **Incorrect Filtering Order**: The filtering order allows attackers to bypass the global `tsgpc()` filter by providing a double URL-encoded payload, thus bypassing the addslashes function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
*   **Data Access and Modification:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information, modify existing data, or insert malicious content into the database.
*   **Complete Database Control**: Through SQL injection, an attacker could gain complete control over the database server and perform destructive operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `kw` parameter in an HTTP GET request to the `/index.php` endpoint with specific application parameters (`app=topic&ac=admin&mg=topic&ts=list`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs administrative access to the ThinkSAAS application. This is a post-authentication vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ThinkSAAS application server.
*   **Understanding of URL Encoding:** The attacker needs to understand how URL encoding works to create a suitable double URL encoded payload to bypass filtering.
*   **Understanding of SQL syntax:** The attacker needs to know how to construct SQL injection payloads to interact with the database.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `app/topic/action/admin/topic.php`.
*   The `tsFilter` function is located in `thinksaas/tsFunction.php`.
*   The `tsgpc()` function is in `thinksaas/thinksaas.php`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `kw` parameter is used in a SQL query after filtering and URL decoding.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed and fixed in ThinkSAAS version 3.53.

**Vulnerability Remediation:**

*   The blog recommends modifying the `tsFilter` function to use a while loop instead of an if statement to ensure all instances of blacklisted words are removed.
*   The blog recommends removing the `urldecode` function call after filtering, so filtering is done on decoded parameters.
*   The blog suggests escaping values before constructing a query using `escape()`.
