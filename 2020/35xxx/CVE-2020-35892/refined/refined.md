Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-35892:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `index()` function within the `simple-slab` crate does not perform proper bounds checking, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Additionally, the `remove()` function contains an off-by-one error when copying an element, resulting in memory leakage and an uninitialized memory drop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: Accessing memory outside the allocated buffer due to lack of boundary checks in `index()`.
- Off-by-one error: Incorrect memory address calculation in `remove()`, leading to reading from an invalid address.
- Memory leakage and uninitialized memory drop:  Consequence of the off-by-one error in the `remove()` function which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure, potentially leaking sensitive data stored in adjacent memory locations.
- Memory corruption and unpredictable behavior, denial of service.
- Potential crashes or unexpected behavior in the application utilizing the vulnerable library.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: According to the CVSS vector, the attack can be carried out remotely. The attacker would need a way to influence the index used in the `Slab::index()` to trigger an out-of-bounds read. 
- Through calling the `remove()` method on the vulnerable `simple-slab` structure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges and doesn't require user interaction to trigger this vulnerability.
- The attacker would need the ability to control or manipulate the index used in `Slab::index()` method.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `simple-slab` versions prior to 0.3.3.
- The fix was introduced in version 0.3.3.
- The vulnerability is present in the Rust ecosystem.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1, with a severity rating of Critical.
- The EPSS score is 0.214% (59th percentile), which is a measure of the likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild.

This information provides a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability beyond the basic description provided in the CVE, specifically including the off-by-one error in the `remove` function, and impact on memory safety.
