Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when parsing Nef polygon data files. Specifically, when reading the sface data, the `SD.link_as_face_cycle()` function uses an index from the input file to access the `SEdge_of` vector without verifying if the index is within the valid range.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the unchecked index when accessing the `SEdge_of` vector.
*   **Type confusion:** The out-of-bounds read leads to type confusion when arbitrary memory locations are accessed and interpreted as different data structures.
*   **Improper validation of array index:** The code does not validate if the provided index is within the allocated bounds of the vectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code execution:** The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious input file, an attacker can cause the program to read from and potentially overwrite arbitrary memory locations, leading to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious input file:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted Nef polygon data file. The attacker provides a file with an invalid index for the `SEdge_of` vector when parsing sface data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed Nef polygon data file to the vulnerable application (CGAL library). This could involve convincing a user to open a malicious file or by supplying the malicious file through another vulnerable service.

**Technical Details:**

The specific vulnerable code is located in:
`Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_sface()`:
```c++
template <typename EW>
bool SNC_io_parser<EW>::
read_sface(SFace_handle sfh) {

  bool OK = true;
  int index;
  char cc;

  in >> index;
  OK = OK && test_string("{");

  in >> index;
  sfh->center_vertex() = Vertex_of[index];
  OK = OK && test_string(",");

  in >> cc;
  while(isdigit(cc)) {
    in.putback(cc);
    in >> index;
    //    sfh->boundary_entry_objects().push_back(SEdge_of[index]);
    SM_decorator SD(&*sfh->center_vertex());
    SD.link_as_face_cycle(SEdge_of[index],sfh); // <- oob read here
    in >> cc;
  }
```
The code reads an index from the input, and then uses this index to access the `SEdge_of` vector, without any prior validation of the index. This results in an out-of-bounds read which can be further leveraged to achieve code execution.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided reports indicate that multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Nef polygon parsing functionality of CGAL. CVE-2020-35631 is one of them, all of which have the same underlying cause: the lack of index validation while parsing the input.
*   The Talos report provides detailed code snippets and crash information for many of the related CVEs, showing how the out-of-bounds reads occur in various parts of the parsing process.

The content from debian and gentoo also confirm the vulnerability and the need for a patch.
