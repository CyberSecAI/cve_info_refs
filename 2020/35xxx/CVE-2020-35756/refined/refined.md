The provided content is related to CVE-2020-35756.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `luci_service` daemon running on TCP port 7777 lacks authentication for the `GETPASS` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `luci_service` daemon exposes a custom binary protocol on port 7777, used for device setup.
- There is no authentication required to execute the `GETPASS` command.
- The `GETPASS` command returns the device configuration password in cleartext.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker with network access to port 7777 can leak the user's device configuration password in cleartext.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to TCP port 7777 is required.
- The attacker sends a crafted `GETPASS` command using the custom binary protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have network access to the device.
- No authentication is required.
