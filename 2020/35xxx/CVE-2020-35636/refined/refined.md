Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-35636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking within the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of the CGAL library, specifically when handling input files. The `SNC_io_parser::read_sface()` function reads an index from the input file and uses it to access the `Volume_of` vector. There is no check to ensure the index is within the bounds of `Volume_of` before accessing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability within the `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h` file in the `SNC_io_parser::read_sface()` function, where `sfh->volume()` is assigned a value from the `Volume_of` vector based on a user controlled index without proper bounds check, potentially accessing memory outside of allocated buffer for the vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:**  The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By providing a specially crafted input file with an out-of-bounds index, an attacker can cause a read from an arbitrary memory address. This out-of-bounds read leads to type confusion when the memory is used by the application, which allows for the possibility of code execution.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds read can also lead to memory corruption by accessing memory which does not belong to the application, which leads to crashes and unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted malformed input file to CGAL's Nef polygon parsing functionality. This file is designed to contain index values that, when read and used, will cause out-of-bounds reads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted `.nef` or `.nef3` file as input to an application or service using the vulnerable CGAL library. This could be achieved through file uploads, network requests, or any other method where user-provided input is parsed by the affected CGAL code.

**Additional Notes**

*   **Multiple Vulnerabilities:** This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-28601 to CVE-2020-28636, and CVE-2020-35628 to CVE-2020-35636) discovered in the same CGAL library related to similar parsing issues, indicating a systemic problem in the way input files were handled.
*   **Specific File Format**: The vulnerability exists in the code that parses .nef files.
*   **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability is not just a simple out-of-bounds read; it leads to type confusion due to the way that the read memory is used in the application, resulting in the possibility of code execution.
*   **Affected Versions:** The reports identify CGAL-5.1.1 as the specific vulnerable version, and note that versions prior to 5.4.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is addressed in CGAL version 5.4.1 or later.
