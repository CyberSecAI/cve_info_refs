Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `DCTStream::getChars` function within the Poppler library. Specifically, when processing a PDF, the function attempts to copy a block of data using `memcpy`, and the size of the data exceeds the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Heap-Buffer-Overflow:**  The core vulnerability is a classic heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs when data is written beyond the allocated boundary of a heap buffer.
- **Insufficient Size Check:** The code doesn't properly validate or calculate the necessary buffer size before performing the `memcpy` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash/Denial of Service:** The provided ASAN log shows that the overflow leads to a program crash, which can result in a denial of service.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in this report, heap-buffer-overflows can be exploited to overwrite critical data structures or function pointers. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PDF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specifically crafted PDF file. By embedding a specially encoded stream inside the PDF, the attacker can cause the `DCTStream::getChars` function to overflow the buffer.
- **`pdftops` Utility:** The provided "How to reproduce" command indicates that the vulnerability is triggered when the `pdftops` utility processes the malicious PDF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Supply Malicious PDF:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the target system or user with a malicious PDF file. This could occur through email attachments, downloads, websites or other channels.
- **Use of Vulnerable Version of Poppler:**  The target must be using a vulnerable version of the Poppler library (specifically, version 20.12.1).

**Technical Details:**

- The crash occurs inside `__asan_memcpy` at address `0x4def3b`.
- The `DCTStream::getChars` function at `DCTStream.cc:223` is the origin of the overflow.
- The overflow writes 219 bytes beyond the allocated buffer at address `0x633000019830`
- The buffer at `0x633000000800` is 102448 bytes.
- The ASAN log provides a full call stack showing how execution gets to the vulnerable code, starting with `main` in `pdftops.cc` and going through various functions related to PDF parsing and image rendering.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing the exact code location, a crash log, and the method for reproduction.
- The ASAN output is very helpful in understanding the root cause and identifying the exact location of the bug.
