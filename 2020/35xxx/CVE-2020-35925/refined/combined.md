## Package

cargo

magnetic
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 2.0.1

## Patched versions

2.0.1

## Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync and Send traits for MPMCConsumer and MPMCProducer types. This allows users to send types that do not implement Send trait across thread boundaries, which can cause a data race. The flaw was corrected in the 2.0.1 release by adding T: Send bound to affected Sync/Send trait implementations.

# Send bound needed on T (for Send/Sync impl of Producer/Consumer types) #9

Hello 🦀 ,

while scanning crates.io, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) have noticed a soundness/memory safety issue in this crate which allows safe Rust code to trigger undefined behavior.

All queue types (spsc, spmc, mpsc, mpmc) are used to send an object from one thread to another.

Currently, `Send/Sync` is implemented for producer/consumer types of all queues without a `Send` bound on `T` (as below).

```
unsafe impl<T, B: Buffer<T>> Send for MPMCConsumer<T, B> {}
unsafe impl<T, B: Buffer<T>> Send for MPMCProducer<T, B> {}
unsafe impl<T, B: Buffer<T>> Sync for MPMCConsumer<T, B> {}
unsafe impl<T, B: Buffer<T>> Sync for MPMCProducer<T, B> {}
```

This allows users to send non-`Send` objects to other threads, and can potentially let users write safe Rust code that trigger undefined behavior.

Here is a proof of concept that invokes undefined behavior using this crate.

Due to the data race on the internal reference count of `Rc`, the program below either crashes at runtime

(On Ubuntu, `Illegal Instruction (core dumped)`) or panics at the end of the program (indicating a memory leak).

```
use magnetic::buffer::dynamic::DynamicBuffer;
use magnetic::{Producer, Consumer};
use magnetic::mpmc::mpmc_queue;

use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let (p, c) = mpmc_queue(DynamicBuffer::new(32).unwrap());
    const N_ITER: usize = 2_000_000;

    // Send `Consumer` to child thread.
    let t1 = std::thread::spawn(move || {
        for _ in 0..N_ITER {
            // Decrements refcount of `Rc` w/o synchronization
            c.pop().unwrap();
        }
    });

    let original_rc = Rc::new(0_i32);
    for _ in 0..N_ITER {
        // Increments refcount of `Rc` w/o synchronization
        p.push(Rc::clone(&original_rc)).unwrap();
    }
    t1.join().unwrap();

    assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&original_rc), 1);
}
```

In order to prevent this undefined behavior, we need a `Send` bound on `T` for both `Send/Sync` impls of producer/consumer types.

`Send` bound is needed for `impl Sync`, due to the fact that it is possible to send objects to other threads by holding a reference to Producer/Consumer types.

I made a fix that lets the compiler revoke programs like the above, and I'll submit a PR right away.

Please let us know what you think about the issue or the fix.

Thank you for checking out this issue 🦀
