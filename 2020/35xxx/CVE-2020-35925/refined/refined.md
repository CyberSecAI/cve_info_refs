```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `Sync` and `Send` traits were unconditionally implemented for `MPMCConsumer` and `MPMCProducer` types without a `Send` bound on the generic type `T`. This allowed users to send non-`Send` objects across thread boundaries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data race due to lack of synchronization when sending non-`Send` types across threads."
    ],
    "impact": "Data races leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or memory leaks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending objects that do not implement the `Send` trait across thread boundaries using `MPMCConsumer` or `MPMCProducer`.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to use the `magnetic` crate and spawn threads. No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability once the program is running."
