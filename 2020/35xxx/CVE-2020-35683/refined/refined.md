Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the NicheStack TCP/IP stack processes ICMP packets. Specifically, the code uses an unchecked value of the IP payload size (taken from the IP header) to calculate the ICMP checksum.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** If the IP payload size is set to a value smaller than the actual size of the IP header, the ICMP checksum calculation function will read memory out of bounds.
*   **Improper input validation:** The code does not validate the IP payload size against the IP header's actual length before performing calculations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition due to the out-of-bounds read. The specific type of DoS (e.g., crashing, hanging) would depend on how the device handles the memory access violation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed ICMP packet sent over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
*   **Packet crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malformed ICMP packets with an IP payload size smaller than the IP header size.

**Additional Details:**
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of 14 vulnerabilities collectively called "INFRA:HALT" found in the NicheStack TCP/IP stack.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of NicheStack before version 4.3.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `in_ipv4` module version 1.5 of the NicheStack
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Forescout Research Labs and JFrog Security Research.

This CVE is related to memory corruption issues similar to those seen in AMNESIA:33 which also affected ICMPv4 and TCPv4.
