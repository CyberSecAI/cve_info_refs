```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'users_alerts' feature, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects the malicious script into the 'users_alerts' field when adding a new alert. The payload is then stored in the system and executed when the page is viewed by other users.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add or modify 'users_alerts'."
