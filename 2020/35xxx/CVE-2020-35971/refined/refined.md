The provided content relates to CVE-2020-35971.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization of the `searinfo` parameter in the `content.class.php` file, specifically on row 42. Additionally, an XSS vulnerability is present in the `/admin/system_manage/user_config_edit.html` value parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in two different locations:
   - Unfiltered `searinfo` parameter in `content.class.php`
   - Unsanitized `value` parameter in `/admin/system_manage/user_config_edit.html`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, leading to:
   - Account hijacking through cookie theft.
   - Defacement of the website
   - Redirection to malicious sites
   - Potential data theft
   - Other malicious actions on the victim's browser

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted requests that include malicious scripts in the vulnerable parameters.
- In the case of `/admin/system_manage/user_config_edit.html`, the vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when other users access the relevant page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable endpoints with crafted parameters.
- For the stored XSS, the attacker would need to have access to the admin panel to inject the malicious script through `user_config_edit.html`.
