Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of pinning for the buffer wrapped in `BodyStream` in the `actix-http` crate. The code was treating the buffer as if it had a fixed location in memory, which could lead to a use-after-free if the buffer's memory location was changed or deallocated prematurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. This occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security risks.
*   **Lack of Memory Pinning:** The `MessageBody` trait was not requiring the wrapped buffer to be pinned in memory. This allowed the buffer's location to change unexpectedly, leading to the use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Availability Impact:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash or unexpected termination of the application due to accessing freed memory. This is categorized as a high availability impact.
*   **No Confidentiality or Integrity Impact:** The vulnerability does not directly lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the modification of data, but primarily affects availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability through network interactions.
*   **Low Complexity:** The attack complexity is low, indicating that the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The exploitation does not require any special privileges, making it easier for an attacker to trigger.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability, increasing the risk of automated attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the application using the vulnerable `actix-http` version.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is in the `actix-http` crate, specifically in how it handles `BodyStream`.
*   The fix involved changing the `MessageBody` trait to require `Unpin` and making the `poll_next()` function accept `Pin<&mut Self>` instead of `&mut self`. This ensures that the memory for the body stream is properly pinned and not moved unexpectedly, preventing the use-after-free issue.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Versions of `actix-http` prior to `2.0.0-alpha.1` are affected.

**Patched Versions:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version `2.0.0-alpha.1` and later.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code snippet in the issue report on GitHub (`actix/actix-web#1321`) demonstrates the use-after-free condition.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as `RUSTSEC-2020-0048` in the RustSec Advisory Database and `GHSA-v3j6-xf77-8r9c` in the GitHub Advisory Database.
