## Description

![@sebzim4500](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1117028?v=4&size=48)[sebzim4500](https://github.com/sebzim4500)opened [on Jan 24, 2020](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/issues/1321#issue-554901843)
## Expected Behavior

The program below should not segfault when I only write 'safe' code.

## Current Behavior

The program below segfaults.

## Possible Solution

Change the `MessageBody` trait to take a `Pin<&mut self>` instead of a `&mut self`.

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

Run the following code in debug mode.

```
use futures::task::{noop_waker, Context};
use futures::stream::once;
use actix_http::body::{MessageBody, BodyStream};
use bytes::Bytes;

fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = futures::channel::oneshot::channel();
    let mut body_stream = Ok(BodyStream::new(once(async {
        let x = Box::new(0);
        let y = &x;
        receiver.await.unwrap();
        let z = **y;
        Ok::<_, ()>(Bytes::new())
    })));

    let waker = noop_waker();
    let mut context = Context::from_waker(&waker);

    let _ = body_stream.as_mut().unwrap().poll_next(&mut context);
    sender.send(()).unwrap();
    let _ = std::mem::replace(&mut body_stream, Err([0; 32])).unwrap().poll_next(&mut context);
}

```
## Context

I found this problem by searching for 'unsafe' in the actix-web repo.

* Rust Version (I.e, output of `rustc -V`): rustc 1.41.0-nightly
* Actix Web Version: actix-http v1.0.1

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* `>=2.0.0-alpha.1`

### Description

Affected versions of this crate did not require the buffer wrapped in `BodyStream` to be pinned,
but treated it as if it had a fixed location in memory. This may result in a use-after-free.

The flaw was corrected by making the trait `MessageBody` require `Unpin`
and making `poll_next()` function accept `Pin<&mut Self>` instead of `&mut self`.
