Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35470:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content directly references CVE-2020-35470 within a comment in the pull request discussion, confirming its relevance.
   - The description of the fix also aligns with the general description of CVE-2020-35470, which involves the proxy protocol and downstream address.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - A regression caused `downstreamRemoteAddress` on the `StreamInfo` for a connection to be set to the address of the directly connected peer instead of the address supplied by the proxy protocol filter.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Incorrectly setting of `downstreamRemoteAddress` in the `StreamInfo` when using the proxy protocol filter in a TCP proxy scenario.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - The primary impact of this vulnerability was incorrect logging of the downstream remote address. Specifically, access logs and other components relying on `StreamInfo` would record the address of the immediate peer instead of the original client address as provided in the proxy protocol header. This could potentially lead to difficulties in security analysis and debugging, as the observed IP address would not reflect the actual client source.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is not a direct exploitation but a configuration issue in conjunction with the use of the proxy protocol filter and a TCP proxy.  An attacker doesn't directly cause the issue, rather it occurs due to a regression in the code.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   -  No special attacker capabilities are required. The issue is due to misconfiguration or use of the proxy protocol in combination with tcp-proxy.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The vulnerability only affects TCP filters and does not impact HTTP filters.
   - A test was added to prevent future regressions of this issue.
   - The fix was backported to multiple Envoy release branches.
   - The vulnerability has potential security implications since it masks the real source of connection, making it harder to track potentially malicious traffic.
