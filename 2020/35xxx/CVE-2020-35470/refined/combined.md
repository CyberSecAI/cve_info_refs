Can you cut a follow up ticket about auditing this code elsewhere? It think there may be code in the HCM we don't or shouldn't need assuming stream info chaining is working correctly?

* [v1.15] http: header map security fixes for duplicate headers (#197) (#200)

Previously header matching did not match on all headers for
non-inline headers. This patch changes the default behavior to
always logically match on all headers. Multiple individual
headers will be logically concatenated with ',' similar to what
is done with inline headers. This makes the behavior effectively
consistent. This behavior can be temporary reverted by setting
the runtime value \"envoy.reloadable_features.header_match_on_all_headers\"
to \"false\".

Targeted fixes have been additionally performed on the following
extensions which make them consider all duplicate headers by default as
a comma concatenated list:
1) Any extension using CEL matching on headers.
2) The header to metadata filter.
3) The JWT filter.
4) The Lua filter.
Like primary header matching used in routing, RBAC, etc. this behavior
can be disabled by setting the runtime value
\"envoy.reloadable_features.header_match_on_all_headers\" to false.

Finally, the setCopy() header map API previously only set the first
header in the case of duplicate non-inline headers. setCopy() now
behaves similiarly to the other set*() APIs and replaces all found
headers with a single value. This may have had security implications
in the extauth filter which uses this API. This behavior can be disabled
by setting the runtime value
\"envoy.reloadable_features.http_set_copy_replace_all_headers\" to false.

is done with inline headers. This makes the behavior effectively
consistent. This behavior can be temporary reverted by setting
the runtime value "envoy.reloadable_features.header_match_on_all_headers"
to "false".

Targeted fixes have been additionally performed on the following
extensions which make them consider all duplicate headers by default as
a comma concatenated list:
1) Any extension using CEL matching on headers.
2) The header to metadata filter.
3) The JWT filter.
4) The Lua filter.
Like primary header matching used in routing, RBAC, etc. this behavior
can be disabled by setting the runtime value
"envoy.reloadable_features.header_match_on_all_headers" to false.

Finally, the setCopy() header map API previously only set the first
header in the case of duplicate non-inline headers. setCopy() now
behaves similiarly to the other set*() APIs and replaces all found
headers with a single value. This may have had security implications
in the extauth filter which uses this API. This behavior can be disabled
by setting the runtime value
"envoy.reloadable_features.http_set_copy_replace_all_headers" to false.

## Description

![@ggreenway](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8603643?u=3b41cd4fde89d76976c4ca0335f0240d17609108&v=4&size=48)[ggreenway](https://github.com/ggreenway)opened [on Nov 18, 2020](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/14087#issue-746133417)

When using proxy-protocol as a listener filter, tcp-proxy as the network filter, and access logging, the wrong downstream address is logged. The logged address should be the one from the proxy protocol header on the connection, but the direct peer address is logged instead.

   * Prevent SEGFAULT when disabling listener ([#13515](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/13515))

   This prevents the stop_listening overload action from causing
   segmentation faults that can occur if the action is enabled after the
   listener has already shut down.

   ```
   The client request stream can be deleted under the call stack of Envoy::IntegrationCodecClient::startRequest if the proxy replies quickly enough. Attempts to send an end stream on that request result in use-after-free on the client stream in cases where the client processed the full reply inside startRequest.

2. [backport to 1.16: proxy protocol: set downstreamRemoteAddress on Stre…](/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/0717f49fef0dac3818cd7cdc52bf18e0ae1f7a2c)
    …

   ```
   …amInfo ([#14132](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/14132))

   This fixes a regression which resulted in the downstreamRemoteAddress
   on the StreamInfo for a connection not having the address supplied by
   the proxy protocol filter, but instead having the address of the
   directly connected peer.

   This issue does not affect HTTP filters.
