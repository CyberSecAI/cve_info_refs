{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of Nef polygon data, specifically the lack of proper bounds checking when reading indices from the input file and using them to access vectors of objects. This allows an attacker to provide a crafted file that contains out-of-bounds indices, leading to out-of-bounds reads when these indices are used to access vector elements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Type confusion",
       "Improper Validation of Array Index"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution. Out-of-bounds reads can lead to type confusion when the data being read is used as an object. This can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted Nef polygon files"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted malformed file containing Nef polygon data. No other specific capabilities or positions are required."
  },
  "affected_component": "CGAL libcgal (specifically the Nef polygon-parsing functionality)",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-35629",
  "more_info": "The provided information includes a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the affected code snippets and the specific out-of-bounds read locations in the CGAL library. It also outlines how the parsing code reads indices from the file and uses them to access vector elements without proper bounds checking."
