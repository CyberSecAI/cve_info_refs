Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35862:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect memory management during the conversion of a `BitVec` to a `BitBox` in the `bitvec` crate. Specifically, the code was using the original base address of the allocated memory instead of the address after a potential resize operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The conversion process could lead to a use-after-free condition. This occurs when a memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
- **Double Free:**  A double-free vulnerability was also possible. This arises when the same memory location is freed multiple times, potentially leading to memory corruption and program instability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption
- Program crashes (as observed in the provided test case failure with SIGABRT)
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, though not explicitly stated in the reports

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network (as indicated by CVSS vector `AV:N`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges are required (`PR:N`)
- No user interaction is required (`UI:N`)
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely over a network.

**More Details:**
The provided information reveals more details than the CVE description alone:

- The issue was reproducible across multiple Rust versions (1.36.0 through 1.42.0) and `bitvec` versions (0.11.0 through 0.17.3).
- The bug was found during a `shrink_to_fit` operation within `alloc::raw_vec`, which was used when converting from BitVec to BitBox.
- The problem was specific to macOS and was observed with the system's `malloc` errors relating to freeing unallocated memory. It was not reproducible on Ubuntu.
- The fix involved using the memory address after resizing, which indicates the incorrect pointer calculation was the root of the vulnerability.
