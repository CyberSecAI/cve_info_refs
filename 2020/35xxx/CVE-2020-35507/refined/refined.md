Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-35507:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `bfd_pef_parse_function_stubs` function within the `bfd/pef.c` file of GNU Binutils.
- The root cause is the lack of a check for a NULL return value from `bfd_malloc()`, before the returned pointer is dereferenced by `bfd_read()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing NULL pointer check after a memory allocation, specifically in the `bfd_pef_parse_function_stubs` function.
- The `bfd_malloc()` function's potential failure to allocate memory is not handled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by triggering a NULL pointer dereference.
- This can lead to application unavailability, as the program crashes when trying to access the invalid memory location.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to provide a crafted input file to the affected tool (e.g., `objdump`).
- The crafted file must be specifically designed to cause `bfd_malloc()` to fail, thus triggering the NULL pointer dereference later when `bfd_read()` is called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted file to be processed by a vulnerable tool, such as `objdump`.
- The attacker does not necessarily need elevated privileges, as the vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the input file.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects GNU Binutils versions prior to 2.34.
- A patch was created by adding a NULL check before calling `bfd_read()`.
- The issue is also tracked upstream at <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25308>
- The upstream fix is available here: <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=7a0fb7be96e0ce79e1ae429bc1ba913e5244d537>
- NetApp products using vulnerable versions of GNU Binutils are also affected.
