Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The software (mymbCONNECT24 and mbCONNECT24) uses a shared, hardcoded database access password across different instances.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The primary weakness is the use of a single, shared password for database access in multiple deployments. This violates the principle of least privilege and secrets management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**  An attacker with access to the shared database password could potentially gain full control over the database. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of data, and denial of service.
*   **CVSS v3 Vector:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  (Local access, low complexity and privilege with no user interaction to cause high impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  An attacker needs some level of access to the system where the software is installed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low privilege:** An attacker would need to have local access with some level of privileges. 
*   **Knowledge of the hardcoded password:** The attacker would need to obtain the shared database password, which could be achieved through various means, such as reverse engineering, decompiling or internal access.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vendor acknowledges the vulnerability but states that a proper fix will come with a future architectural core-system-update, so there is currently no patch available to address the issue.
*   No way of exploitation is known at this time but it doesn't mean that it can't be exploited.
