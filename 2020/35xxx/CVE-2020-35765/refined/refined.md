**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `showresource.do` module, specifically within the `doFilter` method of the `com.adventnet.appmanager.filter.UriCollector` Java class.
- The `resourceid` parameter within a crafted HTTP request sent to `/showresource.do`, when a mobile User-Agent is used, is directly concatenated into a SQL query without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read, modify or delete data in the backend database, which may lead to unauthorized access, data corruption, or denial of service.
- The example provided shows how an attacker can change the administrator password.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker sends a malicious HTTP request to the `/showresource.do` endpoint by changing their User-Agent to simulate a mobile device.
- The `resourceid` parameter in the request is crafted with SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ManageEngine Applications Manager.
- The attacker also needs to be able to modify the User-Agent string of their browser.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in Zoho ManageEngine Applications Manager up to build 14930.
- Tenable Network Security discovered this vulnerability and reported it to ManageEngine.
- ManageEngine released a fix in version 15000 and above on January 13, 2021.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 (CRITICAL).
- The vulnerability is located in the Mobile View of the application, which is triggered by the presence of the word "mobile" in the User-Agent HTTP header
- The SQL injection occurs when the parameter "method=showResourceForResourceID" and "resourceid" is set in the request.
