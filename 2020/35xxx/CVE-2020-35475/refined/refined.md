Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `userrights-expiry-current` and `userrights-expiry-none` messages in MediaWiki not being properly escaped when displayed in the Special:UserRights page. Specifically, the code used `Message::text()` which returns raw HTML instead of escaping it. Other parts of the code in the same function correctly escaped text using Xml::element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper escaping allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript, which can be executed within the context of a user's browser.
- **Unsanitized Output:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled data (in this case, via the messages) before rendering it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript to perform actions on behalf of the victim user. This includes, but is not limited to, session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying content on the wiki.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information visible to the victim.
- **Defacement:** An attacker can modify the appearance of the page for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Special:UserRights Page:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the Special:UserRights page, especially if they lack sufficient rights to change all user rights and the left-hand table contains unchangeable groups.
- **Message Manipulation:** By manipulating the content of the `userrights-expiry-current` or `userrights-expiry-none` messages, a malicious user can inject malicious HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Rights Modification:** An attacker needs the ability to modify the content of the `userrights-expiry-current` and `userrights-expiry-none` messages (typically through editing the MediaWiki namespace) which are used on the Special:UserRights page.
- **MediaWiki Access:**  The attacker must have access to the MediaWiki instance.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix involved using `Xml::element` instead of `Message::text()` to properly escape the output.
- Patches were applied to MediaWiki versions 1.31, 1.35, and master branches.
- The vulnerability was considered low-risk and was fixed publicly with a benign commit message.
- The issue was discovered while working on another task related to double-escaping warnings.
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-35474.

In summary, CVE-2020-35475 describes an XSS vulnerability in MediaWiki stemming from unsanitized output of user-controlled messages in the Special:UserRights page. An attacker with specific permissions can exploit this to execute arbitrary code in a victim's browser.
