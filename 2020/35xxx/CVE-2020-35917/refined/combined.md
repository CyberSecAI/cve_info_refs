### @davidhewitt **[davidhewitt](/davidhewitt)** commented [Nov 28, 2020](#issue-752651342)

I have just discovered a reference counting issue in one of our `From` implementations. It leads to a reference count being decreased when it should not. Unfortunately this was an implementation introduced by me since `0.12` ü§¶

The offending line is here:

[pyo3/src/instance.rs](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/blob/32be8d9a3c463fbc3689b57680d73953355b36e0/src/instance.rs#L477)

Line 477
in
[32be8d9](/PyO3/pyo3/commit/32be8d9a3c463fbc3689b57680d73953355b36e0)

|  | let Py(ptr, \_) = other; |
| --- | --- |

I incorrectly thought the destructuring would mean that `Py::drop()` is not run for `other`. What *actually* happens is that `ptr` implements `Copy`, so it is *copied* from `other`, and then `other` is dropped.

This means `ptr` has a reference count decreased when it should not.

This PR corrects the issue and adds a test. The test fails on master.

cc [@kngwyu](https://github.com/kngwyu) - I think I will have to backport a bugfix `0.12.4` and yank the rest of the `0.12` releases.

Sorry, something went wrong.

More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.
