Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the required buffer size when compressing data using gzip. Specifically, the code did not properly account for the worst-case expansion of the gzip algorithm.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect buffer size calculation**: The code allocated a buffer that was potentially too small to hold the compressed data, especially when the input data could expand due to the gzip compression algorithm.
- **Potential Buffer Overflow:** If the compressed data exceeded the allocated buffer size, a buffer overflow could occur, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A buffer overflow could potentially lead to a crash of the application. It is also possible that memory corruption could be exploited for more serious impacts, such as arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is providing a specific input to the `flb_gzip_compress` function that would result in the compressed data exceeding the buffer size calculated by the flawed logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to provide arbitrary data that is passed to the `flb_gzip_compress` function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Github commit `cadff53c093210404aed01c4cf586adb8caa07af` addresses the issue by calculating the maximum compressed size correctly, considering the worst-case expansion of the gzip algorithm, including a 10-byte header, 8-byte footer, maximum input expansion and the original input length
- The fluentbit.io release notes for v1.6.4 explicitly mentions "gzip: fix compression size calculation (oss-fuzz 27261)" indicating the fix for this CVE.
- This vulnerability was found by the oss-fuzz project.
