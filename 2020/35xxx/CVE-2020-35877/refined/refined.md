Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-35877:

**It's important to note that the provided content primarily discusses CVE-2020-35878, not CVE-2020-35877. However, RUSTSEC-2020-0022 lists both CVEs as aliases, indicating they are related to the same underlying issue. Thus, CVE-2020-35878 is the focus of the extracted information, while also referencing CVE-2020-35877.**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is in the `ozone` crate for Rust. It stems from two main issues:
    - **Dropping of uninitialized memory:**  The code in `src/map.rs` contains a flaw where uninitialized memory is dropped.
    - **Out-of-bounds access:** The code in `src/buffer.rs` has an out-of-bounds access vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory safety violation due to dropping uninitialized memory.
- Out-of-bounds access, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** High - Unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.
- **Integrity:** High - Unauthorized modification of data.
- **Availability:** High - Potential for application crash or denial of service.
- Overall, the impact is rated as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Attack Complexity:** Low, meaning it is relatively easy to exploit.
- **Privileges Required:** None, no special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** None, no user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the `ozone` crate up to and including 0.1.0 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** No patched versions are available.
- **CWEs:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource).

**Summary of Key Points:**

The `ozone` crate for Rust is vulnerable to memory safety issues arising from out-of-bounds access and the dropping of uninitialized memory. This allows an attacker with network access to potentially achieve unauthorized data access, corruption, and denial of service. No special user interaction or privileges are required. The issue is considered critical.
