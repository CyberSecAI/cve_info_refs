Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issue:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35669 (Although not explicitly stated, the issue #511 in the dart-lang/http repository is highly likely to correspond to this CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `Request` class in the `dart-lang/http` library does not validate the HTTP method verb provided by the user. It passes the verb as-is to the underlying stream without any sanitization or checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Header Injection:** Because the method verb is not validated, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request by including them within the "method" string.
- **Path Forgery:** The attacker can manipulate the path used by the request by injecting a path inside the method verb, potentially redirecting the request to an unintended target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection/Proxy Manipulation:** An attacker can use header injection and path forgery to redirect requests, potentially through a reverse proxy, to malicious or attacker-controlled servers. This enables an attacker to steal tokens/cookies that are sent along with the request.
- **Information Disclosure/Data Theft:** If a reverse proxy forwards requests without properly sanitizing the path or header information, this could lead to information disclosure by exposing the application to an attacker.
- **Bypassing Security Controls:** Injected headers can potentially bypass access controls or other security mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker provides a crafted method verb as input to the `Request` constructor, including malicious headers and an alternate path.
- The application uses `Request` with this malicious method and sends the crafted request to the server through a reverse proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `method` parameter passed to the `Request` object.
- The application using the library must be using the Request object with user controlled input for the method, and be behind a proxy.

**Technical Details:**
The issue demonstrates how an attacker can inject a method string like `"GET http://example.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\nLLAMA:"`, which leads to the following request structure:

```
GET HTTP://EXAMPLE.COM/ HTTP/1.1
HOST: EXAMPLE.COM
LLAMA: /llama HTTP/1.1
user-agent: Dart/2.10 (dart:io)
accept-encoding: gzip
content-length: 0
host: localhost
```

Here, the injected "LLAMA:" header causes a redirect via the proxy to `example.com`. In this case, `example.com` is a demonstration, but it could be any other malicious server.

The report also mentions that "especially in case there is a reverse proxy is in place," the impact is quite important. A proxy might pass the request with the forged path to an arbitrary host.
