# Header injection and path forgery [security issue] #511

## Description

![@n0npax](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10343861?v=4&size=48)[n0npax](https://github.com/n0npax)opened [on Dec 23, 2020](https://github.com/dart-lang/http/issues/511#issue-773674973)

I believe there is a security issue with the current implementation of `Request`.

The full example can be found [here](https://github.com/n0npax/dart-test-http)

## What's wrong:

`Request` is passing method verb as is to the stream without any kind of validation.

basically:

```
  var r = Request(
      "GET http://example.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\nLLAMA:",
      Uri(scheme: "http", path: "/llama", host: "localhost"));
  var rs = await r.send();
```

generates request like:

```
sudo nc -l 127.0.0.1 80
GET HTTP://EXAMPLE.COM/ HTTP/1.1
HOST: EXAMPLE.COM
LLAMA: /llama HTTP/1.1
user-agent: Dart/2.10 (dart:io)
accept-encoding: gzip
content-length: 0
host: localhost
```
## What I'd expect

If HTTP verb(method) is not a part of the known set of verbs (GET/PUT/HEAD/...) I'd expect an exception to be thrown

## Why this is a security risk

If the developer is using `Request` to abstract generating HTTP calls and he's accepting a `method` param from the user, the user can do some magic like header injection or path forgery.

This can be exploited in many ways and seems to be quite important *especially in case there is a reverse proxy is in place*. A proxy may just pass someone's request to any host.

By running [snippet](https://github.com/n0npax/dart-test-http) behind a proxy, I was nicely redirected([like this](https://github.com/n0npax/dart-test-http#critical-path)) to `example.com` which was injected as per the example above.

Let's assume I'm replacing `example.com` with `my-hackery-uservice.org` and the victim is working in a company behind the proxy. This means I can redirect calls with headers/cookies(tokens) and blah blah blah.
