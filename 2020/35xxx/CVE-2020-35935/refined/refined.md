CVE-2020-35935: Authenticated Authorization Bypass and Privilege Escalation in Advanced Access Manager

- Root Cause: The AAM_Backend_Manager::profileUpdate method, triggered by the profile_update and user_register actions, lacked a standard capability check.
- Weakness: Failure to perform proper capability checks when assigning roles during profile updates. Relies on deprecated user-level attributes for role filtering.
- Impact: Low-privileged users could assign themselves or switch to any role with an equal or lesser user level, or any role that did not have an assigned user level. This could lead to privilege escalation and potential site takeover.
- Attack Vector: Sending a POST request to wp-admin/profile.php with typical profile update parameters and appending a aam_user_roles[] parameter set to the role they would like to use.
- Required Capabilities: A low-privileged user account and the 'Multiple Roles Support' setting must be enabled. The target role must either lack a user-level attribute or have a user-level attribute equal to or less than the attacker's.
