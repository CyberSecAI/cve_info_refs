Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `ref_no` parameter of the Courier Management System 1.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `ref_no` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:** The specific type of SQL injection is time-based blind, meaning the attacker infers information by observing delays introduced by the injected SQL statements using `SLEEP()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database contents, including sensitive information such as user credentials, financial data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/ajax.php?action=save_branch` endpoint.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `ref_no` parameter in the POST data to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Application Access:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate and access to the new branch creation page.
- **Tools:** The attacker requires tools such as Burp Suite and SQLMap to perform the injection.
- **SQL knowledge:** The attacker must know SQL to craft payloads that retrieve database content, as the payload used was `ref_no=123' AND (SELECT 5575 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ngIo) AND 'knst'='knst`
