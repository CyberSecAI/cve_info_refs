Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The All in One SEO Pack plugin for WordPress did not properly sanitize user input in the SEO title and SEO description fields within post meta data. This lack of sanitization allowed users with contributor-level access or higher to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious scripts injected into the SEO fields were stored in the database and executed when a user accessed the 'all posts' page in the WordPress admin panel.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to sanitize the SEO title and description fields, allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to be stored.
*   **Insecure Display of User Data:** The plugin displayed the unsanitized SEO meta data on the 'all posts' page, leading to script execution. Additionally, scripts could be executed when viewing the post directly if a closing tag was used to break out of the existing script tag

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Site Takeover:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete site takeover if an administrator's browser executed the injected script. This could allow an attacker to inject backdoors, create new administrative accounts, and gain full control of the website.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could perform a variety of malicious actions, including redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing session cookies, and defacing the website.
*   **Data Theft:** Exploitation could also be used to steal sensitive data from the website, including user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is in the All in One SEO Pack plugin itself.
*   **User Input:**  The malicious code is injected through the plugin's SEO meta fields in the post editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Account:** An attacker needs a WordPress user account with at least contributor-level privileges.
*   **Ability to Create/Edit Posts:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit posts.
*   **Targeted User:** The injected script will be executed when any user, especially an admin or editor, visits the 'all posts' page.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is considered medium severity.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.6.2 of the All in One SEO Pack plugin.
*   Wordfence premium users received a firewall rule to block attacks on the day of discovery and free users received the rule after thirty days.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by including a closing script tag before the injected script. This is because the SEO description is placed within a script tag, so the closing tag would complete that original tag and allow a new script to start.
