Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication checks in the Hospital Management System version 4.0. Specifically, the application does not properly verify user authentication before granting access to the admin portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can access the administrative interface without providing any valid credentials.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By accessing the admin portal, an attacker gains elevated privileges, allowing them to perform administrative actions on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** An attacker gains complete access to the admin portal, potentially enabling them to:
    *   View and modify patient, doctor, and user information.
    *   Alter appointment schedules.
    *   Access sensitive queries.
    *   View doctor and user login logs.
    *   Generate reports.
    *   Perform other administrative functions.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive patient and medical data could be exposed or altered.
*   **Service Disruption:** The attacker could potentially disrupt or disable services provided by the hospital management system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Admin Portal:** The attacker directly accesses the admin portal without needing to bypass any authentication mechanisms.
*   **Web-Based Attack:** Exploitation occurs through a web interface, suggesting that the vulnerability can be accessed via a browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web application's URL over the network.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They can access the admin portal without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable software is identified as "Hospital Management System â€” 4.0 of PHPGURUKUL".
*   The system uses PHP and a MySQL database.
*   The application has 3 modules: Admin, User, and Doctor, with the admin module being the vulnerable one in this case.
