The content is related to CVE-2020-35912.

**Root Cause:**
The `lock_api` crate had unsound implementations of the `Send` or `Sync` traits for certain lock guard objects. Specifically, `MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, and `RwLockWriteGuard` incorrectly allowed these guards to be used with types that were not thread-safe, leading to potential data races.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect `Send` and `Sync` trait implementations on lock guard objects.
- Allowing non-`Send` types to cross thread boundaries within safe Rust code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data races can occur when multiple threads access and modify shared data without proper synchronization, leading to undefined behavior, memory corruption, and program crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation involves using the affected lock guard objects (`MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, `RwLockWriteGuard`) with non-`Send` types and moving these objects between threads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to use the `lock_api` crate and be able to create multi-threaded applications.
- The attacker also needs to be able to pass a non `Send` type into a guard in a multi-threaded context.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was resolved by changing the trait bounds on the `Mapped` guard types and removing the `Sync` trait for the `RwLock` guards.
- The vulnerability was patched in version `0.4.2` of the `lock_api` crate.
- The advisory also lists aliases for this issue (CVE-2020-35910, CVE-2020-35911, CVE-2020-35913, CVE-2020-35914).
