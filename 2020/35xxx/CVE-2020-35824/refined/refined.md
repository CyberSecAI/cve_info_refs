The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It does not relate to CVE-2020-35824, as the advisory is related to NETGEAR PSV-2018-0501.

Here's the extracted information related to the XSS vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means malicious script can be injected and stored on the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory does not specify the exact impact, but XSS vulnerabilities can lead to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement
   - Redirection to malicious sites
   - Theft of sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- Not explicitly detailed, but XSS is commonly exploited by injecting malicious code in a field that is then stored by the application, and subsequently rendered to the user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into a vulnerable input field that is later stored by the router's web interface, and then is rendered to other users interacting with it. The exact capabilities depend on the specific vulnerable endpoint.
- The CVSS vector indicates a high level of access is required (PR:H)
