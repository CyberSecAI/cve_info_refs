### Description

`GenericMutexGuard<T>` was given the `Sync` auto trait as long as `T` is `Send`
due to its contained members. However, since the guard is supposed to represent
an **acquired lock** and allows concurrent access to the underlying data from
different threads, it should only be `Sync` when the underlying data is.

This is a soundness issue and allows data races, potentially leading to crashes
and segfaults from safe Rust code.

The flaw was corrected by adding a `T: Send + Sync` bound for
`GenericMutexGuard`'s `Sync` trait.

This bug is [similar to one](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41622) in
`std::sync::Mutex`.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Oct 31, 2020](https://github.com/Matthias247/futures-intrusive/issues/53#issue-733790089)

I think the `GenericMutexGuard` object should me marked explicitly as `!Sync`, it looks like it was automatically given the `Sync` trait because it only consists of a `GenericMutex` reference which itself is `Sync`. However, the lock-guard object itself shouldn't be usable across threads because it assumes it has the lock acquired. (This issue was found by the Rust group at [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)).

Here's a demonstration of how this can cause `Cell`, a non-Sync but Sendable type to be used across threads to create a data race:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use futures_intrusive::sync::{GenericMutexGuard, Mutex};

use crossbeam_utils::thread;
use std::cell::Cell;

static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
    enum RefOrInt<'a> {
        Ref(&'a u64),
        Int(u64),
    }
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));

    let futures_mutex: Mutex<Cell<_>> = Mutex::new(cell, false);
    let mutex_guard: GenericMutexGuard<_, Cell<_>> = futures_mutex.try_lock().unwrap();

    thread::scope(|s| {
        let guard_ref = &mutex_guard;
        let child = s.spawn(move |_| {
            let smuggled = &(**guard_ref);

            println!("In the thread: {:p} {:?}", smuggled, *smuggled);
            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        println!("In main: {:p} {:?}", &(*mutex_guard), *mutex_guard);
        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = mutex_guard.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 {
                    continue;
                }

                // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

Output:

```
In main: 0x7ffc45082668 Cell { value: Ref(123) }
In the thread: 0x7ffc45082668 Cell { value: Ref(123) }
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef
Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```
