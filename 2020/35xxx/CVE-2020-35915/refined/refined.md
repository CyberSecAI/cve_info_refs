Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35915:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `GenericMutexGuard<T>` in the `futures-intrusive` crate was incorrectly given the `Sync` auto trait as long as `T` was `Send`. This was due to the contained members of the guard itself being `Sync`, but the guard object itself represents an acquired lock and should only be `Sync` when the underlying data (`T`) is also `Sync`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the incorrect implementation of the `Sync` trait for `GenericMutexGuard`. It allows concurrent access to the underlying data from different threads when the data itself is not thread-safe (i.e., when T is not Sync). This leads to data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to data races. This can result in:
- Crashes and segfaults from otherwise safe Rust code.
- Undefined behavior when non-Sync types are accessed concurrently from multiple threads.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to run code using the vulnerable library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to introduce code that uses the `futures-intrusive` crate and its `GenericMutexGuard`.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, as the vulnerability can be triggered from low-privileged code.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is similar to a known issue in `std::sync::Mutex`
- The fix involves adding a `T: Send + Sync` bound for `GenericMutexGuard`'s `Sync` trait, ensuring that the guard is only `Sync` if the underlying data is also `Sync`.
- A code example demonstrates the data race using a `Cell` (which is `Send` but not `Sync`) to show how the guard can cause issues.
