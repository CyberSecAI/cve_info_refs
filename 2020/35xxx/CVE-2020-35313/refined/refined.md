Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2020-35313** is related to multiple vulnerabilities discovered in WonderCMS 3.1.3, specifically:

**1. Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the theme/plugin installer feature. The CMS downloads plugins from a user-provided URL and extracts them to a predictable location on the server.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Unrestricted file upload/download through the installer functionality.
    *   Predictable extraction path for downloaded ZIP files.
    *   Lack of sanitization/validation of downloaded files, allowing the inclusion of malicious PHP code within plugin ZIP archives.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can upload a malicious plugin containing a PHP backdoor. After installation, this backdoor can be accessed directly, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker needs valid admin credentials to log in to the CMS.
    *   The attacker uses the theme/plugin installer to upload a crafted malicious plugin.
    *   The attacker accesses the injected backdoor via a direct URL path.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must have valid admin credentials to log in.

**2. Authenticated Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `addCustomThemePluginRepository` function within the theme/plugin installer feature has insufficient URL validation. It uses `strpos` to check for `https://github.com/` or `https://gitlab.com/` in the provided URL, which is easily bypassed.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Weak validation using `strpos` which only checks if a string exists in URL, not if it starts with them.
    *   The filter logic allows for arbitrary URLs as long as it contains either `"https://github.com/"` or `"https://gitlab.com/"`.
    *   The SSRF is blind, meaning the response is not directly visible.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can make requests to internal or external services by controlling the URL.
    *   Using the Gopher protocol an attacker can interact with internal network services like FastCGI to execute commands on the server and obtain a reverse shell.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker needs valid admin credentials to log in to the CMS.
    *   The attacker uses the custom plugin repository feature, bypassing the intended URL filter.
    *   The attacker uses the `gopher://` scheme within the URL to send commands to FastCGI running on the server.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must have valid admin credentials to log in.
    *   FastCGI must be configured to listen on a TCP port (default is a socket).

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**

The attacker with admin access can achieve RCE in two ways: directly through a crafted plugin or by exploiting a blind SSRF to interact with internal services. The vulnerabilities lie in the lack of proper input validation and security checks in the plugin installer functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is more detailed than the typical CVE description, including code snippets, attack scenarios, and exploit scripts.
*   The exploits for these vulnerabilities are available on Exploit-DB.
*   The blog post details how to generate a Gopher payload using the "Gopherus" tool.
*   The author mentions that the SSRF vulnerability also affects the `installUpdateThemePluginAction` function, making it even easier to exploit because there is no filtering on the destination URL.
