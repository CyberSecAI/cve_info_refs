Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-35305

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames entered through the 'New Page' dialog in Gollum. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the filename parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically reflected XSS because the injected code gets reflected back to the user's browser from the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view the Gollum wiki's Overview or Pages. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, data theft, and website defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious filename, specifically using a string containing JavaScript. This is done when creating a new page through the "New Page" dialog.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create a new page within the Gollum wiki. No special privileges or user account is needed. The attacker needs to use the New Page dialog to specify the filename.
- The attacker needs to create a page with a malicious filename, which when displayed on the overview or pages views will execute JavaScript.
- User interaction is required, as the victim needs to view the affected page.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in Gollum versions 5.0 up to 5.1.1.
- Version 5.1.2 and later are not affected, due to added sanitization.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tsubasa Umeuchi (@Szarny).
- The fix involved sanitizing displayed page names and adding regression tests.
- The vulnerability has a moderate severity score.
