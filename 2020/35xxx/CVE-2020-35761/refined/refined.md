Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-35761:

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content describes a specific vulnerability found in bloofoxCMS, identified as an "Authenticated RXSS in 'fileurl' parameter". This aligns with a typical vulnerability that would be assigned a CVE. While the CVE-ID is a placeholder, the description and PoC strongly suggest this is the vulnerability that would be identified by a CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `fileurl` parameter within the bloofoxCMS application. The application directly uses the user-provided input in the HTML output, without encoding it.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The specific vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS). This means that malicious JavaScript code injected into the `fileurl` parameter is reflected back in the response and executed within the user's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML/JS code within the context of the victim's browser. This allows an attacker to perform actions such as:
    *   Stealing cookies, which can lead to session hijacking.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `fileurl` parameter.
    *   The user must be authenticated to access the vulnerable functionality, and click the link.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick an authenticated user into clicking it.
    *   The attacker does not need direct access to the server but needs to induce a victim to click the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided PoC shows the use of a simple `<script>alert(1)</script>` payload, but the vulnerability is exploitable with more sophisticated Javascript code.
*   The recommended fix is to use the `htmlspecialchars` function in PHP to encode user input before displaying it in the web page, preventing the browser from interpreting it as code.

In summary, the content describes a clear case of an authenticated reflected XSS vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization, which fits the type of vulnerability that a CVE would be assigned for.
