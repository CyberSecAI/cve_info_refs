This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. This suggests that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being stored and later displayed within the web interface of the affected routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected pages,

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to:

*   Session hijacking
*   Account compromise
*   Malware distribution
*   Phishing attacks

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected routers. An attacker could inject malicious scripts via a vulnerable input field on the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the router, likely through network access to the device.  They need to be able to inject the malicious script into a vulnerable input field. The CVSS vector indicates the attacker must have local access to the network (AV:A), have low privileges (PR:L), and that user interaction is required (UI:R) for successful exploitation.
