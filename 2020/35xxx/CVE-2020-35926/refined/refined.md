{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nanorand` library, prior to version 0.5.1, used bit-shifting to truncate 64-bit numbers when generating random numbers for standard unsigned integers instead of a simple `as` conversion. This improper truncation led to incorrect random number generation, often resulting in the RNG returning only 0.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper random number generation due to incorrect truncation of 64-bit numbers.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability causes the random number generators to return biased or predictable outputs, potentially leading to security issues in cryptographic applications that rely on the library. In some cases, the RNG would always return 0, including the cryptographically secure `ChaCha` generator.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to use applications that rely on the vulnerable version of `nanorand`. No special privileges or user interaction are required."
