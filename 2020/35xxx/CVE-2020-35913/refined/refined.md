Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35913:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the unsound implementation of the `Send` or `Sync` traits for specific lock guard objects in the `lock_api` crate. These objects, namely `MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, and `RwLockWriteGuard`, did not properly restrict their usage across threads. This allowed for data races via types that were not safe to be sent across thread boundaries in safe Rust code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the incorrect implementation of the `Send` and `Sync` traits for the mentioned lock guard types. This allowed for unsafe concurrent access to data, potentially resulting in data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to data races, which can cause unpredictable behavior, memory corruption, and potentially denial of service. It is not specified what data is being corrupted, therefore it is hard to quantify the impact. 

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves leveraging the flawed lock guards in a multithreaded context. Specifically, by using a type that is not safe to send between threads, it is possible to cause a race condition. This makes the attack vector local.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker needs to be able to introduce a scenario where these flawed lock guard objects are used in a multithreaded program. They would also need to be able to use a type that is not safe to Send between threads, and then trigger a race condition.

**Summary of relevant information:**

- Affected Crate: `lock_api`
- Vulnerable Components: `MappedMutexGuard`, `MappedRwLockReadGuard`, `MappedRwLockWriteGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`, and `RwLockWriteGuard`
- Weakness: Incorrect `Send` and `Sync` trait implementations.
- Impact: Data races and potential memory corruption or denial of service.
- Attack Vector: Multithreaded use of the flawed lock guards.
- Fix: The trait bounds on the `Mapped` guard types were changed, and the `Sync` trait was removed for the `RwLock` guards.
- Patched version: `>=0.4.2`
