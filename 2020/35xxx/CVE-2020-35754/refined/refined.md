Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when editing language translations within the administration panel of Quick.Cms and Quick.Cart systems. This allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP code into language variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **PHP Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code. This is a classic example of a code injection vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The software fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input in the language editing feature before storing and processing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Complete Website Compromise:**  This can lead to a complete website compromise, including data theft, defacement, malware injection, or other malicious activities.
- **Server Takeover:** In some cases, the attacker could gain control of the server if the underlying system is also vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the administration panel of the affected applications.
- **Language Editing Feature:**  The vulnerability is specifically located in the language editing/translation functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a legitimate user who has successfully logged into the administration panel of Quick.Cms or Quick.Cart.
- **Access to Language Editing:** The attacker must have privileges to access and modify language variables/translations.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a PHP code injection flaw caused by insufficient input sanitization when editing language variables within the admin panel of Quick.Cms and Quick.Cart. An authenticated attacker with appropriate privileges can exploit it to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to a full website compromise. The vendor has released a security fix addressing this.
