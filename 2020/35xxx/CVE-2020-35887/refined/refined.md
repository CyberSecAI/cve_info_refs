Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-35887, extracted from the content:

**It's important to note that the primary CVE discussed in the provided content is CVE-2020-35888.  CVE-2020-35887 is listed as an alias for the same issue.**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `arr` crate in Rust has multiple underlying issues that, when combined, create a significant security risk. The issues are:
   -  Incorrect implementation of `Sync` and `Send` traits.
   - Lack of array bounds checking in `Index` and `IndexMut` implementations.
    - `Array::new_from_template()` drops uninitialized memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Sync/Send Bounds:** The crate allows non-`Sync` and non-`Send` types to be passed across thread boundaries. This violates Rust's safety guarantees, potentially leading to data races and undefined behavior.
2.  **Missing Array Bounds Checks:** The `Index` and `IndexMut` traits, used for accessing array elements, do not validate if the given index is within the valid array bounds. This allows for out-of-bounds reads and writes, which may lead to memory corruption or crashes.
3.  **Uninitialized Memory Drop:** The `Array::new_from_template()` function can drop uninitialized memory. This may result in use of invalid data or undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Races:** Incorrect `Sync`/`Send` implementations can lead to data races, resulting in unpredictable program behavior, data corruption, and potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Missing bounds checks in index access can corrupt memory, leading to crashes, exploitable bugs, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Uninitialized Memory:** Dropping uninitialized memory could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Although the specific attack vector isn't explicitly detailed in the provided text, the CVSS metrics indicate a network attack vector, likely meaning that a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by causing the vulnerable code to be executed with crafted inputs that trigger the memory corruption issues.
*   **Local:** An attacker could also exploit the vulnerabilities locally if they have the ability to execute code that uses the vulnerable `arr` crate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to either control the input that is passed to functions using the vulnerable `arr` crate or directly execute code that uses the `arr` crate.
* No specific user interaction or privileges are required to trigger these issues.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates a "Critical" severity rating for these issues.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions `<= 0.6.1` of the `arr` crate.
*   There are no patched versions available.
*   The advisory has been reviewed by GitHub.
*   The text refers to CVE-2020-35886, CVE-2020-35887, and CVE-2020-35888 as aliases for the same underlying issue. The primary focus of the provided content is CVE-2020-35888.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, with high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
