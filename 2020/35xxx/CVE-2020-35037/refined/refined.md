Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-35037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Events Manager plugin, in versions prior to 5.9.8, failed to properly sanitize and escape specific search parameters before outputting them in the page, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically when handling search parameters. The plugin wasn't adequately sanitizing or escaping user-supplied input within the search functionality, making it possible to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the affected pages.
- This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Cookie theft
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the `em_search` or `search` parameters in the URL or POST request.
- An attacker would craft a malicious URL or form with injected JavaScript and get a user to visit this link (or submit the form) while logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to get a user to interact with the malicious crafted URL or form.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.9.8 of the Events Manager plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jakob Wierzba.
- The specific code changes related to the fix include the sanitization and escaping of the search parameters. This is done by removing 'format', 'format_header', and 'format_footer' from the accepted search parameters and by using `esc_url_raw` and `sanitize_text_field` functions on user-supplied values in the `em-event-location-url.php` file.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS score is 3.8 (Low) with vectors AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
