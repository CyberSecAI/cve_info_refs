Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-35493:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `bfd_pef_parse_function_stubs` function within the `bfd/pef.c` file of GNU Binutils.
- It stems from an improper length check before calling `bfd_pef_parse_function_stub()`. A check `if ((codepos + 4) > codelen)` is performed, but the subsequent call to `bfd_pef_parse_function_stub()` uses a fixed length of 24, potentially reading beyond the `codebuf` buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The improper length check allows the `bfd_pef_parse_function_stub()` function to write past the allocated buffer, corrupting heap memory.
- Out-of-bounds read: The attempt to read 24 bytes for function stub processing can read past the end of the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The heap buffer overflow can cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Unspecified impact: The vulnerability could also lead to other unspecified impacts depending on the memory layout and the specific actions performed by the program.
- Potential disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted PEF file: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted PEF file to a vulnerable tool, such as `objdump`, that uses the affected Binutils library.
- Local Attack Vector: The attacker needs to have access to execute `objdump` or a similar tool on a file of their choosing. This can be done by having access to the local machine, or by tricking a user into processing a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft PEF files: The attacker must be capable of creating PEF files that trigger the vulnerable code path.
- Ability to execute objdump: The attacker must have the ability to execute `objdump` or similar vulnerable utility on the crafted PEF file. This can be achieved by local access to the target machine, or by providing the malicous file to a user for processing.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability affects GNU Binutils versions prior to 2.34.
- The vulnerability is present in the handling of PEF (Preferred Executable Format) files.
- Patches were backported to older versions of some distributions.
- NetApp products using the vulnerable versions of GNU Binutils were also affected, including NetApp Cloud Backup, NetApp HCI Compute Node, NetApp SolidFire, and ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8's GCC Toolset 10 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 10 are not affected because they shipped with the patch already applied.
