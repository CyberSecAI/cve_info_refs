Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35381:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `jsonparser` library for Go, specifically in how it handles path traversal when using the `GET` call, which can lead to a slice bounds out of range error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Slice Bounds Out of Range:** The core issue is that a malformed or unexpected path provided to the `GetString` or `Get` function can cause a slice operation to access memory outside of allocated bounds, resulting in a runtime panic.
-   **Malformed Path Traversal:** The vulnerability is triggered when the provided path for accessing fields within the JSON structure is not correctly handled, leading to an attempt to access an invalid memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The out-of-bounds access results in a panic, causing the application using the vulnerable `jsonparser` library to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malformed JSON Path:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a crafted, malformed JSON path to the `GET` call of the library. The path doesn't have to be a valid JSON, but rather can cause out-of-bounds access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Control over JSON Path:** The attacker must have control or influence over the JSON path that is provided to the vulnerable function of the `jsonparser` library.
-   **Application Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable application to process a crafted JSON with the exploit path

**Additional Information from the Content:**

-   The vulnerability was identified in `jsonparser` version 1.0.0 and fixed in version 1.1.1.
-   The fix was applied in Fedora updates for both Fedora 32 and Fedora 33.
-   The vulnerability is triggered by using the `GetString` function or the underlying `Get` function with a malformed path.
-   The issue is tracked upstream at  <https://github.com/buger/jsonparser/issues/219>
-   Red Hat Bugzilla entry for this issue is <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1908451>
- The severity was deemed low, because the attacker needs to control the path, not just the JSON.
