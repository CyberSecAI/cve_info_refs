Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35634:

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-35634 is a vulnerability within the CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) specifically in the Nef polygon parsing functionality. It involves an out-of-bounds read that can lead to code execution.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a lack of proper bounds checking when parsing Nef polygon data. Specifically, the `SNC_io_parser::read_sface()` function reads an index from the input file and uses it to access the `SLoop_of` vector through `sfh->boundary_entry_objects()`, without validating if the index is within the bounds of the vector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_sface()` when accessing `sfh->boundary_entry_objects()`, `SLoop_of`.
*   **Type Confusion:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to type confusion, which allows an attacker to corrupt data and potentially gain control over program execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a specially designed malformed `.nef` file or similar format that, when parsed by CGAL, triggers the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted malformed input to an application that uses the vulnerable CGAL library. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    *   Uploading the file to a vulnerable web application.
    *   Providing the file to a command-line application.
    *   Manipulating a file used by the application.
    *   Remote access to a vulnerable system

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs in the following code snippet within the `read_sface()` function:

```c++
  while(isdigit(cc)) {
    in.putback(cc);
    in >> index;
    sfh->boundary_entry_objects().push_back(make_object(SLoop_of[index]));
```
The `index` variable, read directly from the input stream, is used to access the `SLoop_of` vector without any validation on its range, potentially reading outside the allocated buffer.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**
* The provided content references multiple CVEs related to CGAL. These CVEs have similar root causes in how they parse the input data
* The Talos report includes a CVSS v3 score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
* The Gentoo advisory indicates that all users of CGAL should upgrade to version 5.4.1 or later.
* The Debian LTS advisory recommends upgrading to version 4.13-1+deb10u1 for Debian 10 users.
