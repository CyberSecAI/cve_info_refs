Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `AdminMsgSystemController.java` component of the inxedu project.
- Specifically, the `delsystemmsg` function is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability occurs because user-supplied input (`ids` parameter) is not sanitized when constructing the SQL query in `MsgSystemMapper.xml`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly includes user-provided input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
- This includes potential for:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive data stored in the database
    - Data modification/deletion: Altering or destroying data
    - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining administrative privileges within the database system
    - Denial of Service: Exploiting database performance via heavy queries (like sleep() used in PoC)

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the `/admin/letter/delsystem/` endpoint.
- The `ids` parameter in the URL is used to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being bypassed but the attacker is required to access the admin panel which may imply admin privileges
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL injection payload to include in the `ids` parameter
- The provided POC shows the use of `sleep()` to test the SQL injection vulnerability.
