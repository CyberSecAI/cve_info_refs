Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-35490:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the mishandling of the interaction between serialization gadgets and polymorphic type handling in FasterXML jackson-databind. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource` class.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Serialization Gadgets:** The core issue is the presence of "gadget" classes that can be exploited during deserialization to perform unintended operations. These gadgets are classes with specific methods that, when called in a certain order via setters/fields, can lead to malicious actions.
- **Polymorphic Type Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered when Jackson's polymorphic type handling is enabled, especially when using class names as type identifiers and when the nominal type is a broad type like `java.lang.Object`, `java.util.Serializable` or `java.util.Comparable`. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary class (including a gadget class) for deserialization.
- **Inadequate Blocklisting:**  Vulnerable versions of Jackson-databind do not block known gadget classes such as `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious JSON payload containing a gadget class, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting certain gadgets may lead to denial of service, as seen in the example with the `Bomb` class that shuts down the JVM.
- **Data Disclosure:** Some gadgets can expose sensitive information from the file system of the server handling deserialization.
- **Data Modification:** Maliciously crafted payloads can potentially modify data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Untrusted JSON Input:** The primary attack vector is through the deserialization of untrusted JSON data provided by an attacker.
- **Network:** The attacker can send the malicious JSON payload over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to send JSON:** The attacker needs to be able to send a JSON payload to a vulnerable server/application.
- **Knowledge of Gadget Classes:** The attacker needs to know about the existence of a suitable gadget class in the application's classpath, specifically one which is not blocked by jackson-databind.
- **Polymorphic Typing Enabled:** The vulnerable application must have polymorphic type handling enabled, either through annotations on the property or through default typing, especially when using class names as type identifiers and `java.lang.Object`, `java.util.Serializable`, or `java.util.Comparable` as the base type for properties.
- **Vulnerable Version of Jackson:** The application must use a vulnerable version of `jackson-databind` (prior to 2.9.10.8) that does not block the specific gadget class used in the attack.
- **No user interaction is required**

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a detailed explanation of polymorphic typing in Jackson and how it can be exploited with serialization gadgets. It also notes that jackson-databind is being updated to block known gadget types.
- The NetApp advisory lists multiple products affected by this vulnerability and indicates that a patch is available for some products, while others are marked as won't fix due to end of life status.
- The Github advisory mentions `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource` as the specific class related to this CVE.
