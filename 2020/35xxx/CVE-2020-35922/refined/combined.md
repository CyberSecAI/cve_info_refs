## Package

cargo

mio
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.7.0, < 0.7.6

## Patched versions

0.7.6

## Description

The mio crate has assumed std::net::SocketAddrV4 and std::net::SocketAddrV6 have the same memory layout as the system C representation sockaddr. It has simply casted the pointers to convert the socket addresses to the system representation. The standard library does not say anything about the memory layout, and this will cause invalid memory access if the standard library changes the implementation. No warnings or errors will be emitted once the change happens.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

|  | SocketAddr::V4(ref addr) => ( |
| --- | --- |
|  | addr as \*const \_ as \*const libc::sockaddr, |
|  | size\_of\_val(addr) as libc::socklen\_t, |

|  | addr as \*const \_ as \*const libc::sockaddr, |
|  | size\_of\_val(addr) as libc::socklen\_t, |
|  | ), |

As far as I can tell there are no guarantees from `std` about the layout of `SocketAddrV{4,6}`, and this code could silently compile and cause UB elsewhere if the representation changes (e.g. if padding is added early on in the struct, resulting in C code reading uninitialized bytes).
