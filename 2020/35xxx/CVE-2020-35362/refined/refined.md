Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `dext5handler.jsp` file of DEXT5Upload, specifically within its file download functionality.
*   Insufficient verification of the download paths allows arbitrary file downloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Path Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the file paths provided in the download request parameters. This enables attackers to specify arbitrary file paths outside the intended directory and download sensitive files.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability exploits direct object references by manipulating parameters like `fileVirtualPath` to access files it should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download any file accessible by the web server, potentially exposing sensitive information like source code, configuration files, database credentials, or user data. This could result in data breaches, unauthorized access, or further exploitation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP GET or POST requests to the `dext5handler.jsp` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable DEXT5Upload instance.
*   **Understanding of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of the HTTP requests and the relevant parameters like `dext5CMD`, `fileVirtualPath`, and `fileOrgName` to craft a malicious request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Parameters involved:**

*   `dext5CMD` with the value `downloadRequest` is a trigger parameter
*   `fileVirtualPath` allows for specifying the path of the file to be downloaded.
*   `fileOrgName` appears to be related to the downloaded file but not the path

The content confirms the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-35362, which is a file download vulnerability in DEXT5Upload due to insufficient verification of download paths.
