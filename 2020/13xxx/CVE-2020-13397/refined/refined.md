Here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2020-13397 found in the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the `security_fips_decrypt` function located in `libfreerdp/core/security.c`.
*   The OOB read occurs due to an uninitialized value which is later used in `winpr_Cipher_Update`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Out-of-bounds read.
*   Use of an uninitialized value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker could potentially cause FreeRDP to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   The vulnerability may also enable arbitrary code execution. (This is mentioned in the Ubuntu security notice, but not explicitly confirmed in the other sources)
*   The GitHub advisory mentions a low severity and low EPSS score.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A malicious RDP server could send crafted data that triggers the vulnerability in the FreeRDP client.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the decryption process in security_fips_decrypt.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to control the RDP server or be in a man-in-the-middle position to send a malicious payload.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with a vulnerable FreeRDP client.

**Additional notes:**
*   The `rdp` struct is initialized with `calloc`, which sets uninitialized pointers to NULL, so a NULL check was used as a fix.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in FreeRDP version 2.1.1.
*   The fix was introduced in commit `d6cd14059b257318f176c0ba3ee0a348826a9ef8`
