# Kerberos

The `kerberos` package is a C++ extension for Node.js that provides cross-platform support for kerberos authentication using GSSAPI on linux/osx, and SSPI on windows. Much of the code in this module is adapted from [ccs-kerberos](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pykerberos) and [winkerberos](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/winkerberos).

### Requirements

**Linux**

* `python` v2.7
* `make`
* A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* Distribution-specific kerberos packages (e.g. `krb5-dev` on Ubuntu)

**macOS**

* `Xcode Command Line Tools`: Can be installed with `xcode-select --install`
* Distribution-specific kerberos packages (e.g. `krb5` on Homebrew)

**Windows**

* **Option 1:** Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) by running `npm install -g windows-build-tools` from an elevated PowerShell (run as Administrator).
* **Option 2:** Install dependencies and configuration manually

  1. Visual C++ Build Environment:
  + **Option 1:** Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126) using the *Default Install* option.
  + **Option 2:** Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or modify an existing installation) and select *Common Tools for Visual C++* during setup.
  > 💡 [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)

  2. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Miniconda 2.7](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) (`v3.x.x` is not supported), and run `npm config set python python2.7`
  3. Launch cmd, `npm config set msvs_version 2015`

### MongoDB Node.js Driver Version Compatibility

Only the following version combinations with the [MongoDB Node.js Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) are considered stable.

|  | `kerberos@1.x` | `kerberos@2.x` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mongodb@6.x` | N/A | ✓ |
| `mongodb@5.x` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `mongodb@4.x` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `mongodb@3.x` | ✓ | N/A |

### Installation

Now you can install `kerberos` with the following:

```
npm install kerberos
```

#### Prebuild Platforms

Below are the platforms that are available as prebuilds on each github release.
`prebuild-install` downloads these automatically depending on the platform you are running npm install on.

* Linux GLIBC 2.23 or later
  + s390x
  + arm64
  + x64
* MacOS universal binary
  + x64
  + arm64
* Windows
  + x64

### Release Integrity

Releases are created automatically and signed using the [Node team's GPG key](https://pgp.mongodb.com/node-driver.asc). This applies to the git tag as well as all release packages provided as part of a GitHub release. To verify the provided packages, download the key and import it using gpg:

```
gpg --import node-driver.asc

```

The GitHub release contains a detached signature file for the NPM package (named
`kerberos-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig`).

The following command returns the link npm package.

```
npm view kerberos@vX.Y.Z dist.tarball
```

Using the result of the above command, a `curl` command can return the official npm package for the release.

To verify the integrity of the downloaded package, run the following command:

```
gpg --verify kerberos-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig kerberos-X.Y.Z.tgz
```

Note

No verification is done when using npm to install the package. To ensure release integrity when using npm, download the tarball manually from the GitHub release, verify the signature, then install the package from the downloaded tarball using npm install mongodb-X.Y.Z.tgz.

To verify the native `.node` packages, follow the same steps as above.

### Testing

Run the test suite using:

```
docker run -i -v PATH_TO_KERBEROS_REPO:/app -w /app -e PROJECT_DIRECTORY=/app ubuntu:20.04 /bin/bash /app/.evergreen/run-tests-ubuntu.sh
```

NOTE: The test suite requires an active kerberos deployment.

[KerberosServer](#KerberosServer)

## Functions

[checkPassword(username, password, service, [defaultRealm], [callback])](#checkPassword) ⇒ `Promise`

This function provides a simple way to verify that a user name and password
match those normally used for Kerberos authentication.
It does this by checking that the supplied user name and password can be
used to get a ticket for the supplied service.
If the user name does not contain a realm, then the default realm supplied
is used.

For this to work properly the Kerberos must be configured properly on this
machine.
That will likely mean ensuring that the edu.mit.Kerberos preference file
has the correct realms and KDCs listed.

IMPORTANT: This method is vulnerable to KDC spoofing attacks and it should
only be used for testing. Do not use this in any production system - your
security could be compromised if you do.

[principalDetails(service, hostname, [callback])](#principalDetails) ⇒ `Promise`

This function returns the service principal for the server given a service type and hostname.

Details are looked up via the `/etc/keytab` file.

[initializeClient(service, [options], [callback])](#initializeClient) ⇒ `Promise`

Initializes a context for client-side authentication with the given service principal.

[initializeServer(service, [callback])](#initializeServer) ⇒ `Promise`

Initializes a context for server-side authentication with the given service principal.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

# **TL;DR**

1. There is a need for awareness of the potential risks of using open source code
2. Introducing the *DLL preloading vulnerability* we discovered on Kerberos.
3. Mitigation & helpful tools and utilities.
4. <https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1514>
# Now it’s official

CVE-2020–13110 ! Search for it !

# Here we start

For those who are not familiar with NPM (Node Package Manager), it is a gigantic software registry that contains hundreds of thousands of open source Node.js projects in the form of packages. As a matter of fact, if a developer wanted to share their code with the world, NPM would be a good way to do it.

Open Source development brings much to the world by sharing ideas, perspectives and yes, eventually, helpful code. Unfortunately this code, in many cases, is not implemented with security in mind. Think of it like this: a machine is built to supply its clients with X, Y and Z which it does successfully, at least at the beginning. You see this machine was brought to market without ever undergoing a rigorous battery of testing under laboratory conditions. In time defects will begin to show and it may even become dangerous to its surroundings. So in addition to diminishing in reliability, it turns into a workplace liability, an accident just waiting to happen.

In general, it is not recommended to use open-source packages without fully reviewing and testing them to confirm they are flawless and well secured.

Figure 1- a concentrated gorilla

# Let’s dig in!

So let’s get our hands dirty with some hot-off-the-press findings. While conducting research for one of our clients we came across a NPM Kerberos package. In practice, Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocol that offers a stronger encryption capability than its predecessor, NTLM.

This NPM package is responsible for supporting Kerberos authentication using the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface, on cross-platform services. While reviewing the package files, we found something of particular interest: “kerberos\_sspi”. SSPI (Security Support Provider Interface) is a Win32 API component that is essential for performing security operations such as the authentication itself.

Before we dive deeper into the technical details, consider this. So far there have been 28 versions of this package. 23 of them are vulnerable. Furthermore, the package has 3 dependencies. In order to understand the rate of spread (refreshingly, we’re not talking about Covid-19), here’s a graph that represents the number of downloads each week during the last year:

![]()

Figure 2 — Number of downloads across periods of times

Our research focused on one component used inside the package file that poses a great risk to the overall security of the user: the dynamic loading of DLLs.

The method responsible for this is called “LoadLibrary()” and it has two possible implementations: the first is supplying a fully qualified path. The second is searching for a named DLL by running through a list of directories.

```
_sspi_security_dll = LoadLibrary("security.dll");if(_sspi_security_dll == NULL) {
   err = GetLastError();
   return err;
 }

 _sspi_secur32_dll = LoadLibrary("secur32.dll");if(_sspi_secur32_dll == NULL) {
   err = GetLastError();
   return err;
 }
```

The LoadLibrary() searches for the named DLL in these directories in a set order and stops when it finds the DLL it is looking for. An attacker could therefore inject a legitimately named but malicious DLL into the first directory that is searched. The “LoadLibrary()” would find this DLL and stop its search. This malicious DLL would then be loaded into memory bringing with it potential for ACE (arbitrary code execution) and privilege escalation.

# POC — Arbitrary code execution (ACE) and privilege escalation (PE)

Injecting a trojan DLL into an endpoint’s memory can lead to the execution of malicious code with unlimited possibilities on the endpoint, but arguably the most interesting is privilege escalation. Using highest privileged access, an attacker gains full control over the system and can view, edit and modify system files.

The reason ACE and PE attacks are mentioned in one breath is that when they are chained together, their effect causes a severe impact on the system. When combined, the attacker can execute code **remotely.** Thus ACE evolves into RCE (remote code execution).

Here’s how an attacker can exploit this attack:

Figure 3- Attack’s flow

# Mitigation

When using functions such as “LoadLibrary()” it is essential to provide a full path for the assembly file in order to avoid preloading. With that being said, it is essential to update the Kerberos package to the latest version (that’s true of all packages, of course) before deploying this software in your product.

Vulnerable versions: 0.0.1–0.0.24

Secured versions: 1.0.0–1.1.3

Figure 4- Drake’s recommendation

# Take away

So, now that we’re done mitigating the vulnerability described above, there are some great players out there that have proved themselves in this kind of scenario:

* **Whitesource** brings open source security and a license compliance management platform to the table that helps detect vulnerable open source libraries and offers some other great utilities. Also, from my personal experience, they are very reliable when it comes to their research results ;) .
* **Veracode** offers a great “Software Composition Analysis” solution for discovering new open source vulnerabilities along with establishing an open source catalog.
* **NPM CLI**- The command line utility of NPM offers a bunch of useful commands, one of which, “npm-audit”, is pretty relevant here. This command can scan a project, find vulnerabilities and automatically install updates to vulnerable dependencies. If that’s not enough, it can also generate a pretty good looking report!
* **SonarQube**- A great static analyzer for inspecting code quality and identifying security vulnerabilities, along with bugs and code smells, on up to 20 programming languages.

## Package

npm

kerberos
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.0

## Description

Version of `kerberos` prior to 1.0.0 are vulnerable to DLL Injection. The package loads DLLs without specifying a full path. This may allow attackers to create a file with the same name in a folder that precedes the intended file in the DLL path search. Doing so would allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the machine.

## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 1.0.0 or later.

Written by: Dan Shallom, Cyber-security expert at OP Innovate.

TL;DR

1. There is a need for awareness of the potential risks of using open-source code
2. Introducing the *DLL preloading vulnerability* we discovered on Kerberos.
3. Mitigation & helpful tools and utilities.
4. <https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1514>
5. The CVE: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13110>

For those who are not familiar with NPM (Node Package Manager), it is a gigantic software registry that contains hundreds of thousands of open source Node.js projects in the form of packages. As a matter of fact, if a developer wanted to share their code with the world, NPM would be a good way to do it.

Open Source development brings much to the world by [sharing ideas](/blog/), perspectives, and yes, eventually, helpful code. Unfortunately this code, in many cases, is not implemented with security in mind. Think of it like this: a machine is built to supply its clients with X, Y, and Z which it does successfully, at least at the beginning. You see this machine was brought to market without ever undergoing a rigorous battery of testing under laboratory conditions. In time defects will begin to show and it may even become dangerous to its surroundings. So in addition to diminishing reliability, it turns into a workplace liability, an accident just waiting to happen.

In general, it is not recommended to use open-source packages without fully reviewing and testing them to confirm they are flawless and well secured.

![Let's dig in](data:image/svg+xml...)![Let's dig in](https://op-c.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tiny-dll1-1.webp)

**Let’s dig in!**

So let’s get our hands dirty with some hot-off-the-press findings. While conducting research for one of our clients we came across an NPM Kerberos package. In practice, Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocol that offers a stronger encryption capability than its predecessor, NTLM.

This NPM package is responsible for supporting Kerberos authentication using the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface, on cross-platform services. While reviewing the package files, we found something of particular interest: “kerberos\_sspi”. SSPI (Security Support Provider Interface) is a Win32 API component that is essential for performing security operations such as the authentication itself.

Before we dive deeper into the technical details, consider this. So far there have been 28 versions of this package. 23 of them are vulnerable. Furthermore, the package has 3 dependencies. In order to understand the rate of spread (refreshingly, we’re not talking about Covid-19), here’s a graph that represents the number of downloads each week during the last year:

![Number of Kerberos Package downloads over time](data:image/svg+xml...)![Number of Kerberos Package downloads over time](https://op-c.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tiny-dll2-1.webp)

Figure 1 – Number of downloads across periods of times

Our research focused on one component used inside the package file that poses a great risk to the overall security of the user: the dynamic loading of DLLs.

The method responsible for this is called “LoadLibrary()” and it has two possible implementations: the first is supplying a fully qualified path. The second is searching for a named DLL by running through a list of directories.

The LoadLibrary() searches for the named DLL in these directories in a set order and stops when it finds the DLL it is looking for. An attacker could therefore inject a legitimately named but malicious DLL into the first directory that is searched. The “LoadLibrary()” would find this DLL and stop its search. This malicious DLL would then be loaded into memory bringing with it potential for ACE (arbitrary code execution) and privilege escalation.

POC – Arbitrary code execution (ACE) and privilege escalation (PE)

Injecting a trojan DLL into an endpoint’s memory can lead to the execution of malicious code with unlimited possibilities on the endpoint, but arguably the most interesting is privilege escalation. Using highest privileged access, an attacker gains full control over the system and can view, edit and modify system files.

The reason ACE and PE attacks are mentioned in one breath is that when they are chained together, their effect causes a severe impact on the system. When combined, the attacker can  execute code **remotely.**Thus ACE evolves into RCE (remote code execution).

Here’s how an attacker can exploit this attack:

![DLL Preloading attack](data:image/svg+xml...)![DLL Preloading attack](https://op-c.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tiny-dll3-1.webp)

**Mitigation**

When using functions such as “LoadLibrary()” it is essential to**provide a full path for the assembly file** in order to avoid preloading. With that being said, it is essential to update the Kerberos package to the latest version (that’s true of all packages, of course) before deploying this software in your product.

Vulnerable versions: 0.0.1–0.0.24

Secured versions: 1.0.0–1.1.3

![Relative Path vs. Absolute Path](data:image/svg+xml...)![Relative Path vs. Absolute Path](https://op-c.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tiny-dll4drakeee-1.webp)

**Take away**

In conclusion, it’s important to remember that open-source code is built and designed to do a job, often without security best practice in mind.  We recommend adopting a habit of manually testing any open-source code that is integrated into your solutions, for vulnerabilities it may sneak into your solution. Eye-reviewing the code is always the best solution.

# **TL;DR**

1. There is a need for awareness of the potential risks of using open source code
2. Introducing the *DLL preloading vulnerability* we discovered on Kerberos.
3. Mitigation & helpful tools and utilities.
4. <https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1514>
# Now it’s official

CVE-2020–13110 ! Search for it !

# Here we start

For those who are not familiar with NPM (Node Package Manager), it is a gigantic software registry that contains hundreds of thousands of open source Node.js projects in the form of packages. As a matter of fact, if a developer wanted to share their code with the world, NPM would be a good way to do it.

Open Source development brings much to the world by sharing ideas, perspectives and yes, eventually, helpful code. Unfortunately this code, in many cases, is not implemented with security in mind. Think of it like this: a machine is built to supply its clients with X, Y and Z which it does successfully, at least at the beginning. You see this machine was brought to market without ever undergoing a rigorous battery of testing under laboratory conditions. In time defects will begin to show and it may even become dangerous to its surroundings. So in addition to diminishing in reliability, it turns into a workplace liability, an accident just waiting to happen.

In general, it is not recommended to use open-source packages without fully reviewing and testing them to confirm they are flawless and well secured.

# Let’s dig in!

So let’s get our hands dirty with some hot-off-the-press findings. While conducting research for one of our clients we came across a NPM Kerberos package. In practice, Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocol that offers a stronger encryption capability than its predecessor, NTLM.

This NPM package is responsible for supporting Kerberos authentication using the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface, on cross-platform services. While reviewing the package files, we found something of particular interest: “kerberos\_sspi”. SSPI (Security Support Provider Interface) is a Win32 API component that is essential for performing security operations such as the authentication itself.

Before we dive deeper into the technical details, consider this. So far there have been 28 versions of this package. 23 of them are vulnerable. Furthermore, the package has 3 dependencies. In order to understand the rate of spread (refreshingly, we’re not talking about Covid-19), here’s a graph that represents the number of downloads each week during the last year:

Figure 2 — Number of downloads across periods of times

Our research focused on one component used inside the package file that poses a great risk to the overall security of the user: the dynamic loading of DLLs.

The method responsible for this is called “LoadLibrary()” and it has two possible implementations: the first is supplying a fully qualified path. The second is searching for a named DLL by running through a list of directories.

```
_sspi_security_dll = LoadLibrary("security.dll");if(_sspi_security_dll == NULL) {
   err = GetLastError();
   return err;
 }

 _sspi_secur32_dll = LoadLibrary("secur32.dll");if(_sspi_secur32_dll == NULL) {
   err = GetLastError();
   return err;
 }
```

The LoadLibrary() searches for the named DLL in these directories in a set order and stops when it finds the DLL it is looking for. An attacker could therefore inject a legitimately named but malicious DLL into the first directory that is searched. The “LoadLibrary()” would find this DLL and stop its search. This malicious DLL would then be loaded into memory bringing with it potential for ACE (arbitrary code execution) and privilege escalation.

# POC — Arbitrary code execution (ACE) and privilege escalation (PE)

Injecting a trojan DLL into an endpoint’s memory can lead to the execution of malicious code with unlimited possibilities on the endpoint, but arguably the most interesting is privilege escalation. Using highest privileged access, an attacker gains full control over the system and can view, edit and modify system files.

The reason ACE and PE attacks are mentioned in one breath is that when they are chained together, their effect causes a severe impact on the system. When combined, the attacker can execute code **remotely.** Thus ACE evolves into RCE (remote code execution).

Here’s how an attacker can exploit this attack:

# Mitigation

When using functions such as “LoadLibrary()” it is essential to provide a full path for the assembly file in order to avoid preloading. With that being said, it is essential to update the Kerberos package to the latest version (that’s true of all packages, of course) before deploying this software in your product.

Vulnerable versions: 0.0.1–0.0.24

Secured versions: 1.0.0–1.1.3

# Take away

So, now that we’re done mitigating the vulnerability described above, there are some great players out there that have proved themselves in this kind of scenario:

* **Whitesource** brings open source security and a license compliance management platform to the table that helps detect vulnerable open source libraries and offers some other great utilities. Also, from my personal experience, they are very reliable when it comes to their research results ;) .
* **Veracode** offers a great “Software Composition Analysis” solution for discovering new open source vulnerabilities along with establishing an open source catalog.
* **NPM CLI**- The command line utility of NPM offers a bunch of useful commands, one of which, “npm-audit”, is pretty relevant here. This command can scan a project, find vulnerabilities and automatically install updates to vulnerable dependencies. If that’s not enough, it can also generate a pretty good looking report!
* **SonarQube**- A great static analyzer for inspecting code quality and identifying security vulnerabilities, along with bugs and code smells, on up to 20 programming languages.
