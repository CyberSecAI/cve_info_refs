  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `kerberos` npm package on Windows loads DLLs using `LoadLibrary()` without specifying a full path, making it vulnerable to DLL injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "DLL preloading vulnerability: The `LoadLibrary()` function searches for DLLs in a set order of directories. An attacker can inject a malicious DLL with the same name into a directory that appears earlier in the search path.",
        "Missing full path specification: The vulnerable code lacks a fully qualified path to the DLLs, relying on the system's DLL search order."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution (ACE) and privilege escalation (PE). The attacker can execute malicious code, gain full control over the system, view/edit system files, and potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE).",
      "attack_vectors": "Local attack: The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the intended system directory when the vulnerable software loads. The vulnerability does not require any network interaction.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to write files to the local filesystem, in a location that takes precedence in the DLL search order, to place a malicious DLL. User interaction is required, as the victim user must execute code that uses the vulnerable library. No special privileges are required by the attacker before the attack is launched."
