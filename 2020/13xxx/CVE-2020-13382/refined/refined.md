Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:**
The provided content references several commits related to security fixes in the openSIS-Classic project. Specifically, the following vulnerabilities are mentioned in the commit messages:

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Location:** `modules/scheduling/ViewSchedule.php`
    *   **Description:**  Authenticated SQL Injection vulnerability exploitable by a low-privileged user, such as a student.

2.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Location 1:** `ForExport.php`
    *   **Description 1:** Authenticated Reflected XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Location 2:** `CheckUrlWs.php`
    *   **Description 2:** Unauthenticated Reflected XSS vulnerability.

3.  **Vulnerability in `Side.php`:**
    *   **Description:** General mention of a vulnerability fix in `Side.php`, details are not specified.

4.  **SQL Security Issue:**
   *   **Description:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command. Location is not specified.

5.  **Vulnerability in `MassScheduleModal.php`:**
    *   **Description:** General mention of a vulnerability fix in `MassScheduleModal.php`, details are not specified.

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability is likely due to unsanitized user input being directly used in SQL queries.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities are caused by the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into web pages.
* The "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command" indicates a lack of proper handling of special characters in SQL queries, leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Failure to sanitize user input before using it in database queries.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Lack of input sanitization or output encoding, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements:**  Failure to handle special characters in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or potentially compromise the entire database.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerable parameters/input fields in the `modules/scheduling/ViewSchedule.php` file.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads, which would be reflected back and executed in the victim's browser when the link is accessed in `ForExport.php` and `CheckUrlWs.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Requires a low-privileged user account (e.g., student).
    *   Requires access to the application.
*   **Authenticated XSS:**
    *   Requires an authenticated user account.
    *   Requires access to the application.
*   **Unauthenticated XSS:**
     *   Does not require prior authentication.
     *   Requires access to the application

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commits suggest a proactive approach to identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in the openSIS-Classic project.
*   The project seems to be actively maintained and updated with security patches.
*   Some commit messages are very generic and do not provide specific details.
