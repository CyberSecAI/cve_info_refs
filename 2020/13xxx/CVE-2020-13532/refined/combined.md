# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1146

## Dream Report platform privilege escalation vulnerability

##### April 8, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13532, CVE-2020-13533, CVE-2020-13534

### Summary

Multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities exist in Dream Report 5 R20-2. A specially crafted executable can cause elevated capabilities. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Dream Report 5 R20-2

### Product URLs

<https://dreamreport.net/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-276 - Incorrect Default Permissions

### Details

Dream Report 5 R20-2 is a real-time reporting and charting solution. It collects and processes real-time information from variety of systems through a number of connectors which can be used for data import.

By default, Dream Report 5 R20-2 is installed in the `C:\ODS` directory with permissions that allows anyone on the system to have “full control” over certain files in the directory. This can lead to exploitable privilege escalations which can be triggered directly or indirectly by an attacker.

#### CVE-2020-13532 - Syncfusion Dashboard Service Privilege Escalation

In the default configuration, the `Syncfusion Dashboard Service` service binary can be replaced by attackers to escalate privileges to `NT SYSTEM`:

```
cacls "C:\ODS\Dream Report\Dashboard\Dashboard Platform SDK\Utilities\Windows Service\Syncfusion Dashboard Windows Service.exe"
C:\ODS\Dream Report\Dashboard\Dashboard Platform SDK\Utilities\Windows Service\Syncfusion Dashboard Windows Service.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
																														Everyone:(ID)F

```
#### CVE-2020-13533 - ods\_rtm\_launch and ods\_usc Run Key Privilege Escalation

In the default configuration, the following registry keys, which reference binaries with weak permissions, can be abused by attackers to effectively ‘backdoor’ the installation files and escalate privileges when a new user logs in and uses the application:

```
Registry Key (x86): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_rtm_launch
Registry Key (x64): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_rtm_launch
Binary: C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\RTM.exe
Permission: cacls "C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\RTM.exe"
C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\Rtm.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
								   Everyone:(ID)F

Registry Key (x86): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_usc
Registry Key (x64): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_usc
Binary: C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\usc.exe
Permission: cacls "C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\usc.exe"
C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\USC.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
								   Everyone:(ID)F

```
#### CVE-2020-13534 - DCOM Server Application Privilege Escalation

The following COM Class Identifiers (CLSID), installed by Dream Report 5 20-2, reference LocalServer32 and InprocServer32 with weak privileges which can lead to privilege escalation when used:

```
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{CAB0B109-A3F4-44B8-AE0B-47C45DF8BCBC}\LocalServer32\LocalServer32
Binary:  C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IDSEng.exe
Permission: cacls "C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IDSEng.exe"
C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IDSEng.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
									  Everyone:(ID)F

Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{E3D65B93-2D26-41F1-B655-F14144C879B6}\InprocServer32\InprocServer32
Binary: C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IISToolbox.dll
Permission: cacls "C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IISToolbox.dll"
C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IISToolbox.dll BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
                                      Everyone:(ID)F
