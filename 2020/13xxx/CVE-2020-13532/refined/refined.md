- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions on files and registry keys during installation of Dream Report 5 R20-2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The `Syncfusion Dashboard Service` service binary located at `C:\ODS\Dream Report\Dashboard\Dashboard Platform SDK\Utilities\Windows Service\Syncfusion Dashboard Windows Service.exe` has "Full Control" permissions for "Everyone," allowing any user to replace it.
    - Registry keys `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_rtm_launch` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_rtm_launch` (for 32-bit and 64-bit systems, respectively), and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_usc` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ods_usc`, point to executable files (`C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\RTM.exe` and `C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\usc.exe`) that also have "Full Control" permissions for "Everyone."
    - DCOM server applications are registered with CLSIDs `{CAB0B109-A3F4-44B8-AE0B-47C45DF8BCBC}` and `{E3D65B93-2D26-41F1-B655-F14144C879B6}`, which use binaries `C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IDSEng.exe` and `C:\ODS\Dream Report\System\IISToolbox.dll` respectively, that have "Full Control" permissions for "Everyone".
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation to `NT SYSTEM` level. Attackers can gain full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Replacing vulnerable service binaries (`Syncfusion Dashboard Service`).
    - Modifying the vulnerable files referenced by registry keys.
    - Modifying or hijacking the DCOM server applications
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Local access to the system.
    - Ability to write files to the installation directory and modify registry keys.
