The provided content is a changelog for the `knock-knock` Craft CMS plugin.  Version 1.2.8 specifically mentions two vulnerabilities fixed: an IP whitelist bypass and an open-redirect. This relates to CVE-2020-13486.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **IP Whitelist Bypass:** The plugin was fetching the IP address of a user in a way that allowed spoofing via HTTP headers. This could allow an attacker to bypass IP-based access controls.
*   **Open-Redirect:** The plugin was not properly validating the redirect parameter after a successful login, which could allow attackers to redirect users to malicious sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insecure IP address retrieval leading to IP whitelist bypass.
*   Lack of validation of the redirect parameter, enabling open-redirect attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **IP Whitelist Bypass:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to protected resources by spoofing their IP address to appear as if they are on the whitelist.
*  **Open-Redirect:** An attacker can redirect legitimate users to a malicious site, potentially to steal credentials or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **IP Whitelist Bypass:** Attackers could manipulate HTTP headers (likely `X-Forwarded-For` or similar headers) to make their IP address appear on the whitelist.
*   **Open-Redirect:** Attackers could craft a malicious URL with a manipulated redirect parameter that points to a malicious site. This URL could be sent to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **IP Whitelist Bypass:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with forged headers to the server.
*   **Open-Redirect:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a legitimate user into clicking a crafted URL.

**Additional details from the changelog:**

*   The changelog mentions that the fix for the open-redirect vulnerability requires that custom login forms be updated to use `{{ redirect | hash }}` to ensure proper redirect validation.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Paweł Hałdrzyński.
