The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13540.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions assigned to the "WIN-911 Account Change Utility.exe" executable within the WIN-911 Enterprise Platform installation directory. The "Everyone" group has full control ("F") permissions over this file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276): The "Everyone" group has full control over the "WIN-911 Account Change Utility.exe" file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can overwrite the "WIN-911 Account Change Utility.exe" executable with malicious code. When an administrative user executes the legitimate utility, the attacker's code will run with elevated privileges, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local file system access: The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable WIN-911 software is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system with the ability to write files to the installation directory (typically located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\WIN-911 Software\ACU\").
- The attacker needs to be able to replace the original "WIN-911 Account Change Utility.exe" file with a malicious executable.
- The attack requires an administrative level user to execute the replaced utility for privilege escalation.
