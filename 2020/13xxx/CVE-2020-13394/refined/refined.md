Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Tenda router's web server (httpd).
- The vulnerability occurs when processing the `list` parameter in a POST request.
- The value of the `list` parameter is directly copied using `strcpy` to a local variable on the stack without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The use of `strcpy` without checking the length of the input (`list` parameter) allows writing beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The web server does not validate or sanitize the `list` parameter before copying it into a local variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer on the stack, attackers can overwrite the return address of the function. This allows them to redirect program execution to attacker-controlled code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) can cause a Denial of Service. This likely occurs when the overflow corrupts critical data on the stack causing the device to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to a specific endpoint on the router's web server.
- **`list` Parameter:** The malicious payload is included as the value of the `list` parameter in the POST request's body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router's web interface. This could be from within the local network or, if the web interface is exposed, from the internet.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:**  The attacker needs to know the correct request endpoint and the name of the vulnerable parameter `list`.
- **Crafted Payload:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload that, when placed in the `list` parameter, overwrites the return address and potentially includes shellcode to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** The provided example includes a `Cookie: password=qpl5gk` which indicates that authentication might be required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes specific firmware versions of Tenda routers affected by the vulnerability.
- The analysis also includes ARM and MIPS assembly code snippets demonstrating stack buffer overflow in different CPU architectures
- The provided PoC is only for demonstration purposes and may cause a denial of service
- The `strcpy` is a well-known dangerous function for buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which should be avoided.
