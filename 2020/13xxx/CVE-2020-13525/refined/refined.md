The content is related to CVE-2020-13525.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of the `sort` parameter in HTTP requests leads to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `reportTables_Ajax` page.
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `clientSetupAjax` page.
- The `sort` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database.
- This could lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or complete database compromise.
- The CVSS score indicates a moderate impact with potential for low confidentiality and integrity impact, and no impact to availability (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoints with a malicious `sort` parameter.
- The attacker must be authenticated to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be authenticated user of ProcessMaker.
- Network access to the application is required to send malicious requests.
