- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions on the installation directory and executable files of LogicalDoc, allowing authenticated users to modify them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lax permissions on the base installation directory (`C:\LogicalDOC`), granting "Authenticated Users" group "Change" privileges.
    - Lax permissions on executables like `LogicalDOC.exe` and `update-wd.exe` allowing modification by "Authenticated Users".
    - The ability to replace DLLs loaded by the vulnerable executables.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Replacing the `LogicalDOC.exe` executable.
    - Replacing the `update-wd.exe` executable.
    - Replacing DLL files loaded by the mentioned executables.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where LogicalDoc is installed.
