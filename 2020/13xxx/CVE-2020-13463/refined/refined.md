The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities discovered in various STM32F103 microcontroller clones and the original STM32F103. While the document doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2020-13463, it describes several vulnerabilities which have been assigned CVEs as shown in Table 4 of the document. The vulnerability assigned CVE-2020-13463 is related to the APM32F103 microcontroller which is discussed.

Here's a breakdown of the information related to **CVE-2020-13463**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a design flaw in the APM32F103 microcontroller that allows unauthorized access to the flash memory. Specifically, while the debug interface is blocked for data access in RDP level 1, the instruction bus remains accessible. This allows fetching of interrupt vectors from flash memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **D1-B: Extraction via Exceptions:** The CPU is able to access the flash memory through the instruction bus even when the debug interface is blocked for data read/write. The CPU fetches interrupt vectors through the instruction bus, allowing an attacker to read out the flash memory contents in the vector table by deliberately generating exceptions via the debug interface and observing the loaded vector address. The vector table can be relocated with VTOR, and combined with the wrap-around behavior of external interrupts, this permits significant data extraction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract up to 93.8% of the flash memory contents, including the user's firmware, by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves using the debug interface to trigger exceptions.
- The attacker needs to set the device to RDP level 1 to expose the vulnerability.
- The attacker then triggers exceptions to cause the CPU to fetch interrupt vectors from flash, allowing the addresses to be read through the debugger.
- The VTOR is used to relocate the vector table to read more of flash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker requires physical access to the device.
- An attacker needs a debugger to connect to the device.
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger exceptions using the debug interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to read CPU registers through the debugger, including the program counter.
