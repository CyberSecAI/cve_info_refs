Package        : velocity-tools
Version        : 2.0-6+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-13959
Debian Bug     : #985221

It was discovered that there was a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability in velocity-tools, a collection of useful tools for the
"Velocity" template engine.

The default error page could be exploited to steal session cookies,
perform requests in the name of the victim, used for phishing attacks
and many other similar attacks.

For Debian 9 "Stretch", this problem has been fixed in version
2.0-6+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your velocity-tools packages.

For the detailed security status of velocity-tools please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/velocity-tools>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Subject: CVE-2020-13959: Velocity Tools XSS Vulnerability

Description:

The default error page for VelocityView reflects back the vm file that
was entered as part of the URL.  An attacker can set an XSS payload
file as this vm file in the URL which results in this payload being
executed.

XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in
the context of the attacked website and the attacked user. This can be
abused to steal session cookies, perform requests in the name of the
victim or for phishing attacks.

Mitigation:

Applications based on Apache Velocity Tools should upgrade to version
3.1.  This version escapes the reflected text on the default error
page, preventing potential javascript execution.

Credit:

This issue was reported and a patch was submitted by Jackson Henry,
member of Sakura Samurai.

| [Description](#c0)  Jean-Fran√ßois Brunette (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-11 07:57:44 UTC  ``` mailman vulnerabilities CAN-2004-1177, <http://bugs.debian.org/285839>   Details follow:  Florian Weimer discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in mailman's automatically generated error messages. An attacker could craft an URL containing JavaScript (or other content embedded into HTML) which triggered a mailman error page. When an unsuspecting user followed this URL, the malicious content was copied unmodified to the error page and executed in the context of this page.   Important note:  There is currently another known vulnerability: when an user subscribes to a mailing list without choosing a password, mailman automatically generates one. However, there are only about 5 million different possible passwords which allows brute force attacks.  A different password generation algorithm already exists, but is currently too immature to be put into a stable release security update. Therefore it is advisable to always explicitly choose a password for subscriptions ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-11 07:58:46 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 74459](show_bug.cgi?id=74459 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - net-mail/mailman Weak auto-generated passwords (CAN-2004-1143) (Vendor-Sec)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tuan Van (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-11 09:25:13 UTC  ``` our mailman doesn't have 55_options_traceback.dpatch apply. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-13 09:56:19 UTC  ``` The mentioned 55_options_traceback.dpatch in the debian bug report appears unrelated to the reported issue. Updated URI with Ubuntu bug report. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-13 22:15:51 UTC  ``` Upstream fix is located here:  <http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/mailman/mailman/scripts/driver?r1=2.6.2.1&r2=2.6.2.2&only_with_tag=Release_2_1-maint>  And ChangeLog says: Close a potential cross-site scripting hole, discovered by Florian Weimer. Initial patch provided by Florian, modified by Barry.  Also, turn STEALTH_MODE on by default.  Most sites won't change this value from its default, so we might as well use the more secure option.  Also, if STEALTH_MODE is turned off, but the websafe() function can't be imported, turn STEALTH_MODE back on. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-15 13:12:07 UTC  ``` net-mail herd: please check and apply patch from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=77524#c4). ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tuan Van (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-15 19:22:38 UTC  ``` ebuild with patch commited. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-16 05:10:30 UTC  ``` Thx Tuan.  Arches please mark mailman-2.1.5-r3 stable. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-16 13:04:01 UTC  ``` sparc'd ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Tuan Van (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-16 21:27:55 UTC  ``` x86 done. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-19 01:47:27 UTC  ``` I would say this needs a GLSA, because list administration apps are quite accessible and make worthy targets. Furthermore we can do the same as Ubuntu and issue a small warning about the relative autopassword weakness issue (even if it's not worth a vulnerability by itself). ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-19 01:56:56 UTC  ``` I vote for GLSA on this one too, Mailman is pretty widespread. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Karol Wojtaszek (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-19 12:57:41 UTC  ``` Stable on amd64 ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Luke Macken (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-21 16:04:36 UTC  ``` GLSA 200501-29 ``` |  |
