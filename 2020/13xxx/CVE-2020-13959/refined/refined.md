Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the default error page of Apache Velocity Tools. This page reflects back the VM file specified in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input (the VM file name in the URL) is not properly sanitized or escaped before being included in the error page HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a URL that specifies an XSS payload as the VM file.
*   When a user visits this crafted URL, the injected JavaScript executes within the user's browser, in the context of the vulnerable website.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   Performing actions on the user's behalf (e.g., making requests to the server).
    *   Phishing attacks (displaying fake login prompts).
    *   Other malicious activities within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes an XSS payload as part of the VM filename.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to be tricked into clicking the malicious URL or visiting a page that contains the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and distribute them to victims.
*   No direct access to the server is required; the vulnerability is exploited through user interaction with a specifically crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix was to escape the reflected text on the default error page, preventing javascript execution
*   The affected version of `velocity-tools` in Debian 9 "Stretch" was 2.0-6, and the fix was provided in version 2.0-6+deb9u1.
*   Apache Velocity users should upgrade to version 2.3 or higher.
