{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `failure_message` of build dependencies was not sanitized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can perform arbitrary actions on behalf of victims at the client side.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious dependency name in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, an attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the job details.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in a project where they have write access."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "exploit_details": "The vulnerability can be exploited by including an `<iframe>` tag with a `srcdoc` attribute containing a malicious `<script>` tag in the dependency name. This allows the XSS to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) mitigations.",
    "affected_configurations": "Self-managed GitLab installations are affected, as the dependency validation is enabled by default, while gitlab.com has this feature disabled.",
     "remediation": "The `failure_message` should be sanitized to prevent execution of arbitrary code."
