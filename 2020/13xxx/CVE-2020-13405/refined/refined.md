      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a debugging script (`controller.php`) that was left in the production code of MicroWeber's users module. This script directly outputs all user data from the database when accessed.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Information disclosure",
          "Lack of authentication/authorization"
        ],
        "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the entire user database, including admin password hashes and emails.",
        "attack_vectors": "By submitting a POST request to the `/modules/` endpoint with the `module` parameter set to `/modules/users/controller`",
        "required_capabilities": "No authentication required. An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable instance."
      },
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the `controller.php` script, which contained the PHP code `dd(User::all());`. This uses Laravel's dump and die function to output all user data to the browser. The vulnerability is triggered by a POST request to `/modules/` with the parameter `module=/modules/users/controller` and no authentication is required.  The user database includes admin user information which could be used to compromise the system if the passwords are weak and cracked.  The vulnerability was fixed by removing the `controller.php` file from the codebase. By default, MicroWeber uses bcrypt for password hashing. The hashes are crackable with Hashcat."
