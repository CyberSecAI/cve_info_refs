## NanoHTTPD – a tiny web server in Java

*NanoHTTPD* is a light-weight HTTP server designed for embedding in other applications, released under a Modified BSD licence.

It is being developed at Github and uses Apache Maven for builds & unit testing:

* Build status: [![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c080f36f54c2889e191f3f9615583fe3359efa584b25b41515389fdc399d4d5b/68747470733a2f2f6170692e7472617669732d63692e6f72672f4e616e6f48747470642f6e616e6f68747470642e706e67)](https://travis-ci.org/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd)

## Quickstart

We'll create a custom HTTP server project using Maven for build/dep system. This tutorial assumes you are using a Unix variant and a shell. First, install Maven and Java SDK if not already installed. Then run:

```
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -pl webserver -Dexec.mainClass="org.nanohttpd.webserver.SimpleWebServer"

```

You should now have a HTTP file server running on <http://localhost:8080/>.

### Custom web app

Let's raise the bar and build a custom web application next:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=myHellopApp -DinteractiveMode=false
cd myHellopApp

```

Edit `pom.xml`, and add this between <dependencies>:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
	<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
	<version>2.2.0</version>
</dependency>

```

Edit `src/main/java/com/example/App.java` and replace it with:

```
    package com.example;

    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Map;

    import fi.iki.elonen.NanoHTTPD;
    // NOTE: If you're using NanoHTTPD >= 3.0.0 the namespace is different,
    //       instead of the above import use the following:
	// import org.nanohttpd.NanoHTTPD;

    public class App extends NanoHTTPD {

        public App() throws IOException {
            super(8080);
            start(NanoHTTPD.SOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT, false);
            System.out.println("\nRunning! Point your browsers to http://localhost:8080/ \n");
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                new App();
            } catch (IOException ioe) {
                System.err.println("Couldn't start server:\n" + ioe);
            }
        }

        @Override
        public Response serve(IHTTPSession session) {
            String msg = "<html><body><h1>Hello server</h1>\n";
            Map<String, String> parms = session.getParms();
            if (parms.get("username") == null) {
                msg += "<form action='?' method='get'>\n  <p>Your name: <input type='text' name='username'></p>\n" + "</form>\n";
            } else {
                msg += "<p>Hello, " + parms.get("username") + "!</p>";
            }
            return newFixedLengthResponse(msg + "</body></html>\n");
        }
    }
```

Compile and run the server:

```
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.App"

```

If it started ok, point your browser at <http://localhost:8080/> and enjoy a web server that asks your name and replies with a greeting.

### Nanolets

Nanolets are like servlets only that they have a extremely low profile. They offer an easy to use system for a more complex server application.
This text has to be extended with an example, so for now take a look at the unit tests for the usage. <https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd/blob/master/nanolets/src/test/java/org/nanohttpd/junit/router/AppNanolets.java>

## Status

We are currently in the process of stabilizing NanoHTTPD from the many pull requests and feature requests that were integrated over the last few months. The next release will come soon, and there will not be any more "intended" major changes before the next release. If you want to use the bleeding edge version, you can clone it from Github, or get it from sonatype.org (see "Maven dependencies / Living on the edge" below).

## Project structure

NanoHTTPD project currently consist of four parts:

* `/core` – Fully functional HTTP(s) server consisting of one (1) Java file, ready to be customized/inherited for your own project.
* `/samples` – Simple examples on how to customize NanoHTTPD. See *HelloServer.java* for a killer app that greets you enthusiastically!
* `/websocket` – Websocket implementation, also in a single Java file. Depends on core.
* `/webserver` – Standalone file server. Run & enjoy. A popular use seems to be serving files out off an Android device.
* `/nanolets` – Standalone nano app server, giving a servlet like system to the implementor.
* `/fileupload` – integration of the apache common file upload library.

## Features

### Core

* Only one Java file, providing HTTP 1.1 support.
* No fixed config files, logging, authorization etc. (Implement by yourself if you need them. Errors are passed to java.util.logging, though.)
* Support for HTTPS (SSL).
* Basic support for cookies.
* Supports parameter parsing of GET and POST methods.
* Some built-in support for HEAD, POST and DELETE requests. You can easily implement/customize any HTTP method, though.
* Supports file upload. Uses memory for small uploads, temp files for large ones.
* Never caches anything.
* Does not limit bandwidth, request time or simultaneous connections by default.
* All header names are converted to lower case so they don't vary between browsers/clients.
* Persistent connections (Connection "keep-alive") support allowing multiple requests to be served over a single socket connection.

### Websocket

* Tested on Firefox, Chrome and IE.

### Webserver

* Default code serves files and shows (prints on console) all HTTP parameters and headers.
* Supports both dynamic content and file serving.
* File server supports directory listing, `index.html` and `index.htm`.
* File server supports partial content (streaming & continue download).
* File server supports ETags.
* File server does the 301 redirection trick for directories without `/`.
* File server serves also very long files without memory overhead.
* Contains a built-in list of most common MIME types.
* Runtime extension support (extensions that serve particular MIME types) - example extension that serves Markdown formatted files. Simply including an extension JAR in the webserver classpath is enough for the extension to be loaded.
* Simple [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) support via `--cors` parameter
  + by default serves `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: origin,accept,content-type`
  + possibility to set `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` by setting System property: `AccessControlAllowHeader`
  + \_example: \_ `-DAccessControlAllowHeader=origin,accept,content-type,Authorization`
  + possible values:
    - `--cors`: activates CORS support, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` will be set to `*`.
    - `--cors=some_value`: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` will be set to `some_value`.

***CORS argument examples***

* `--cors=http://appOne.company.com`
* `--cors="http://appOne.company.com, http://appTwo.company.com"`: note the double quotes so that the two URLs are considered part of a single argument.

## Maven dependencies

NanoHTTPD is a Maven based project and deployed to central. Most development environments have means to access the central repository. The coordinates to use in Maven are:

```
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
		<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
		<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>

```

(Replace `CURRENT_VERSION` with whatever is reported latest at <http://nanohttpd.org/>.)

The coordinates for your development environment should correspond to these. When looking for an older version take care because we switched groupId from *com.nanohttpd* to *org.nanohttpd* in mid 2015.

Next it depends what you are using NanoHTTPD for, there are three main usages.

## Gradle dependencies

In gradle you can use NanoHTTPD the same way because gradle accesses the same central repository:

```
dependencies {
	runtime(
		[group: 'org.nanohttpd', name: 'nanohttpd', version: 'CURRENT_VERSION'],
	)
}

```

(Replace `CURRENT_VERSION` with whatever is reported latest at <http://nanohttpd.org/>.)

Just replace the name with the artifact id of the module you want to use and gradle will find it for you.

### Develop your own specialized HTTP service

For a specialized HTTP (HTTPS) service you can use the module with artifactId *nanohttpd*.

```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
		<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
		<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
	</dependency>

```

Here you write your own subclass of *org.nanohttpd.NanoHTTPD* to configure and to serve the requests.

### Develop a websocket based service

For a specialized websocket service you can use the module with artifactId *nanohttpd-websocket*.

```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId> <!-- <groupId>com.nanohttpd</groupId> for 2.1.0 and earlier -->
		<artifactId>nanohttpd-websocket</artifactId>
		<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
	</dependency>

```

Here you write your own subclass of *org.nanohttpd.NanoWebSocketServer* to configure and to serve the websocket requests. A small standard echo example is included as *org.nanohttpd.samples.echo.DebugWebSocketServer*. You can use it as a starting point to implement your own services.

### Develop a custom HTTP file server

For a more classic approach, perhaps to just create a HTTP server serving mostly service files from your disk, you can use the module with artifactId *nanohttpd-webserver*.

```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId>
		<artifactId>nanohttpd-webserver</artifactId>
		<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
	</dependency>

```

The included class *org.nanohttpd.SimpleWebServer* is intended to be used as a starting point for your own implementation but it also can be used as is. Starting the class as is will start a HTTP server on port 8080 and publishing the current directory.

### Living on the edge

The latest Github master version can be fetched through sonatype.org:

```
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<artifactId>nanohttpd</artifactId>
		<groupId>org.nanohttpd</groupId>
		<version>XXXXX-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
...
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>sonatype-snapshots</id>
		<url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
		<snapshots>
			<enabled>true</enabled>
		</snapshots>
	</repository>
</repositories>

```

### generating an self signed SSL certificate

Just a hint how to generate a certificate for localhost.

```
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 360 -keysize 2048 -ext SAN=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1  -validity 9999

```

This will generate a keystore file named 'keystore.jks' with a self signed certificate for a host named localhost with the IP address 127.0.0.1 . Now
you can use:

```
server.makeSecure(NanoHTTPD.makeSSLSocketFactory("/keystore.jks", "password".toCharArray()), null);

```

Before you start the server to make NanoHTTPD serve HTTPS connections, when you make sure 'keystore.jks' is in your classpath.

## Early Detection and Quick Remediation

Easily identify, prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities in your open source packages and binaries by performing continuous scanning of repositories, build packages, and container images throughout the development cycle. Discover security threats early to reduce risk, speed up fixes and save costs

![](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07153605/Graphic.png)

## Developer Productivity and Experience

Seamlessly integrate with developer tools, enabling efficient and automated protection of code with minimal impact on build times. View vulnerable dependencies with remediation options and context directly in your IDE/CLI. Automate your pipeline with JFrog’s CLI tool for dependency, container and on-demand scans.

![](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07153648/Graphic-2.png)

## License Compliance at Scale

Get full visibility into direct and indirect dependencies with automatically-generated software bill of materials (SBOMs). Detect and resolve open source licensing issues before they manifest in production, and easily create policies to enforce regulations and generate compliance reports of all your OSS licenses.

![](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07153722/Graphic-3.png)

## Operational Risk Management

Access additional data on OSS components to evaluate operational risk. Create custom policies to block packages based on risk factors such as version age, number of contributors, maintenance cadence, number of commits, and end-of-life.

![](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07153805/Graphic-4.svg)

## CVE Research and Enrichment by JFrog Security Research Team

Proactively drive security posture with in-depth CVE findings and vulnerability data from JFrog's dedicated Security Research Team. Gain a better understanding of the actual risk, prioritize high-profile CVEs, and accelerate remediation with effective resource allocation.

“Most large companies have multiple sites and it is critical for those companies to manage authentication and permission efficiently across locations. JFrog Enterprise+ will provide us with an ideal setup that will allow us to meet our rigorous requirements from the get go. It's advanced capabilities, like Access Federation, will reduce our overhead by keeping the users, permissions, and and groups in-sync between sites.”
Siva Mandadi
DevOps - Autonomous Driving, Mercedes

“JFrog Enterprise+ increases developer productivity and eliminates frustration. JFrog Distribution is basically a CDN On-Prem that enables us to distribute software to remote locations in a reliable way. Whereas, JFrog Access Federation gives us the ability to share credentials, access and group memebers across different locations with ease.”

 Align Technology

"Instead of a 15-month cycle, today we can release virtually on request.”
Martin Eggenberger
Chief Architect,
Monster

“As a long-time DevOps engineer, I know how difficult it can be to keep track of the myriad of package types – legacy and new – that corporations have in their inventory. JFrog has always done a phenomenal job at keeping our team supported, efficient and operational – because if JFrog goes out, we might as well go home. Thankfully, with AWS infrastructure at our backs as well, we know we can develop and deliver with confidence anywhere our business demands today, and in the future.”
Joel Vasallo
Head of Cloud DevOps,
Redbox

“The capabilities of Artifactory are what allow us to do what we can do today…With Xray, [security] is a no-brainer – it’s built in, just turn it on, wow! I’ll take that all day long.”
Larry Grill,
DevSecOps Sr. Manager,
Hitachi Vantara

“When we had that issue with log4j, it was announced on Friday afternoon and [using JFrog] by Monday at noon we had all cities rolled out with the patch.”
Hanno Walischewski
Chief System Architect,
Yunex Traffic

“Among the lessons we learned from this compromise is, in general, you should arrange your system so you never build directly from the internet without any intervening scanning tool in place to validate the dependencies you bring into your builds. To this end, we use an instance of JFrog® Artifactory®, not the cloud service, to host our dependencies, which is the only valid source for any software artifacts bound for staging, production, or on-premises releases.”

"Since moving to Artifactory, our team has been able to cut down our maintenance burden significantly…we’re able to move on and be a more in depth DevOps organization."
Stefan Krause
Software Engineer,
Workiva

“Over 300,000 users around the world rely on PRTG to monitor vital parts of their different-sized networks. Therefore, it is our obligation to develop and enhance not only our software itself but also the security and release processes around it. JFrog helps us do this in the most efficient manner.”
Konstantin Wolff
Infrastructure Engineer,
Paessler AG

“JFrog Connect, for me, is really a scaling tool so I can deploy edge IoT integrations much quicker and manage them at a larger scale. There’s less manual, one-off intervention when connecting to different customer sites with different VPNs and firewall requirements.”
Ben Fussell
Systems Integration Engineer,
Ndustrial

"We wanted to figure out what can we really use instead of having five, six different applications. Maintaining them. Is there anything we can use as a single solution? And Artifactory came to the rescue. It really turned out to be a one-stop shop for us. It really provided everything that we need."

“Most large companies have multiple sites and it is critical for those companies to manage authentication and permission efficiently across locations. JFrog Enterprise+ will provide us with an ideal setup that will allow us to meet our rigorous requirements from the get go. It's advanced capabilities, like Access Federation, will reduce our overhead by keeping the users, permissions, and and groups in-sync between sites.”

“JFrog Enterprise+ increases developer productivity and eliminates frustration. JFrog Distribution is basically a CDN On-Prem that enables us to distribute software to remote locations in a reliable way. Whereas, JFrog Access Federation gives us the ability to share credentials, access and group memebers across different locations with ease.”

“As a long-time DevOps engineer, I know how difficult it can be to keep track of the myriad of package types – legacy and new – that corporations have in their inventory. JFrog has always done a phenomenal job at keeping our team supported, efficient and operational – because if JFrog goes out, we might as well go home. Thankfully, with AWS infrastructure at our backs as well, we know we can develop and deliver with confidence anywhere our business demands today, and in the future.”
Joel Vasallo
Head of Cloud DevOps,

“The capabilities of Artifactory are what allow us to do what we can do today…With Xray, [security] is a no-brainer – it’s built in, just turn it on, wow! I’ll take that all day long.”

“When we had that issue with log4j, it was announced on Friday afternoon and [using JFrog] by Monday at noon we had all cities rolled out with the patch.”

“Among the lessons we learned from this compromise is, in general, you should arrange your system so you never build directly from the internet without any intervening scanning tool in place to validate the dependencies you bring into your builds. To this end, we use an instance of JFrog® Artifactory®, not the cloud service, to host our dependencies, which is the only valid source for any software artifacts bound for staging, production, or on-premises releases.”
