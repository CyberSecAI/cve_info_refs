Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Stashcat web application stores sensitive information, including session credentials (client key and device ID), the private key for end-to-end encryption, the salt value for crypto functions, the user's email address, and complete user information, in cleartext within the browser's local storage. This storage is persistent and occurs without any user interaction or explicit consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The core vulnerability is the storage of sensitive data, including authentication credentials and cryptographic keys, in an unencrypted format.
-   Lack of user opt-in/opt-out for persistent storage: The application does not provide any mechanism for users to choose whether or not to have this data stored persistently, nor does it inform users of the associated security risks.
-   Insufficient session management:  Session data is not deleted client-side when it expires on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Full Account Access:** An attacker who gains access to the local storage database file can obtain complete and unlimited access to the victim's Stashcat account without needing the user's password.
-   **Access to Encrypted Communication:** Because the private key for end-to-end encryption is stored in cleartext, attackers can decrypt all end-to-end encrypted messages.
-   **Information Disclosure:** Besides messages, the attacker gains access to all files, user data and metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local File Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining access to the user's local storage database file on their device (e.g., `webappsstore SQLITE database` in Firefox, or the respective `.ldb` file and database log file in Chromium).
-   **Physical Access:** If an attacker has physical access to the user's device, they can easily retrieve the data from the local storage.
-   **Malware/Compromised System:** Malware or an already compromised system could be used to steal the local storage data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to obtain a copy of the browser's local storage database file of the victim. This can be done through:
    -   Local access to the victim's device.
    -   Malware infection.
    -   Compromise of the user's system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in versions of Stashcat up to and including 3.9.2.
- The vendor published a fix in version 3.10.0, introducing a checkbox for users to choose between local or session storage for their session ID.
- The described situation violates basic rules of BSI Grundschutz for secure web applications.
- The vendor's initial response was considered inadequate due to a lack of sufficient understanding of possible attack vectors.
