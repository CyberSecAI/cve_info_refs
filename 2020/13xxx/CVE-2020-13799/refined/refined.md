## Analysis of CVE-2020-13799

The provided documents discuss a replay attack vulnerability in the Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) protocol.

**Root Cause:** The RPMB protocol, used in storage devices like eMMC, UFS, and NVMe, does not adequately ensure the freshness of write requests and responses. This allows an attacker to replay stale messages.

**Vulnerability:**
*   Lack of sufficient protection against replay attacks in the RPMB protocol.
*   Specifically, the protocol doesn't prevent the replay of stale write failure messages and write commands.

**Impact:**

*   An attacker with physical access can cause a mismatch between the write state or contents of the RPMB area and a trusted component of the device.
*   This can lead to a trusted component believing a write command failed when it succeeded, or believing that certain content was written when different content was actually written.
*   The specific implications depend on the device and the use of RPMB, but can lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Physical access to the device is required.
*   The attacker needs the ability to interfere with, prevent, or replay the execution of RPMB commands.
*   Architectures that rely on an untrusted operating system to execute RPMB operations on behalf of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) are particularly vulnerable.

**Affected Devices:** Mobile phones and tablets using flash storage technology such as eMMC, UFS, and NVMe.

**Affected Vendors:** Google, Intel, MediaTek, Samsung Mobile, Nvidia.

**Mitigation:** Updates should be provided by vendors of host systems that rely on the RPMB feature. Affected product vendors should contact their host processor or TEE software provider for remediation details.
