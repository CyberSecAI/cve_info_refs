## Replay Attack Vulnerabilities in RPMB Protocol Applications

---

**WDC Tracking Number:** WDC-20008

**Published:** November 10, 2020

**Last Updated:**  November 10, 2020

#### Description

Western Digital has identified a security vulnerability in the Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) protocol as specified in multiple standards for storage device interfaces, including eMMC, UFS, and NVMe. The RPMB protocol is specified by industry standards bodies and is implemented by storage devices from multiple vendors to assist host systems in securing trusted firmware. Several scenarios have been identified in which the RPMB state may be affected by an attacker without the knowledge of the trusted component that uses the RPMB feature.

The RPMB feature is frequently used in embedded systems such as phones and tablets as part of their overall security architecture. The impact of these vulnerabilities will depend on how hosts use the RPMB feature, and affected hosts may address these vulnerabilities by incorporating specific mitigations into their initialization and error-handling routines. Western Digital has provided details of the vulnerability to multiple vendors of host processors and software solutions and is publishing this bulletin as part of an industry-wide coordinated vulnerability disclosure process to promote security in embedded storage applications.

#### Update Availability/Remediation

Updates should be provided by vendors of host systems which rely on the RPMB feature as part of their security architecture. Affected product vendors should reach out to the provider of their host processor or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) software for details on remediation status. Where available, we have listed the status from specific vendors below.

**Intel**

Intel has assigned [CVE-2020-12355](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12355) for this vulnerability, and details will be made available in advisory [INTEL-SA-00391.](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00391.html)

**Google**

Google has assigned CVE-2020-0436 for this vulnerability.

**MediaTek**

For TEE solutions on MediaTek chipsets, please contact MediaTek directly for additional information and remediation steps.

**Samsung Mobile**

Samsung has assigned [CVE-2020-35551](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35551) for this vulnerability, and details will be made available in advisory [https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb.](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb)

**Nvidia**

Nvidia has assigned [CVE-2021-1067](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-1067) for this vulnerability, and details will be made available in advisory <https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5148>

#### Advisory Summary

The RPMB protocol fails to ensure freshness of write requests and responses. Architectures that rely on the RPMB to prevent less-trusted components or physical attackers from mutating the state of the RPMB may be vulnerable to attack through one or more scenarios. This includes, but is not limited to, architectures that specifically grant an untrusted component the ability to interfere with, prevent, or replay the execution of RPMB commands, such as architectures that rely on an untrusted operating system to execute RPMB operations on behalf of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Additionally, architectures that rely on the Secure Write Protect Configuration feature present in some devices may also be vulnerable to attack through a failure to open or close write-protected regions when intended by the host. Details of these scenarios and suggested mitigations are available in a [whitepaper](https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/collateral/white-paper/white-paper-replay-protected-memory-block-protocol-vulernabilities.pdf) from Western Digital.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2020-13799](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13799)

## Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) protocol does not adequately defend against replay attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#231329

Original Release Date: 2020-11-10 | Last Revised: 2020-11-16

---

### Overview

The Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) protocol found in several storage specifications does not securely protect against replay attacks. An attacker with physical access can deceive a trusted component about the status of an RPBM write command or the content of an RPMB area.

### Description

The [RPMB](https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/collateral/white-paper/white-paper-emmc-security.pdf) protocol "...enables a device to store data in a small, specific area that is authenticated and protected against replay attack." RPMB is most commonly found in mobile phones and tablets using flash storage technology such as eMMC, UFS, and NVMe. The RPMB protocol allows an attacker to replay stale write failure messages and write commands, leading to state confusion between a trusted component and the contents of an RPMB area. Additional details are available in [Replay Attack Vulnerabilities in RPMB Protocol Applications](https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-20008-replay-attack-vulnerabilities-rpmb-protocol-applications).

### Impact

An attacker with physical access to a device can cause a mismatch between the write state or contents of the RPMB area and a trusted component of the device. These mismatches can lead to the trusted component believing a write command failed when in fact it succeeded, or the trusted component believing that certain content was written when in fact different content (unmodified by the attacker) was written. Further implications depend on the specific device and use of RPMB. At least one affected vendor has confirmed that denial of service

### Solution

Please see the Vendor Information section below. Further vendor information is available in [Replay Attack Vulnerabilities in RPMB Protocol Applications](https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-20008-replay-attack-vulnerabilities-rpmb-protocol-applications).
