{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Various hardware design and implementation flaws in the microcontrollers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "**Debug Interface Vulnerabilities:**",
    "  - Direct debug access to flash memory not blocked in RDP level 1 on some devices.",
    "  - Load instructions not sufficiently blocked when a debugger is present, allowing flash memory readout.",
    "  - Instruction bus access to flash memory not blocked, enabling readout via interrupt vector fetches.",
    "  - Control flow redirection via VTOR manipulation.",
    "  - DMA access to flash memory not properly restricted when a debugger is attached.",
    "**Invasive Hardware Attacks:**",
    "  - Eavesdropping on inter-die communication via bonding wires.",
     "  - Active manipulation of QSPI communication to downgrade RDP level.",
    "**Power Glitching:**",
    "  - Supply voltage glitch combined with FPB manipulation allows privileged shellcode execution.",
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Complete extraction of firmware from the microcontrollers, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data, intellectual property, and potential system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Debug interface (JTAG/SWD).",
    "Physical access to the microcontroller for invasive attacks.",
    "Controlled power supply for glitching attacks."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Basic hardware skills and tools for debug interface exploitation.",
     "More advanced hardware skills, tools, and chemicals for invasive attacks (decapping, wire probing/soldering).",
    "A controlled power supply and timing device for power glitch attacks."
