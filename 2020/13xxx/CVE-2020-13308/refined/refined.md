{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the way GitLab handles 2FA inheritance and user removal from projects. When a user is added to a project that inherits 2FA requirements from a parent group, they are forced to set up 2FA to access the project. However, if the user does not have 2FA enabled and they are only a member of the project (and not the parent group) they cannot remove themselves from the project, as they are not considered members of the parent group, nor can they remove themselves from the project.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the inconsistent application of membership controls. Specifically, a user added to a project cannot remove themselves or bypass the inherited 2FA requirement even if they are not a member of the group enforcing it and when removed by project owner",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user can block other users' access to GitLab by adding them to a project that inherits 2FA enforcement. Once added, the victim user is redirected to the 2FA page without the ability to remove themselves from the project or bypass the 2FA requirement. This effectively locks the user out of all resources on GitLab.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious user with the ability to add other users to a project. The malicious user adds a target user to a project that has inherited a 2FA requirement from a parent group. ",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have permissions to add users to a project within GitLab and the targeted project should inherit a 2FA requirement from parent groups. The targeted user does not require 2FA enabled."
