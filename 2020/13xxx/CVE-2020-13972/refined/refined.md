Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a chained attack combining a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Enghouse/Zeacom web chat application. The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied `WebServiceLocation` parameter. This parameter is used to specify the URL from which the application fetches data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The application allows the attacker to specify an arbitrary URL through the `WebServiceLocation` parameter, causing the server to make a request to the attacker controlled URL. This is based on previously identified vulnerabilities CVE-2019-16948 / CVE-2019-16951.
2.  **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application displays the raw response from the attacker-controlled server within the client side. This includes the execution of any JavaScript returned from that server, allowing for XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the web chat application, potentially allowing the attacker to:
*   Steal user session cookies
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user
*   Redirect users to malicious websites
*   Modify the content displayed to the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the `WebServiceLocation` parameter, which can be modified via a POST request.
*   The attacker needs to host a malicious server that responds with a XSS payload at a URL they control and then specify that URL in the vulnerable `WebServiceLocation` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the Enghouse/Zeacom web chat application.
*   The attacker needs to have control over a web server capable of responding with a crafted XSS payload.
*   The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or access within the web chat application itself, just the ability to send requests with the manipulated parameter.
