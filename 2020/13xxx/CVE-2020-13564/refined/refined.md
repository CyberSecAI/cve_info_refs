Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13564:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input within the phpGACL templating system. Specifically, the `acl_id` GET parameter is directly passed to the Smarty templating engine without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript into the `acl_id` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a vulnerable page. This vulnerability is present due to a lack of output encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can have several impacts:
    - **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.
    - **Data Theft:** Sensitive data from the page could be extracted and sent to the attacker.
    - **Malware Delivery:** Malicious scripts could be injected to redirect the user to malicious websites or force them to download malware.
    - **Page Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the page.
    - **Phishing:** Fake login forms could be injected to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the `acl_id` parameter with injected JavaScript code and tricks a user into clicking the link. The vulnerability is triggered when the victim accesses the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript code.
-   **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted URL to the victim and the victim needs to click on the malicious link.

**Specifics to CVE-2020-13564:**

-   The vulnerability specifically exists in the `admin/acl_admin.php` file.
-   The `acl_id` parameter is used to populate HTML links and a hidden form field within the `phpgacl/acl_admin.tpl` template. Since it's not sanitized, it's rendered verbatim, creating the vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability can be triggered when no `action` parameter is specified or when an invalid action is supplied via POST.
- The exploit proof of concept demonstrates how a crafted URL including `<script>alert(1)</script>` as value of `acl_id` triggers an alert box.
