The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13392.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Tenda router's web server (httpd).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `funcpara1` parameter in a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` call, without proper bounds checking, to a local variable on the stack.
- This can overwrite the function's return address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can construct a malicious payload to achieve arbitrary code execution on the device.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) can result in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted POST request to the router's web server is required.
- The `funcpara1` parameter is used to inject the overflow payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected Tenda router.
- The attacker needs to know the correct URL and the format of the POST parameters.
- The attacker must have network access to the device.
