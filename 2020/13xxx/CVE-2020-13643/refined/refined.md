Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13643:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of nonce verification in the `post_metadata` function when rendering content in the live editor. This allows an attacker to forge requests that appear to come from a legitimate user.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of nonce protection. This allows attackers to make unauthorized requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** When combined with the CSRF flaw, malicious JavaScript code could be injected via widgets such as the "Custom HTML" widget or the "Text" widget, as their data would be rendered in the live preview.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Browser:** An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code within the administrator's browser.
    *   **Site Takeover:** The vulnerability could lead to full site takeover through actions such as creating a new admin account, redirecting users, or injecting backdoors.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is to trick a site administrator into accessing a malicious link or attachment, leading to the execution of a crafted request.
    *   The attacker would need to craft a link that, when accessed by an administrator, would trigger the vulnerable function with malicious payload using the `live_editor_panels_data` POST parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs no prior authentication but needs to trick an administrator into clicking a crafted link.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a crafted request containing malicious Javascript payload and induce an administrator to trigger that request.

**Technical Details**

*   The plugin's `is_live_editor()` function checks for the `siteorigin_panels_live_editor` GET parameter to determine if the user is in the live editor mode.
*   The `live_editor_panels_data` POST parameter contains the content changes made in the live editor.
*   The `live-editor-preview.php` file renders the content provided in the `live_editor_panels_data` parameter without nonce validation.
*   The `post_metadata` function lacks nonce validation which makes it possible to modify post data by using a crafted POST request with the `live_editor_panels_data` parameter.
*   The `action_builder_content` function, also affected by CSRF, processes and echoes `panels_data` , which can contain malicious javascript through the "Text" widget.

**Additional Notes**
*  The Wordfence article mentions that the free and premium versions of their firewall provide protection against this via built-in XSS protection.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 2.10.16 of the plugin.
* CVE-2020-13642 refers to a similar, separate vulnerability affecting the `action_builder_content` function.
