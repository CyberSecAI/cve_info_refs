{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GitLab VS Code extension uses `execa` version 1.0.0, which by default searches for executables in the local project path. This allows an attacker to create a malicious git executable within a project.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The extension uses `execa` with the `preferLocal` option set to true, which allows for arbitrary command execution by placing a malicious executable in the local git directory."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can create a malicious git executable within a project repository. When a user opens this repository with the GitLab VS Code extension, the extension will execute the malicious git binary when invoking `git` commands.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a repository containing the malicious `git` executable and have a victim user open that repository with the GitLab VS Code extension."
