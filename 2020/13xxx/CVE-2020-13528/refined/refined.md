- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information during the configuration of secure credentials for Lantronix XPort EDGE devices. Specifically, TLS private keys and AES encryption/decryption keys are sent over the network without encryption.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
    - Exposure of TLS private keys and AES encryption/decryption keys during configuration.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can capture the transmitted keys by sniffing network communications during configuration.
    - The captured keys enable the attacker to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on encrypted communications.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network sniffing (capturing network communications).
    - The vulnerability can be triggered via crafted HTTP requests, which leads to the information disclosure.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic during device configuration. This requires an on-path position on the network.
    - The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
