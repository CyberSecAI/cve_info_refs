Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-13782:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of special elements used in a command within the `scandir.sgi` component of the D-Link DIR-865L router's web interface. This component is part of the backend engine called `cgibin.exe` which handles web requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The `en` parameter in a specific HTTP request to `__ajax_explorer.sgi` (which is then processed by `scandir.sgi`) is vulnerable to command injection. An attacker can insert arbitrary commands into this parameter, which are then executed by the router with administrative privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router.
*   **Denial of Service:** As demonstrated in the example provided, an attacker can use the vulnerability to cause the router to reboot, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `__ajax_explorer.sgi`.
*   **Specific Parameters:** The request must include the following parameters:
    *   `action`: must be either `mnt` or `umnt`.
    *   `path`: can be any arbitrary value.
    *   `where`: can be any arbitrary value.
    *   `en`: the parameter where the command injection occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attack requires an authenticated session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially bypass the authentication requirement by stealing a valid session cookie. This is made easier because of a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability.
*   **Network Sniffing (Optional):** If the attacker is not in a position to directly interact with the router, they can sniff network traffic to obtain a session cookie if the router is not using HTTPS

**Additional Notes**

*   The specific command injection example provided uses `;reboot;` within the `en` parameter, which causes the router to restart.
*   The vulnerability exists within the context of a web interface controlled by `cgibin.exe`
* The router was running firmware version `1.20B01 Beta`.
*   The vendor has released a beta patch to address the command injection vulnerability as well as other vulnerabilities identified.
