Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `wsse` plugin of the gSOAP toolkit, specifically in how it handles the `KeyIdentifier` element within a SOAP request's `KeyInfo` element.
*   A null pointer dereference occurs when the `ValueType` attribute is missing from a `KeyIdentifier` element.
*   The code retrieves the `ValueType` attribute text, but does not validate if the attribute exists or if the text pointer is valid before using it in `strcmp`, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476):** The core issue is the dereferencing of a null pointer. The `soap_att_get_text` function returns `NULL` if the attribute does not exist. This returned `NULL` value is later used in `strcmp` without proper validation, leading to a crash.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate if the retrieved attribute and its text are valid before using them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending a specially crafted SOAP request without the `ValueType` attribute in a `KeyIdentifier` element, leading to a server crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, meaning the attacker sends a malicious SOAP request via HTTP to the vulnerable server.
*   **SOAP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed SOAP request containing a specific structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior access to the system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resides in the `soap_wsse_verify_EncryptedKey` function in `wsseapi.c`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the absence of the `ValueType` attribute in the `KeyIdentifier` tag within `ds:KeyInfo/xenc:EncryptedKey/ds:KeyInfo` elements.
*   The crash occurs when comparing a `NULL` pointer value to a string using `strcmp`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided crash information includes a stack trace showing the program crashing inside the `strcmp_ssse3` function during the execution of `soap_wsse_verify_EncryptedKey`.
*   The vulnerability exists in gSOAP version 2.8.107, and it was patched in later versions.
*   The advisory also notes that other CVEs, namely CVE-2020-13575, CVE-2020-13576, CVE-2020-13577, and CVE-2020-13578, were also addressed in the same update for gSOAP.
