CVE Description: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

=== Content from openwall.com_7f1e62b9_20250119_111626.html ===
Root cause of vulnerability:  An incorrect access control vulnerability exists in the avatar feature of Grafana.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to lack of authentication when accessing the `/avatar/*` URL and potentially denial of service due to segfault.
Impact of exploitation:
- An unauthenticated attacker can make Grafana send HTTP requests to any URL and return the results to the client, potentially gaining information about the internal network where Grafana is running.
- An attacker can cause a denial of service through a segmentation fault.
Attack vectors: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/avatar/*` endpoint.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker does not need authentication, only access to the Grafana instance via network.
