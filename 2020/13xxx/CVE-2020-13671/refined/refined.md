Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13671:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper filename sanitization in Drupal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper filename sanitization. This suggests that Drupal does not adequately validate or sanitize filenames provided by users, potentially allowing for the inclusion of malicious characters or sequences.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is related to filename handling, therefore, the attack vector would involve uploading or otherwise providing a file with a malicious filename to the Drupal instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to upload or otherwise provide files to the Drupal system and manipulate the filename.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated if the file upload functionality is available to unauthenticated users.
