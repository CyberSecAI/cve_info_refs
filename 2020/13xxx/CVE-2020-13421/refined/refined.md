Based on the provided content, here's the information about CVE-2020-13421:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13421
**Vendor:** OpenIAM
**Software:** OpenIAM
**Affected Version(s):** 4.1.8 (and possibly other versions in 4.1.x)
**Fixed in:** 4.2.0.3
**Vulnerability:** Missing role segregation
**Company:** Accenture
**Reporter:** Marek Klon
**Attribution link:** http://docs.openiam.com/docs-4.2.0/changelog/1-Release-4.2.0

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper role segregation within the OpenIAM software. This means that the system doesn't adequately enforce the separation of privileges between different user roles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing role segregation which leads to privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can gain unauthorized access and elevate their privileges to perform actions beyond their designated role. The affected versions are 4.1.8 and possibly other 4.1.x versions.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker by abusing the missing role segregation. Specific details on how this can be achieved are not included in the provided information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have some level of access to the system, but it is not defined how high or low this level needs to be, nor is the position defined. The vulnerability allows for the attacker to elevate their privileges and obtain more access or ability to perform unauthorized actions.
