Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper masking of Kubernetes cluster tokens when adding a group-level Kubernetes cluster in GitLab. The token is initially masked but can be revealed by clicking a "Show" button on the cluster details page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Data Masking:** The service token, which grants access to the Kubernetes cluster, is not securely stored or handled. It is masked visually by default but can be easily revealed.
- **Information Disclosure:** The "Show" button allows unauthorized users with access to the GitLab group's cluster page to view sensitive cluster tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Access to Kubernetes Cluster:** An attacker who obtains the Kubernetes cluster token can gain full control over the associated Kubernetes cluster.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Depending on the cluster's configuration, this could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and other malicious actions within the Kubernetes environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the GitLab web interface itself where the cluster details page is exposed.
- **Direct Access to Group:** Any user who can access the group's cluster page within GitLab can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **GitLab Access:** The attacker must have access to the GitLab instance and be able to navigate to the group's cluster configuration page.
- **No special permissions:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or elevated permissions within GitLab or in the cluster itself, only access to the page displaying cluster details.

**Additional Details:**
- The report mentions that this issue was present in GitLab Enterprise Edition 12.3.0-pre.
- The vulnerability was discovered by user `xanbanx` and reported via HackerOne.
- The vulnerability is described in a HackerOne report (#702796).
- The suggested fix was to remove the 'Show' button to prevent token reveal.
