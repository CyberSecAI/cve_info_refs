- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Drupal core Form API does not properly handle certain form input from cross-site requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of form input from cross-site requests by the Drupal core Form API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to other unspecified vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through cross-site requests, meaning an attacker would need to trick a user into submitting a malicious form request to a vulnerable Drupal site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious request that targets a Drupal site and trick a user into submitting it. The attacker does not require direct access to the Drupal site or its server.
