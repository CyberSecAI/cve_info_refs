# Drupal core - Critical - Cross Site Request Forgery - SA-CORE-2020-004

Project: [Drupal core](/project/drupal)Date: 2020-June-17Security risk: [**Critical** 15 ∕ 25 AC:Complex/A:None/CI:Some/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:All](/security-team/risk-levels "AC - Access complexity: Complex or highly specific (multi-step, unintuitive process with high number of dependencies)
A - Authentication: None (all/anonymous users)
CI - Confidentiality impact: Certain non-public data is released
II - Integrity impact: Some data can be modified
E - Exploit (Zero-day impact): Theoretical or white-hat (no public exploit code or documentation on development exists)
TD - Target distribution: All module configurations are exploitable")Vulnerability: Cross Site Request ForgeryAffected versions: >=7.0 <7.72 || >= 8.0.0 <8.8.8 || >= 8.9.0 <8.9.1 || >=9.0.0 <9.0.1CVE IDs: CVE-2020-13663Description:

The Drupal core Form API does not properly handle certain form input from cross-site requests, which can lead to other vulnerabilities.

Solution:

* If you are using Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal 7.72](/project/drupal/releases/7.72).
* If you are using Drupal 8.8.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.8.8](/project/drupal/releases/8.8.8).
* If you are using Drupal 8.9.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.9.1](/project/drupal/releases/8.9.1).
* If you are using Drupal 9.0.x, upgrade to [Drupal 9.0.1](/project/drupal/releases/9.0.1).

Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.8.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage. Sites on 8.7.x or earlier should update to 8.8.8.
