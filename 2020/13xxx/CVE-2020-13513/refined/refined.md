Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-13513:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `WinRing0x64` driver used by NZXT CAM software. This driver allows the software to interact with the Windows kernel and perform privileged operations like accessing PCI devices and making CPU/GPU configurations.
- The driver exposes functionality through I/O Request Packets (IRPs) that can be accessed by any user on the system.
- Specifically, IRP with code `0x9c40a0dc` allows a low-privilege user to directly use the `OUT` instruction with a 2-byte (word) write to a specified processor I/O port. This `OUT` instruction is executed with elevated privileges by the driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The driver doesn't properly restrict access to privileged hardware instructions. It allows low-privilege users to write arbitrary data to I/O ports via IRP `0x9c40a0dc`.
- **Unrestricted I/O Port Access:**  The `OUT` instruction is executed without any constraints or sanitization, allowing a low-privilege user to potentially write to any I/O port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privilege user can gain elevated privileges by writing to critical I/O ports, which could lead to arbitrary code execution and complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious IRP:** An attacker can send a crafted I/O Request Packet (IRP) with the code `0x9c40a0dc` to the `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` device created by the driver.
- **Direct I/O Port Manipulation:** The attacker then has the ability to write a 2-byte word to an arbitrary I/O port through the `OUT` instruction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low-Privilege Access:** An attacker only needs low-privilege access to the system.
- **Ability to Send IRPs:** The attacker needs to be able to send I/O Request Packets to the `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` device.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability is one of three related vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-13512, CVE-2020-13513, and CVE-2020-13514) affecting the same driver. The other two CVEs involve different IRP codes that also grant the ability to write to I/O ports, with 1-byte and 4-byte sizes respectively.
- The affected software is NZXT CAM 4.8.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Carl Hurd of Cisco Talos.
