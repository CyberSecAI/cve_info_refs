Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13127

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `TASKS_LIST__pt.querystring` parameter.

**Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically the `/queuemetrics/tpf` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. This can lead to various consequences:
   - Data breaches (accessing, modifying, deleting sensitive information)
   - Privilege escalation by manipulating user roles within the application
   - Application compromise

**Attack Vector:**
   - The attack is carried out over the network.
   - The vulnerable endpoint is `/queuemetrics/tpf`.
   - The injection point is the `TASKS_LIST__pt.querystring` parameter in the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
   - The attacker must be authenticated.
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Affected Application**: Loway QueueMetrics before 19.04.1

**Fixed Version**: 19.10

**Severity**: High

**CVSS**: 8.1
