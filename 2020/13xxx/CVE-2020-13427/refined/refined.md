Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `user_name`, `user_firstname`, and `user_lastname` POST parameters when adding a new user. Specifically, it fails to neutralize or encode special characters that are part of XSS payloads, such as `<script>` tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input validation or sanitization for user-provided data. It directly stores the malicious input into the database, leading to persistent XSS.
*   **Persistent XSS:** The injected script is stored persistently in the database, meaning the malicious payload will execute every time an admin views the user list or details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, potentially leading to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the cookies of logged-in administrators.
    *   **Data Theft:** Reading sensitive information displayed on the admin panel.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modifying the visual appearance of the application.
    *   **Administrative Actions:** Performing administrative actions on behalf of the targeted admin, like deleting/modifying data, adding new users or modifying admin rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to the `/phpmaster/admin/users.php?source=add_user` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Payloads in Form Data:** The POST request includes malicious `<script>` tags embedded within the `user_name`, `user_firstname`, and `user_lastname` form data fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to access the add user form or be able to send crafted requests to the application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker must know that `user_name`, `user_firstname`, and `user_lastname` parameters are vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit details an example of how to inject the malicious payload.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Victor CMS version 1.0.
*   The exploit-db entry does not assign a CVE but this analysis relates to the vulnerability that is identified.
