The provided content is a Talos Intelligence vulnerability report for CVE-2020-13531, which is a use-after-free vulnerability in Pixar OpenUSD.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stale reference (`srcPath`) to a freed object within the `_EvalRefOrPayloadArcs` function during the processing of USD files. The function saves the SDF path of the current node, but further node processing within the loop can change the node's path, making `srcPath` a stale reference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability when processing a list of references for a prim in USD files.
- Improper handling of layer offsets in references, specifically when the scale property is 0, leading to invalid inverse calculations and triggering the use-after-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption
- Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by controlling the freed memory using crafted USDA files.

**Attack vectors:**
- By opening a specially crafted malformed USD file provided by an attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malformed USD file.
- The victim needs to open the attacker-provided file, triggering the vulnerability.
