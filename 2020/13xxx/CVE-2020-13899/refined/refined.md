  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `janus_process_incoming_request` function in `janus.c` discloses information from uninitialized stack memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure via uninitialized stack memory. This is related to CWE-909, which indicates the use of an uninitialized resource.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker may be able to obtain sensitive information from the server's memory. The disclosed information could potentially be used to further compromise the system or gain unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to the `janus-gateway` server that trigger the vulnerable code path within `janus_process_incoming_request`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `janus-gateway` server, typically via an API exposed by the server."
