- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to the application trusting a 16-bit length value read from a malformed Excel file's SST record, leading to a memory copy into a statically sized buffer that can overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122). The application fails to properly validate the record length, leading to a buffer overflow when copying data into a fixed-size buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the heap-based buffer overflow, leading to a compromise of the application and potentially the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted malicious Excel file (.xls) with SoftMaker Office PlanMaker. The malformed file contains an SST record with an oversized length parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious Excel file and have a victim user open the file with the vulnerable software. No special network access or privileges are needed on the target system.
