Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability in the WebSocket functionality of WebKitGTK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Use-After-Free (CWE-416):** The vulnerability occurs when a WebSocket object (`ws`) is freed prematurely, and then an attempt is made to access it. This happens due to a specific sequence of actions involving document reloads and event handlers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is achieved through carefully crafted web content and potentially heap grooming to exploit the use-after-free.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can also lead to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker needs to entice a user to visit a specially crafted web page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker must be able to host or deliver the malicious web page to the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the malicious web page, which is considered a user-initiated action.

**Technical Details:**
1.  The vulnerability lies in how the `WebSocket` object is handled during document reloads.
2.  A malicious webpage can trigger the vulnerability through Javascript code.
3.  The Javascript code obtains a reference to the parent document, creates a WebSocket object, assigns an `onerror` event handler which releases the WebSocket object.
4.  The `onerror` handler adds the parent html object to current document body. This action causes the WebSocket object to be released.
5.  The `ws.close()` call, which comes after the object is released, then causes a use-after-free.
6.  Proper heap grooming during the exploitation allows the attacker full control over the use-after-free, enabling arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in WebKitGTK version 2.30.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin ‘Icewall’ Noga of Cisco Talos.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 8.8.
*   The vulnerability was patched by the vendor on 2020-11-19, and publicly disclosed on 2020-11-30.
