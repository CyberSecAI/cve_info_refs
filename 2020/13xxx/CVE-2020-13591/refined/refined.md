- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `entities_id` parameter in the `access_rules/rules_form` page is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, as well as other database-related attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the vulnerable page with a crafted `entities_id` parameter.
    - The request can be sent by an authenticated attacker, or via CSRF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
    - The attacker needs to either have administrator privileges or trick a user into performing a CSRF attack.
