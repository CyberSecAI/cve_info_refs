- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An incorrectly sized comparison within `FreryIEC104ServerSim.exe` leads to an infinite loop when processing packets for display, causing memory exhaustion. The comparison involves a word (2 bytes) and a byte (1 byte), causing the byte loop index to overflow before the loop breaks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Comparison of incompatible types (word vs. byte)
  - Infinite loop due to incorrect comparison logic
  - Memory exhaustion vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (program crash due to memory exhaustion)
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted packet with a size greater than 0xFF bytes to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the server. No specific authentication is mentioned.
