    "Verified": "true",
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-13547",
    "CWE": "CWE-843 - Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (‘Type Confusion’)",
    "Summary": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Software’s Foxit PDF Reader, version 10.1.0.37527. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger an improper use of an object, resulting in memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Affected_Product": "Foxit Reader",
    "Affected_Version": "10.1.0.37527",
    "Vulnerability_Details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `openPlayer` function within the PDF JavaScript API. This function expects an optional argument of type `PlayerArgs`, a JavaScript object with properties, including `annot` for annotations. The type confusion arises when `openPlayer` is invoked with an object of a different type that still possesses the `annot` property. This leads to memory corruption.",
    "Root_Cause": "Type confusion in the `openPlayer` function when handling the `annot` property.",
    "Attack_Vector": "A specially crafted PDF document.",
    "Impact": "Memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attacker_Capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
