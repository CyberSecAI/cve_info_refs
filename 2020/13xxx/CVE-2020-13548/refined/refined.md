- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition in Foxit Reader's JavaScript engine when handling events on a text field with specific properties. Specifically, a field is removed while its objects are still in use, leading to a crash when those freed objects are later accessed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416) in the JavaScript engine.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially gain full control over the victim's system by crafting a malicious PDF.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted PDF document. The vulnerability can be triggered by a user opening the malicious PDF or, if the browser plugin is enabled, by visiting a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file, or have them visit a malicious website if the browser plugin is enabled.
