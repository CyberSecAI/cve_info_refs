{
  "CVE-2020-13151": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient blacklisting of functions in lua UDFs. Specifically, while `os.execute` calls were blocked during UDF execution, `io.popen` calls were not.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient blacklisting of functions in lua UDFs."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the underlying aerospike database host, potentially leading to a shell, a pivot point in the network, and the ability to drop ssh keys.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted lua UDF, taking advantage of the ability to execute arbitrary OS commands using `io.popen` due to insufficient blacklisting, can be registered with the Aerospike server and then executed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs network access to an unpatched Aerospike server. The community edition of the server does not require authentication, making exploitation easier. For the enterprise edition, credentials are likely required."
