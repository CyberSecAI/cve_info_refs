The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13534.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect default permissions assigned to certain files and DCOM server applications installed by Dream Report 5 R20-2. Specifically, the files and COM objects have "full control" permissions granted to "Everyone," allowing any user on the system to modify or replace them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276): The vulnerability arises from the overly permissive default permissions, granting "full control" to "Everyone" on critical files and DCOM objects.
- DCOM Server Application Privilege Escalation: The identified DCOM CLSIDs with weak permissions can be abused for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` (or a higher level of privilege).
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By replacing or modifying the vulnerable files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack vector is local access since the attacker must already have access to the system.
- Malicious File/Component Replacement: An attacker can exploit the weak permissions by replacing legitimate files/components with malicious ones, which will be executed with elevated privileges.
- DCOM Object Abuse: The attacker can invoke or manipulate the DCOM objects to execute their malicious code with elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- The attacker must have the ability to write to the directories with the vulnerable files, and or the ability to modify the vulnerable DCOM Objects..
