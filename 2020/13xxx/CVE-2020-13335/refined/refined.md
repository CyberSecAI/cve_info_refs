{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application did not properly handle account deletion when the user owned a group. It allowed a user to schedule their account for removal despite owning a group, which should not be possible.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete access control",
       "Incorrect message handling during account deletion"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is primarily related to a misleading message to the user. The user is informed that their account has been scheduled for deletion which might not be true, depending on whether the account deletion would have been completed or not. There is no indication of actual data loss or unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a user attempting to delete their account when they are the owner of a group within the platform.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a registered user on the platform and also be the owner of at least one group. They must be able to access their account settings and group settings."
