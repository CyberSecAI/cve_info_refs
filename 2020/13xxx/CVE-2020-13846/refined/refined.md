Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-13846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure in Sylabs Singularity versions 3.5.0 through 3.5.3 to properly report errors when verifying the signatures of objects within a SIF container using the `--all` or `-a` options. Even if some objects in the container are unsigned or fail verification, the `singularity verify` command returns a success status code (0).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Error Handling:**  The `singularity verify` command does not correctly report verification failures when using the `--all` or `-a` options, leading to a false positive. It will output warnings, but return a success code.
*   **Insecure Verification Process:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that although the tool reports warnings about missing signatures for objects, it still returns a success status.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Integrity:** An attacker could modify a signed container by injecting unsigned or malicious objects. The signature verification would pass due to the vulnerability, leading to the execution of potentially malicious code.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Workflows that rely on the exit code of `singularity verify` as a means of trust are vulnerable to executing modified containers.
*   **Malicious behavior:** By introducing malicious objects that are not verified, an attacker can cause the container to exhibit unexpected and potentially dangerous behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated SIF Container:** An attacker can modify a legitimate signed SIF container by adding unsigned or tampered objects. The attacker would then distribute this modified image.
*   **Exploitation of Trust:** Users who rely on the output of `singularity verify -a` to ensure image integrity would be misled into running a compromised container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Modify SIF Images:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify SIF container images by adding unsigned or altered objects.
*   **Distribution:** The attacker needs a method to distribute the manipulated image to the target.
*   **User reliance on `singularity verify` output:** The user needs to be reliant on the verification output.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Singularity version 3.6.0, which introduces a new signature format and changes to the signing/verification code.
*   Singularity 3.6.0 includes a `--legacy-insecure` flag for `singularity verify` that allows for verifying older, insecure signatures for compatibility with existing containers but this does not fully address the security issues present in older versions.
* The issue has been addressed in openSUSE by updating to singularity 3.6.0
* The issue is tracked as GHSA-6w7g-p4jh-rf92 on GitHub.
