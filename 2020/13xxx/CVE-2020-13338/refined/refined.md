Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2020-13338:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way GitLab's `ReferenceRedactorFilter` processes and redacts references in markdown. Specifically, the `data-original` attribute of a redacted node is not properly sanitized. This attribute stores HTML encoded data which, when extracted and used as link content, gets unencoded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious HTML code can be injected into markdown through a crafted `data-original` attribute. The injected HTML is then rendered when the markdown is displayed.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the content of the `data-original` attribute, allowing HTML to be stored and later interpreted by the browser.
*   **Reliance on HTML Encoding:** The system trusts HTML encoded data, assuming it will not be rendered as active HTML, which is incorrect when the data is subsequently unencoded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into GitLab pages where markdown is rendered.
*   **XSS Execution:** The injected HTML can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious actions
*   **Bypass of CSP (with additional user interaction):** While GitLab has a Content Security Policy (CSP), it can be bypassed as shown in the report, which can lead to the execution of scripts from the attacker's control. This requires a single click on the page by the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Markdown Injection:** The attack vector involves crafting a special markdown link that exploits the `ReferenceRedactorFilter`.
*   **Cross-Project Referencing:** The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a malicious link in one project and referencing it in another project where the user does not have permissions to view the source project.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab User Account:** The attacker needs a GitLab user account to create projects, issues or comments.
*   **Ability to Create Markdown Content:** The attacker needs to be able to create markdown content, such as in issues, comments, etc.
*   **Knowledge of Target's Accessibility:** The attacker needs to know the target user is viewing content that will trigger the flawed `ReferenceRedactor`
