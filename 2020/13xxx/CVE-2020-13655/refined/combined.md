GAMEPLAY: Graph Analysis for Mechanized Exploit generation and Patching Leveraging human Assistance for improved Yield

The GAMEPLAY project aims to improve the processes software vulnerabilities detection, exploit generation, and patching. Gameplay is part of the CHESS DARPA program (Computers and Humans Exploring Software Security) whose goal is to "research the effectiveness of enabling computers and humans to collaboratively reason over software artifacts, such as source code and compiled binaries". In GAMEPLAY, we are building tools and methods to discover vulnerabilities and generate exploits for PHP, Javascript, and C/C binaries.

4. Cross site scripting in Collabtive (CVE-2020-13655)

# Cross site scripting in Collabtive (CVE-2020-13655)

## Cross site scripting in collabtive [Heading link](#cross-site-scripting-in-collabtive) xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"? Copy link

A cross site scripting vulnerability is present in Collabtive 3.0 and later (including the latest version, 3.1)

We contacted the developers for a disclosure on May 4th 2020, but as of August 24th 2020, we didn’t receive any answer after multiple followups.

The vulnerability was found automatically by the NAVEX project, in the file [managefile.php](https://github.com/philippK-de/Collabtive/blob/master/managefile.php), around line 296. Here’s the relevant code snippet:

```
$action = getArrayVal($_GET, "action");

/* Not relevant code omitted... */

elseif ($action == "movefile") {
    /* Not relevant code omitted... */

    $file = $_GET["file"];
   // $file = substr($file, 4, strlen($file)-4);

    $target = $_GET["target"];
    echo "$target $file";
    echo  $fileObj->moveFile($file, $target);

```

This endpoint is meant to be called by Javascript code in the frontend, and returns some text as a feedback to the user of the status of the requested operation.

However, due to the lack of CSRF protection, and the (default) setting of the Content-Type header to text/html, an attacker can craft a malicious URL which, when visited, will reflect the file and target variables without any escaping, thus executing JavaScript code.
