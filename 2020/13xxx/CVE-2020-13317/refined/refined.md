{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient type checking on GraphQL API when deleting snippets.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `destroySnippet` mutation in the GraphQL API does not properly validate the type of object it is operating on. It uses `GitlabSchema.object_from_id` which can return any object the user has permissions on, instead of verifying if it's a Snippet object. This allows a maintainer to pass the ID of a DiffNote, which triggers the `Repositories::DestroyService` to delete the entire project repository instead of the intended snippet.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A maintainer with access to a project can delete the project's repository by exploiting this vulnerability through the GraphQL API, which they normally do not have permission to do. This can lead to loss of project data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the GraphQL API endpoint, specifically the `destroySnippet` mutation. An attacker needs to craft a malicious request with the ID of a DiffNote instead of a Snippet.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a Maintainer of a project and must have access to the GraphQL endpoint. They need to be able to create a DiffNote in the project, then use the `/-/graphiql-explorer` to execute the malicious GraphQL query."
