Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13378

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `waf_filename` parameter within the `/lbadmin/ajax/js_dispatcher.php` script. This allows for the injection of arbitrary OS commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application executes a system command using unsanitized user input. Specifically, the `waf_filename` parameter is incorporated into a `chown` command, without proper escaping or validation, allowing the attacker to inject malicious commands through shell metacharacters (`|`, `` ` ``).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected server. This can lead to a full compromise of the system, including data theft, modification, or complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/lbadmin/ajax/js_dispatcher.php`. The malicious payload is included in the `waf_filename` parameter.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates that the vulnerability requires an attacker to have valid user credentials, and is not exploitable anonymously.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs valid login credentials to the Loadbalancer.org appliance's administrative interface to be able to make the malicious request.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Loadbalancer.org appliance's administrative interface.
