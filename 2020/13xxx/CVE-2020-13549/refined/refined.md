- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the Sytech XL Reporter installation directory. Specifically, the "Authenticated Users" and "Everyone" groups have "Full/Change" permissions on the `XLRiRuntime.exe` service binary, which runs with NT SYSTEM authority.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) on the installation directory.
    - Ability for authenticated users and the "Everyone" group to modify the service binary and other files within the installation directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Local privilege escalation. Attackers can overwrite service executables and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the service (NT SYSTEM).
    - Attackers can replace other files in the install directory leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access to the machine.
    - Overwriting service executables or other files within the installation directory due to weak file system permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Must be a local user with write access to the Sytech XL Reporter install directory.
    - No special privileges required, an authenticated user is enough.
