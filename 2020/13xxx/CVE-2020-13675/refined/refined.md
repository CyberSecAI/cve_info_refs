- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JSON:API and REST/File modules in Drupal do not correctly perform all file validations when handling file uploads through their HTTP APIs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Access bypass due to insufficient file validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker might be able to upload files that bypass the file validation process implemented by modules on the site, potentially leading to malicious file uploads and other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to a file upload via JSON:API or REST can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to a file upload via JSON:API or REST, which implies some form of authentication or access to the relevant endpoints. Additionally, the target site must have either JSON:API or REST file upload modules enabled and also use a file validation module.
