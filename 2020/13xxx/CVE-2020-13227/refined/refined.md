Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-13227:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insecure permissions and information disclosure via error handling.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application does not properly handle invalid path permission errors.
- The application leaks the username of the web server process when an invalid path is requested.
- The fakepath protection mechanism is bypassed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can determine the username under which the web server is running.

**Attack vectors:**
- By triggering an invalid path permission error by sending a crafted request to the web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
- No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is triggered by requesting a non-existent file using the `pid` parameter in the `/scgi` endpoint. The error response reveals the username of the process running the webserver, which is normally not accessible to an external user.

Example request:
```
http://192.168.88.131/scgi?sid=7d2ec36cd2f0a42929a5672c9cc5f0320a666155&pid=transferpage2_name1_(folder_where_you_don't_have_permissions).htm
```

Example using a specific non-existent folder:
```
http://192.168.88.131/scgi?sid=7d2ec36cd2f0a42929a5672c9cc5f0320a666155&pid=transferpage2_name1_johnfolder.htm
