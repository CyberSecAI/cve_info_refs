Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13886:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content directly references "CVE-2020-13886" and describes an exploit targeting Intelbras TIP 200, 200 LITE and 300 VoIP devices. The github repository name is also CVE-2020-13886. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability caused by insufficient sanitization of the `page` parameter in the `/cgi-bin/cgiServer.exx` endpoint. This allows directory traversal.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include local files by manipulating the `page` parameter.
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to navigate the file system using `../` sequences, thereby gaining access to files outside the intended directory.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the device, including system configuration files like `/etc/shadow` which contains password hashes.
    *   **Potential Code Execution:**  While not directly stated, LFI vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution by including code from other locations.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint. The `page` parameter in the URL is manipulated to perform directory traversal.
    *   **Example Attack Vector:** `http://HOST/cgi-bin/cgiServer.exx?page=../../../../etc/shadow`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target device.
    *   **No Authentication:**  The provided information implies that the LFI vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Details from the Content (Beyond typical CVE description):**

*   **Affected Product Versions:** The vulnerability affects Intelbras TIP 200, TIP 200 LITE and TIP 300 devices. Specific firmware versions mentioned are TIP 200/200 LITE (60.61.75.15) and TIP 300 (65.61.75.22), but likely extends to other firmwares.
*   **Exploitation Example:** The content provides a practical example of how to exploit the vulnerability to read the `/etc/shadow` file, which can lead to unauthorized access or further compromise.
*   **Proof of Concept:**  A link to a YouTube video PoC was included in the README of the github repo.
*   **Attribution:** The discoverer of the vulnerability is identified as Lucas Souza, a pentester at ProsecT.

In summary, this content provides a detailed explanation of a LFI vulnerability (CVE-2020-13886) affecting certain Intelbras VoIP devices, including practical attack vectors, impact and root cause of the vulnerability.
