# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1125

## Pixar OpenUSD binary file format specs memory corruption

##### November 12, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13524

### Summary

An out-of-bounds memory corruption vulnerability exists in the way Pixar OpenUSD 20.05 uses SPECS data from binary USD files. A specially crafted malformed file can trigger an out-of-bounds memory access and modification which results in memory corruption. To trigger this vulnerability, the victim needs to access an attacker-provided malformed file.

### Tested Versions

Pixar OpenUSD 20.05

Apple macOS Catalina 10.15.3

### Product URLs

<https://openusd.org>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

### CWE

CWE-119 - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

### Details

OpenUSD stands for Open Universal Scene Descriptor and is a software suite by Pixar that facilitates, among other things, interchange of arbitrary 3-D scenes that may be composed of many elemental assets.

Most notably, USD and its backing file format `usd` are used on Apple iOS and macOS as part of ModelIO framework in support of SceneKit and ARKit for sharing and displaying 3D scenes in, for example, augmented reality applications. On macOS, these files are automatically rendered to generate thumbnails, while on iOS they can be shared via iMessage and opened with user interaction.

USD binary file format consists of a header pointing to a table of contents that in turn points to individual sections that comprise the whole file. The `SPECS` section of the file consists of three distinct arrays of integers which are used to connect previously reconstructed paths with sets of fields and their types. For a sample file, these might look like:

```
Path Indexes: [0, 1, 2, 3]
FSet Indexes: [0, 5, 9, 12]
Spec Types: [7, 6, 6, 6]

```

Path indices point into PATHS array, fset indices point into start of field sets and specs into tokens. Specs structure can be considered a root structure for the given USD scene as everything flows from it. When the memory structures are reconstructed by parsing the file, these are being additionally processed into object model after the file is fully parsed. For example, the following code from `crateData.cpp`:

```
    struct _SpecToPair {
        using result_type = _FlatMap::value_type;
        explicit _SpecToPair(CrateFile *crateFile) : crateFile(crateFile) {}
        result_type operator()(CrateFile::Spec const &spec) const {
                result_type r(crateFile->GetPath(spec.pathIndex),                                           [1]
                          _FlatSpecData(Usd_EmptySharedTag));
            TF_AXIOM(!r.first.IsTargetPath());
            return r;
        }
        CrateFile *crateFile;
    };

```

Note that at [1] in the above code a property `pathIndex` is directly dereferenced and a concrete path object is retrieved from path vector via `GetPath`. Value passed into `GetPath` is used as an index into a vector of previously reconstructed paths. Since no check is performed to ensure the index is less than the size of the vector, out of bounds memory access can happen. By supplying a large value for path index inside SPECS structure in the binary file format, an out of bounds memory access will lead to undefined behavior. These indices are 32 bit integers allowing for a large range of out of bounds access values in the above code at [1] and other places inside `_PopulateFromCrateFile` function. With precise memory layout control and in combination with other reported issues, it is possible that this vulnerability could be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution.

### Crash Information

Different crashes can be observed, depending on the memory layout and out of bounds value accessed. Following example shows a wild pointer:
