{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of bounds checking when accessing the path vector in the `_PopulateFromCrateFile` function within the Pixar OpenUSD library. The `pathIndex` from the SPECS structure is directly used as an index into the path vector without any validation. A large crafted `pathIndex` leads to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Memory corruption",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption. The provided crash information shows examples of wild pointer dereferences and heap-buffer-overflows.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted USD file",
      "The victim needs to access an attacker-provided malformed file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malformed USD file with a large `pathIndex` inside the SPECS structure."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided Talos report offers specific details on the vulnerable code location within the OpenUSD library and provides example crash information, which is more detailed than the provided CVE description."
