The provided content refers to a fix for issue #93 in the `rust-vmm/vm-memory` repository, specifically addressing "torn writes" when using `memcpy`. This is related to CVE-2020-13759.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the potential for "torn writes" when using the `memcpy` function in the `vm-memory` library.
- Torn writes can occur when a write operation to memory is interrupted, leaving the memory in an inconsistent state. This can happen on systems without atomic memory operations for the given data size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Non-atomic writes using `memcpy`.
- Potential data corruption due to inconsistent memory states during write operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption in the virtual machine's memory space.
- Unpredictable behavior of the virtual machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during memory copy operations using `memcpy` within the virtual machine's memory management.
- An attacker could trigger this condition by manipulating the virtual machine's memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to influence the memory operations within the virtual machine.
- This usually implies control of the virtual machine guest or malicious activity within the guest.
