  "cveId": "CVE-2020-13962",
  "description": "Qt 5.12.2 through 5.14.2 mishandles OpenSSL's error queue, which can cause a denial of service to QSslSocket users. Because errors leak in unrelated TLS sessions, an unrelated session may be disconnected when any handshake fails.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of OpenSSL's error queue within the QtNetwork library. Specifically, the `SSL_shutdown()` function call within `QSslSocket` can trigger an error in OpenSSL which, if not correctly handled, can lead to errors leaking into unrelated TLS sessions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Resource leak (error queue leak)",
      "Denial of Service Vulnerability"
     ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can cause denial of service by disconnecting unrelated TLS sessions when any handshake fails. This can lead to random disconnections of authenticated clients, potentially disrupting services that rely on `QSslSocket`.",
    "attackVectors": "The attack vector is remote, over a network. An attacker can trigger a handshake failure, causing the error queue to leak. This results in unrelated TLS sessions being disconnected.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate TLS handshakes with a server utilizing the vulnerable version of Qt. The attacker doesn't require any prior authentication or special privileges."

        {
       "name": "SUSE Liberty Linux",
        "version": "8"
    }
   ],
  "remediation": "Update to libqt5-qtbase version 5.12.7-4.3.1 or higher (or equivalent based on distro). The patch fixes how `SSL_shutdown` errors are handled within Qt's `QSslSocket` class, preventing errors from leaking into other unrelated TLS sessions.",
  "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability is triggered by a flaw in how Qt handles OpenSSL's error queue. The fix involves handling the `SSL_shutdown()` function's errors correctly and also cherry-picking an upstream commit related to an OOB read during certificate parsing."
