Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13777:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content clearly relates to CVE-2020-13777, as indicated by:

*   Explicit mention of `CVE-2020-13777` in multiple sources (e.g., bugzilla, Red Hat advisories, Fedora update notifications, SUSE advisories, Ubuntu notices, and mailing lists).
*   Consistent description across sources, referencing a "session resumption works without master key" issue in GnuTLS.
*   Specific references to the vulnerability allowing MITM attacks.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from GnuTLS servers not securely constructing session ticket encryption keys. The encryption key is not being securely tied to application-supplied secret. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to incorrect cryptography used for encrypting a session ticket. Until the first key rotation, the TLS server always uses wrong data in place of an encryption key. This issue was introduced in GnuTLS version 3.6.4 due to a commit error.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insecure handling of session ticket encryption keys.
    *   Incorrect cryptography used for encrypting a session ticket.
    *   Lack of access control on issued tickets
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **TLS 1.3:**  Allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) server without valid credentials to resume sessions with a client that first established a secure connection with a legitimate server. This bypasses TLS 1.3 authentication.
    *   **TLS 1.2:** May enable attackers to recover previous conversations by exploiting session resumption mechanisms.
    *   Potential disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   Loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
    *   Network-based attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to intercept network traffic between client and server.
    *   Ability to act as a malicious server or control a compromised server.
    *   No user interaction required.
    *   Attacker does not need valid credentials, in the case of TLS 1.3 session resumption bypass

**3. Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** GnuTLS versions from 3.6.4 up to (but not including) 3.6.14 are vulnerable. Versions before 3.6.4 are not affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Initially, no mitigation was available, requiring a full patch. However, the patch for the vulnerability was addressed in GnuTLS version 3.6.14 and subsequent versions, as well as specific distribution releases.
*  **Affected Products:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0, 8.1 and 8 and Fedora 31, 32; Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, 19.10, several SUSE products, and their respective cloud images; also affects openSUSE Leap 15.1 and Tumbleweed
*   **Upstream Issue:** The bug was first identified and tracked upstream at [https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011).
*   **SUSE Details:**  SUSE rated the vulnerability as having an important severity, and provided CVSS v3 scores of 7.4.
