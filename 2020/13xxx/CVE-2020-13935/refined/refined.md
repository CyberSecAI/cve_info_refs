Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13935:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided documents explicitly mention "CVE-2020-13935" and describe a vulnerability related to WebSocket frame payload length validation in Apache Tomcat.
   - This aligns with the official description of CVE-2020-13935, which is about a vulnerability in Apache Tomcat where "The payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause lies in the insufficient validation of the payload length within WebSocket frames processed by Apache Tomcat.
   - Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the server does not check if the provided payload length of a WebSocket frame is valid, potentially leading to a crash.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Inadequate Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, specifically the payload length field in WebSocket frames.
   - **Infinite Loop:** An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted WebSocket frames with invalid payload lengths which can lead to an infinite loop.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service condition. Specifically, the server can get stuck in an infinite loop consuming CPU resources, or potentially exhaust memory leading to application crashes.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network-Based Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted WebSocket frames over the network to a vulnerable Apache Tomcat server.
   - **Direct Connection:** As mentioned in the Suse advisory the vulnerability can be triggered by an h2c direct connection.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote Attacker:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated, nor local to the vulnerable system and can initiate the attack from a remote position over the network.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Apache Tomcat server's WebSocket endpoint.
   - **Knowledge of Websocket Protocol:** Attacker would need to craft malicious websocket messages with an invalid payload length.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Apache Tomcat handles WebSocket frame payloads. Specifically:

*   **Insufficient Validation:** Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.36, 8.5.0 to 8.5.56, and 7.0.27 to 7.0.104 do not sufficiently validate the payload length in WebSocket frames.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can send malicious websocket messages containing invalid payload length values.
*   **Impact:** This flaw can trigger an infinite loop in the server, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability is resolved by upgrading to the following Apache Tomcat versions:
    *   10.0.0-M7 or later
    *   9.0.37 or later
    *   8.5.57 or later
    *   7.0.105 or later.
