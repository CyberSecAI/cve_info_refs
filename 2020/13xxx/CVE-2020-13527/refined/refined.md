- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Lantronix XPort EDGE Web Manager application does not properly protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352). The application uses a session-based authentication mechanism. After a user logs in, subsequent requests from the user's browser are granted the same privileges as the original authenticated GET request. This allows an attacker to craft malicious web pages that submit POST requests, leading to unauthorized configuration changes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify configuration data, potentially enabling or disabling services (like telnet), modifying user credentials, and changing the serial line configuration. This can result in denial of access for legitimate users, unauthorized access to the device through telnet, or denial of access to serial line data.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page that sends a POST request to the vulnerable device. The victim, while logged into the device's web interface, visits this malicious page, causing their browser to send an unauthorized request to the device without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious webpage. The victim needs to have a valid session with the vulnerable device and visit the malicious webpage.
