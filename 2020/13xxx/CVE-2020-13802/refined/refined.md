Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of URLs used in the `rebar.config` file within the Rebar3 tool. Specifically, the `rebar_utils:sh` function, which executes shell commands, receives unsanitized input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by crafting a malicious URL in the `rebar.config` file.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `rebar_utils:escape_chars` function, intended to prevent command injection, only escapes a limited set of characters, leaving it vulnerable to bypass. Characters like `|`, `\t`, `~`, `<`, and `>` were not properly escaped allowing for the injection of shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system where Rebar3 is being used. This could lead to a full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URL in `rebar.config`:** An attacker can introduce a malicious URL within the `rebar.config` file of a project. This file is used by Rebar3 to manage dependencies and configurations.
- **Dependency Fetching:** The vulnerability is triggered during the dependency fetching process, making it a potent attack vector. Any Rebar3 action that involves fetching dependencies is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Modify `rebar.config`:** The attacker needs to be able to modify or inject a malicious `rebar.config` file into the target project.
- **Trigger Dependency Resolution:** The attacker needs to trigger a Rebar3 action (such as `clean`, `compile`, `deps`, etc.) that causes the tool to fetch dependencies, thereby executing the malicious URL.

**More Details than CVE:**

- The provided content offers more technical details than a typical CVE description, including:
    - The specific vulnerable function (`rebar_utils:sh`) and its location in the source code.
    - The inadequate sanitization function (`rebar_utils:escape_chars`) and the specific characters that it fails to escape.
    - A specific example of a malicious URL that can be used to exploit the vulnerability
    - The range of vulnerable Rebar3 versions (3.0.0-beta.3 to 3.13.2)
    - A list of all Rebar3 actions that could trigger the vulnerability
    - A link to the remediation commit

The content clearly demonstrates a shell command injection vulnerability through a crafted URL that bypasses the intended sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution.
