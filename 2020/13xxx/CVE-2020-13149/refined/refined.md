The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities. Here's an analysis of the relevant parts concerning CVE-2020-13149:

**Vulnerability:** Local Privilege escalation due to weak ACL

**Vulnerable Version:** Dragon Center 2 - 2.5.1905.3001 & Prior

**Fixed Version:** Dragon Center 2 - 2.6.x & Later

**Vulnerable Binaries:** Dragon Center.exe (C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI\MSI Remind Manager)

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure file permissions on the "C:\ProgramData\MSI\Dragon Center" folder. This folder is writable by any authenticated local user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The ACLs on the "C:\ProgramData\MSI\Dragon Center" directory allow any authenticated local user to write to this directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can overwrite system files (or files used by the application), leading to escalated privileges.
*   **Bypassing Controls:** An attacker can bypass controls to change software settings (e.g., Battery Master settings) that they wouldn't normally have access to.
*  **Malware Execution:** An attacker can place malicious binaries in the same directory and manipulate application configuration files such as Apps.json to execute their planted malware.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine.
*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have a valid local user account on the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   A standard local user account.
*   Ability to write to the "C:\ProgramData\MSI\Dragon Center" directory.

**Attack Scenarios (Detailed in content):**
*   **Normal Attack Scenario to Bypass Control:**
    *   The attacker manipulates files within "C:\ProgramData\MSI\Dragon Center" to modify application settings (e.g., battery master settings via `BatteryMaster.txt` or 'Recommended Apps' via `Apps.json`).
    *  An attacker can replace the legitimate application binary paths with a malware path inside the `Apps.json` file and use the same icon as the legitimate application to make it look more legitimate.
*   **Advanced Attack Scenario for EOP:**
    *   The attacker uses symbolic links and mounts to create a situation where when the administrator changes battery settings via dragon center, the writes happen to an arbitrary location, potentially overwriting a critical dll file such as `C:\Windows\System32\protected.dll`.
