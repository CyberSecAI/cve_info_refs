Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Network File System (NFS) dissector within Wireshark. Specifically, the dissector did not properly handle directory structures with cycles (loops), which resulted in excessive recursion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Recursion:** The primary weakness is the lack of a mechanism to detect or prevent infinite recursion when encountering cyclical directory graphs.
- **NFS Dissector:** The vulnerability is located within the NFS dissector component of Wireshark.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The excessive recursion triggered by a malformed NFS packet or capture file leads to a crash of the Wireshark application. This results in a denial of service, preventing users from analyzing network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Packet Injection:** An attacker could inject specially crafted NFS packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker could create a malicious packet capture file (pcap) containing malformed NFS traffic and trick a user into opening it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access (for packet injection):** An attacker would require the ability to inject network traffic on a network that is being monitored by a vulnerable Wireshark instance.
- **Social Engineering (for malicious capture files):** An attacker could rely on social engineering to trick a user into opening a malicious pcap file.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing a fix in `epan/dissectors/packet-nfs.c` that prevents excessive recursion.
- The issue affects Wireshark versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.3, 3.0.0 to 3.0.10, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.16.
- Fixed versions include 3.2.4, 3.0.11, and 2.6.17.
- The vulnerability is also referred to as `wnpa-sec-2020-08`.
