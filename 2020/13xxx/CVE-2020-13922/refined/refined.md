```
Root cause of vulnerability:
An ordinary user, under any tenant, can override another user's password through the API interface `/dolphinscheduler/users/update`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Inadequate access control: The API endpoint `/dolphinscheduler/users/update` lacks proper authorization checks, allowing ordinary users to modify other user's passwords.
- Privilege escalation: By exploiting the vulnerability, a low-privileged user can potentially gain access to other user accounts including administrative accounts

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can gain admin permission in the DolphinScheduler system.
- Unauthorized password changes for any user can be performed.
- Full control of the DolphinScheduler system can potentially be achieved by gaining admin access.

Attack vectors:
-  An attacker can send a crafted API request to the `/dolphinscheduler/users/update` endpoint.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be an ordinary user within any tenant.
- The attacker must be able to access the API.
