Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to improper error handling within the JerryScript parser, specifically when dealing with out-of-memory (OOM) conditions or other lexer errors during the scanning process. The issue manifests in two ways: a NULL dereference and a failed assertion.

*   **NULL Dereference (Issue #3786):**  A crafted JavaScript program could lead to a NULL pointer dereference in the `scanner_reverse_info_list` function, specifically when accessing `scanner_info_p->type`. The root of the problem is a scanner info list is not properly handled when the scanner fails to parse part of the input.
*   **Assertion Failure (Issue #3788):** The `scanner_scan_all` function fails an assertion (`context_p->error == PARSER_ERR_NO_ERROR`) when a parsing error occurs. It indicates that the scanner context is not being properly reset when it encounters non-OOM error during scanning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The `scanner_reverse_info_list` function doesn't check if `scanner_info_p` is valid before accessing its `type` member, which results in a crash when `scanner_info_p` is `NULL`.
*   **Improper Error Handling:**  The scanner is not properly handling parsing errors (non-OOM errors). When the scanner encounters an error other than OOM, it does not correctly reset the context, leading to the assertion failure later.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:**  Both issues result in a crash of the JerryScript interpreter, leading to a denial of service. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to crash applications or devices using JerryScript, disrupting functionality.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although not directly stated in the provided content, a crash can sometimes be a stepping stone for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JavaScript:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by providing specific, crafted JavaScript code as input to the JerryScript engine. The code manipulates the engine's state in a way that exposes the improper error handling of the scanner, leading to the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted JavaScript code to the JerryScript interpreter. This could be done through a web application, a local script execution, or any other mechanism that allows the execution of JavaScript code within the context of a JerryScript environment.

**Additional Notes:**
* The commit `69f8e78c2f8d562bd6d8002b5488f1662ac30d24` addresses both vulnerabilities by fixing the error handling in the scanner, particularly in the case of OOM or other parsing failures.
* The fix involves properly freeing resources (literal pools) and resetting the scanner context when an error occurs.

In summary, the provided issues relate to vulnerabilities in JerryScript's parsing/scanning logic, triggered by specific crafted Javascript which result in a crash of the interpreter. The fix ensures resources are freed and context reset when error occurs.
