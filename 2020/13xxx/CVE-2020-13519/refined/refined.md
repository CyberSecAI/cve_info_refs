- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WinRing0x64 driver, used by NZXT CAM software, allows a low-privilege user to directly access the `writemsr` instruction without any restrictions via IRP 0x9c402088.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper privilege management (CWE-269)
    - Unrestricted access to the `writemsr` instruction which allows writing to any Model Specific Register (MSR) on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate privileges by writing to arbitrary MSRs. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious I/O request packet (IRP) sent to the vulnerable driver `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privilege user on the system with the ability to send IOCTL requests to the driver.
