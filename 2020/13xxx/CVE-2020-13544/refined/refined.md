- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A sign extension vulnerability exists in the TextMaker document parsing functionality of SoftMaker Office 2021's TextMaker application. Specifically, a 16-bit size field read from a record in the document's index table is treated as an unsigned value when calculating the size of a heap allocation, but later treated as a signed value when used as an index into that allocation during a loop, leading to out-of-bounds writes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **CWE-194 - Unexpected Sign Extension**: The core issue is that a 16-bit value is sign-extended where it shouldn't be, leading to unexpected behavior.
    - **Heap-based buffer overflow**: Due to the incorrect index calculation, the loop writes outside the allocated heap buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Memory corruption**: Arbitrary memory locations on the heap can be overwritten.
    - **Potential code execution**: The controlled heap corruption can lead to code execution within the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A specially crafted TextMaker document (`.tmd` file) is used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the crafted document with SoftMaker Office TextMaker.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the handling of record type `0x001f` in the TextMaker document parsing process.
- The size field from the index table record is used to allocate a heap buffer, but the same size is used with a sign extension to calculate an offset into that buffer.
- If the most significant bit is set in the 16bit size, the index becomes a negative value due to sign extension.
- This leads to writing data before the allocated buffer, corrupting heap metadata, and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the loop that reads data from the file into the allocated heap buffer.
- The code execution occurs within the context of the application.
