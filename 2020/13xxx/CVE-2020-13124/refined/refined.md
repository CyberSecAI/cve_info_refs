Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `isFAT()` function in `checkdir.py` within SABnzbd did not properly validate user-supplied input. Specifically, the "Completed Download Folder" settings were not sufficiently sanitized.
- Similar issues were found in the "Nice and IONice Parameters" settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of input provided through the SABnzbd web interface settings. This allows specially crafted input to be passed to underlying system calls without sufficient sanitization.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The lack of input validation leads to the potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the same privileges as the SABnzbd process.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the SABnzbd process, an attacker could potentially gain control over the system, leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface Access:** Exploitation requires access to the SABnzbd web interface. This interface is typically accessible on `localhost` by default without any authentication.
- **Malicious Settings Input:** Attackers can inject malicious code via specially crafted "Completed Download Folder" or "Nice and IONice Parameters" settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the SABnzbd web interface.
- **Web Interface Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify SABnzbd's configuration settings.
- **No authentication or vulnerable authentication:** This vulnerability is most easily exploitable when the SABnzbd web interface is accessible without a username and password which is the default configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Operating System:** The vulnerability affects non-Windows operating systems. Windows installations are not affected.
- **Config Lock:** Setups using the `config_lock` option are not vulnerable.
- **Authentication:** Setting a username and password for the web interface prevents unauthorized access and therefore mitigates the risk.
- **Affected Versions:** Versions 2.0.0RC1 to 2.3.9 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.0Beta4 and later versions.
