Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the gSOAP WS-Security plugin, specifically when processing XML namespaces within a RequestSecurityToken request. The code doesn't validate if a namespace value exists before pushing the namespace which leads to a crash

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to use a pointer that is null, leading to a crash.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not check if a value is provided for the namespace before attempting to use it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service condition, causing the affected service to crash and become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to a service using the gSOAP library.
- Specifically, the crafted request needs to include an XML namespace declaration with a null value, within a RequestSecurityToken request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.
- **Knowledge of the SOAP/XML Structure:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific SOAP request with a malformed namespace declaration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `soap_push_ns` function within the `stdsoap2.c` file and `soap_attribute` function.
- The provided crash information confirms the null pointer dereference and the affected functions.
- The vulnerability affects gSOAP version 2.8.107 (as per Talos report).
- Patches have been released to fix this issue (as indicated in the Fedora and Debian updates).
- The provided code snippet highlights the vulnerable line `(void)soap_push_ns(soap, name + 5 + (name[5] == ':'), value, 0, 0);` where value is not checked for null before usage.
