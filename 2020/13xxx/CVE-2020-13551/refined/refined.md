Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is incorrect default file system permissions on the PostgreSQL installation directory within Advantech WebAccess/SCADA. Specifically, the `pg_ctl.exe` executable and related DLLs have weak permissions allowing any authenticated user to modify them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file system permissions on the PostgreSQL binaries and libraries.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** This allows a local attacker to replace legitimate binaries/libraries with malicious ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution as NT SYSTEM:** By replacing the legitimate executables or libraries, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the NT SYSTEM user, the highest privilege level on a Windows system. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Advantech WebAccess/SCADA is installed.
*   **File Replacement:** The attack involves replacing the legitimate `pg_ctl.exe` or related DLLs located in `C:\postgresql\postgresql\bin\` with a malicious executable/DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Windows system.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker requires the ability to write to the `C:\postgresql\postgresql\bin\` directory to replace the files.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Files:** The attacker must be aware of which files can be replaced to achieve code execution during service startup.
