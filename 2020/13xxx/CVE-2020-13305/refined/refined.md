Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user is removed from a private project in GitLab, any pending invitations they had sent out to new members are not automatically revoked or invalidated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrevoked Invitations:** The core issue is that pending invitations remain active even after the user who initiated them is removed from the project.
*   **Email Alias Exploitation**: The vulnerability is further compounded by the fact that GitLab ignores the `+` sign in email addresses when sending invitations, meaning that an invitation sent to user+alias@example.com will also be accepted by user@example.com.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** A user who has been removed from a private project can regain access by exploiting the unrevoked invitation they sent to an alias email.
*   **Maintainer privileges**: The user could regain maintainer privileges that were previously revoked.
*   **Data Exposure:** The user could potentially access sensitive data or code within the private project, which they were intended to be restricted from.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Pending Invitation Abuse:** The attack vector involves a user sending a project invitation to an email alias they control before being removed from the project. The user can then accept this invitation even after they have been removed, regaining access to the private project.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Initial Access:** The attacker must initially be a member of the private project and have the privileges to send out invitations.
*   **Email Control:** The attacker needs to have an email alias or control of an email address to which they sent an invite from within the project.

**Additional Notes:**

* The report explicitly compares the vulnerability to GitHub's behavior where pending invitations are automatically removed when a user is removed from an organization or private project.
* The report mentions that the vulnerability was found by `rgupt` on 2019-02-07 and assigned to `dappelt`.
