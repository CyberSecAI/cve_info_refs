Based on the provided information, here's an extraction for CVE-2020-13529:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The systemd DHCP client does not implement authentication on the FORCERENEW packet, as specified in RFC 3203 section 6.1. This allows an attacker to forge FORCERENEW packets.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290). The systemd DHCP client lacks proper authentication for FORCERENEW packets.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker can reconfigure the target device's network interface by forging DHCP ACK packets, potentially disrupting network connectivity or redirecting traffic.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker on the same network can forge FORCERENEW and DHCP ACK packets to reconfigure a target device running systemd's DHCP client.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target device to sniff the Transaction ID and send spoofed packets.
*   **Affected Products (from NetApp advisory):**
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
    *   NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)
*   **Unaffected Products (from NetApp advisory):** A long list of NetApp products are listed as not affected.
*   **Remediation (NetApp):** NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) has no plans to address this vulnerability
*   **Resolution (Gentoo):** All systemd users should upgrade to the latest version (>= 248.5)

    *   `emerge --sync`
    *   `emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/systemd-248.5"`

*   **Ubuntu details:** Ubuntu applied patches for CVE-2020-13529 in Ubuntu 21.04.
*   **CVSSv3 Score:** 6.1 (Medium) CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H (NetApp)
