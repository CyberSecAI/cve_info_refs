The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in rConfig 3.9.4, including the vulnerability assigned CVE-2020-13638.

**CVE-2020-13638 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `procRegister()` function in `www/lib/crud/userprocess.php` allows a user-controlled `ulevelid` parameter to be passed directly to the `addNewUser()` function in `classes/usersession.class.php`. This allows an attacker to specify the user level (privileges) during registration, and there's no sanitization or validation of this parameter before adding it to the database.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation, specifically on the `ulevelid` parameter during user registration, results in a privilege escalation vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can register a new user account with administrative privileges (ulevelid=9). This grants the attacker full control over the rConfig application.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the user registration page (`procRegister()`). An attacker can manipulate the `ulevelid` parameter during registration.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to access the user registration functionality of the rConfig web application. No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Information from the content:**

*   The blog post also details other vulnerabilities, such as:
    *   **Type juggling** vulnerability in login and user ID confirmation. While the author doesn't believe it is exploitable, they note it as a potential issue.
    *   **Weak random number generation** using `mt_rand()` for remember-me functionality and password reset.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerabilities through unescaped variables in `www/lib/crud/search.crud.php` and other places.
    *   **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities in multiple files (`www/compliancepolicies.inc.php`, `www/compliancepolicyelements.inc.php`, `www/devices.inc.php`, `www/snippets.inc.php`) due to unsanitized user-controlled input in SQL queries. These are specifically assigned CVEs CVE-2020-10546, CVE-2020-10547, CVE-2020-10548 and CVE-2020-10549.
    *  **Privilege escalation** through editing an account to change `ulevelid` .
*   The post highlights the importance of reviewing patches, noting that the developer had attempted to fix SQLi/LFI in the `search.crud.php` file by adding an `escapeshellarg` function but it was incomplete and vulnerable to command injection.
*   The author mentions that passwords are stored as md5 hashes, which are considered deprecated and unsafe.
