- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of bounds checking in the LZW decoder while processing GIF image data. Specifically, the copy loop within the LZW decoding process does not validate if the copy index is within the bounds of the allocated buffer before writing to memory, which leads to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution due to the ability to overwrite adjacent heap memory after the overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted malicious GIF file is provided to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious GIF file to be processed by the vulnerable software.
