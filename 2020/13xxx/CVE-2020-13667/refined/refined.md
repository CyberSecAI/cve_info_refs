Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The experimental Workspaces module in Drupal does not sufficiently check access permissions when switching between workspaces.
* **Weakness:** Insufficient access control when switching workspaces.
* **Impact:** An attacker could potentially bypass access controls and view content that is not intended to be public (i.e. draft content not yet published to the live workspace).
* **Attack Vector:** An authenticated user could exploit this vulnerability by switching workspaces in a way that bypasses access checks.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Drupal site and the site must have the experimental Workspaces module installed.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is considered "Moderately critical" with an Access Complexity of "Basic," Authentication of "None" (for the vulnerability, not for access to the site), a Confidentiality Impact of "Some," Integrity Impact of "None," Exploitability of "Theoretical" and a Target Distribution of "Default".
*   The vulnerability affects Drupal versions 8.0.0 before 8.8.10, 8.9.0 before 8.9.6, and 9.0.0 before 9.0.6.
*   The advisory mentions that once a site is upgraded, authenticated users might still see previously accessed unauthorized content until they log out.
*   A workaround to force immediate prevention of unauthorized content access is to end all active user sessions, which has the side effect of logging all users out.
