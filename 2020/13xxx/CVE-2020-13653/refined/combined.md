#### ZCS 8.8.7 released

[ZCS 8.8.7](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.8.7) was released today. It includes fixes for a Persistent XSS vulnerability, [CVE-2018-6882](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6882) / [bug 108768](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108786) and Mailsploit related issues / [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

Note: We recommend that all sites **upgrading** to 8.8.7 manually set **zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress** to **FALSE** which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.

 Mar 8, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZCS 8.6.0 Patch9 released

[ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 9](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.6.0_Patch9) was released today and includes fixes for two Persistent XSS vulnerabilities, [CVE-2017-8802](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8802) / [bug 107925](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=107925) and [CVE-2017-17703](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17703) / [bug 108265](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108265).

If this patch is not applied, one potential workaround to avoid this issue is to set zimbraPrefUseKeyboardShortcuts to FALSE (for all users/classes-of-service). Note: disabling keyboard shortcuts would have the side effect of disabling all ZCS controlled keyboard shortcuts and this may impact normal user client interaction.

 Feb 9, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZWC affected by Mailsploit

All supported versions of Zimbra Web Client (ZWC) *prior to 8.8.7* are affected by [Mailsploit](https://www.mailsploit.com/). *We recommend that all sites upgrading to 8.8.7 manually set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.*

The workaround which addresses most issues is to set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE (if you are an administrator) for all users/classes-of-service. As an end user you can also control this setting by going to 'Preferences > Display names in place of email addresses when available' and deselecting the checkbox for this option (this is the end user control for the preference attribute mentioned above). This issue is being tracked as [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

At this point, no details have been provided about how any servers were compromised. Without any details, the best advice we can give is:

* Get (and stay) up to date on OS version and patches.
* Get (and stay) up to date on [ZCS](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/) version and patches.
* Ensure servers are properly firewalled (see [Ports](/wiki/Ports "Ports") and only allow access to the minimum number of services that is required to meet your business requirements.
* Review and compare your system configuration against best practices like the [CIS benchmarks](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/latest/).

#### Workaround: OpenSSL padding oracle in AES-NI CBC MAC check (CVE-2016-2107)

The [2016-05-03 announcement](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt) by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) regarding a padding oracle in the AES-NI CBC MAC check affects [supported releases](https://www.zimbra.com/support/support-offerings/product-lifecycle/) of ZCS 8.0-8.6.0 (via MTAs and Proxy).

We anticipate releasing 8.6.1 (and 8.7) with fixes for this issue, however if this issue is impacting your environment, the recommended workaround is covered in [bug 104982](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104982). NOTE: in ZCS 8.7+ we are able to easily patch third party packages included with ZCS via [package repos](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository).

First, test that you are vulnerable with the following tool:

<https://filippo.io/CVE-2016-2107/>

* Edit /opt/zimbra/.bash\_profile
  - add the following to the end of user zimbra's .bash\_profile (requires root privs):

  `# workaround CVE-2016-2107

  export OPENSSL_ia32cap="~0x200000200000000"`
* Edit sudoers - add the following line to your sudoers (/etc/sudoers or whatever is appropriate for your platform):

  `Defaults env_keep += "OPENSSL_ia32cap"`
* Configure postfix - instructs postfix to honor the desired environment variable:

  `$ zmlocalconfig -e postfix_import_environment='OPENSSL_ia32cap'`

A special thanks to Malte Stretz from our Gold Partner, [Silpion](http://www.silpion.de/), for his persistence and hard work to gather the information covered in this workaround! Also this article would be incomplete without mentioning that the original inspiration for this workaround came from <https://mjanja.ch/2013/11/disabling-aes-ni-on-linux-openssl/>.

#### In Brief: DROWN / Cross-protocol attack on TLS using SSLv2 (CVE-2016-0800)

The [2016-03-01 announcement](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160301.txt) by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) regarding [DROWN](https://drownattack.com/) via SSLv2 affects ZCS 8.0.x (via MTAs), but no other currently [supported releases](https://www.zimbra.com/support/support-offerings/product-lifecycle/). See [How to disable SSLv3](/wiki/How_to_disable_SSLv3 "How to disable SSLv3"), as it includes instructions on disabling SSLv2 and SSLv3. Additional info may also be found in [bug 104130](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104130).

#### ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 5 availability

ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 5 is available (officially released Dec 21, 2015). Patch 5 includes fixes for five (5) CVE's (ref: [Zimbra Security Advisories](/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories "Zimbra Security Advisories")). Three of the CVE-IDs referenced in the patch come via 3rd party components shipped w/ZCS. Please note, one of the fixed vulnerabilities is [rated as major](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Vulnerability_Rating_Classification). See the [blog post](https://blog.zimbra.com/2015/12/zimbra-collaboration-8-6-patch-5-now-available/) or the release notes (available from the [downloads](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/) area for additional notes on ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 5.

[Update: Feb 2, 2016]

If you can not patch immediately, the XSS bug classified as major (bug 101435) can be worked around by either disabling or uninstalling (zmzimletctl undeploy) the com\_zimbra\_url (aka URL links) zimlet.

#### OpenSSL alternative chains certificate forgery (CVE-2015-1793)

Today's announcement by OpenSSL (<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20150709.txt>) regarding alternative chains certificate forgery does not affect any Zimbra Collaboration releases.

Specifically, the latest Zimbra Collaboration 8.6 release ships with OpenSSL 1.0.1l, but this issue affects the following OpenSSL versions 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.1n and 1.0.1o only.

#### A note on Logjam

There is a lot of chatter about [Logjam - https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/) today.

At this time, the initial impacts to Collab seem to be minimal and are currently limited to the MTA, specifically possible setting changes, depending upon your environment.

Today we updated the [MTA Ciphers](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86#Ciphers_4) section of our Collab 8.6 security wiki page. In short, for anyone concerned about the Logjam (cipher downgrade) style of MitM attacks, the use of 'export' and 'low' ciphers in Postfix should be avoided. Please note that Postfix, by default (<http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_ciphers>) allows use of lower ciphers. Changing these to 'medium' can reduce client interoperability and/or may cause some clients to fall back to in the clear communication channels instead of using lower grade encryption.

As usual, there are trade-offs involved, but in the light of FREAK ([https://freakattack.com](https://freakattack.com/)) and Logjam ([https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/)) attacks, it may also be argued that using ciphers lower than 'medium' is now potentially providing an illusion of security. With this in mind, our current recommendation is to avoid both 'export' and 'low' ciphers with the hope that complete deprecation of these ciphers will be coming soon.

Please visit <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86> to keep up with our latest recommendations. Also, for those looking to strengthen their security posture, in Collab 8.7 we have a number of enhancements slated including the ability to strengthen **[DH params](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=98852)**. A sneak preview of security related changes/enhancements in the works is available at <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/87>.

Lastly, for those with openssl 1.0.2 available, you may find this post from OpenSSL useful <https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/>

Update for 8.0.x customers: In Collab 8.0.x, Java 1.7 is used. Unfortunately, in Java 1.7, the DH parameters are hard-coded to 768 bits (excluding when using export cipher suites, which use 512 bits, but those should already be disabled). The workaround is to use the (Nginx) Proxy always. The other option is to disable all DHE suites. Which has the side effect of losing forward secrecy for any user agents that do not support ECDHE.

#### What the FREAK attack means to Zimbra

Zimbra is aware of a newly disclosed SSL/TLS vulnerability that provides a potential malicious actor with a method to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack the vulnerability is being referred to as FREAK (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), utilizing [CVE-2015-0204](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0204).

The attack allows a malicious actor to force a downgrade of a secure connection to a vulnerable, export grade encryption (READ: weak encryption). Which, [according to Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/03/freak-flaw-undermines-security-for-apple-and-google-users-researchers-discover/), is downgraded to 512-bit encryption that was the maximum allowed under the export controls in place during the 1990s in the U.S. The Washington Post piece goes on to say it is possible to crack 512-bit encryption, today, in approximately 7 hours with the use of 75 computers, which can be rented from a cloud computing provider for approximately $100.

[Matthew Green](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/03/attack-of-week-freak-or-factoring-nsa.html), cryptographer and research professor from Johns Hopkins, provided a Cliffs Notes version:

A group of cryptographers at INRIA, Microsoft Research and IMDEA have discovered some serious vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (e.g., Android) clients and Apple TLS/SSL clients (e.g., Safari) that allow a 'man in the middle attacker' to downgrade connections from 'strong' RSA to 'export-grade' RSA. These attacks are real and exploitable against a shocking number of websites -- including government websites. Patch soon and be careful.

In addition to Matthew Green's post and the Washington Post article, the [freakattack.com](http://freakattack.com/) site has additional information, including a list of the top domains still vulnerable, as well as a built in check of the browser used to surf to the site.

#### Zimbra Specifics

Zimbra ships with the OpenSSL library. At this time, Zimbra has assessed Zimbra Collaboration 8.x, 7.x and found no susceptibility to the FREAK attack in the servers. As there is a client side component to this attack, please verify that you are running the latest browsers/clients to lower the risk to this type of attack.

As part of our security program, Zimbra will continue to monitor all developments related to the FREAK vulnerability and update this post as needed.

#### GNU C Library Vulnerability — aka GHOST

Zimbra is aware of a Linux vulnerability, specifically the GNU C Library.

**Details**

The vulnerability appears to have been found by [Qualys](https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability) and disclosed in security advisory [CVE 2015-0235](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235). It should be noted that the vulnerability was patched in v 2.17 of the library, but at the time was not categorized as a security issue, leading many to maintain stable versions, i.e. vulnerable versions. This is an operating system vulnerability; at this time, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no known exploits against Zimbra's software related to CVE 2015-0235.

**\*\*Recommendation\*\***

Zimbra recommends that anyone running Linux update their systems as soon as possible. And while Linux doesn't usually require a restart, it is recommended to ensure all underlying software services are patched.

**Patches or acknowledgements**

#### POODLE Revisited

We have received a few inquiries about the reported TLS protocol vulnerability via the POODLE attack. SSL/TLS services in ZCS come from OpenSSL and Java. This vulnerability does not affect OpenSSL (ref: [http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users@openssl.org/msg75804.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users%40openssl.org/msg75804.html)) and Java is not known to be affected.

#### Security Advisory: Zimbra Community 8.x Security Vulnerability

Security is top of mind for everyone here at Zimbra, which is why we want to inform you that our team just discovered a security vulnerability in Zimbra Community 8.0 (formerly Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise). The vulnerability is relegated to a very specific scenario in which a user within Zimbra Community 8.0 is able to view a user password via a specific API call.

**Summary:** The Zimbra development team has identified a very specific scenario where a user’s password in Community 8 is stored insecurely.

**Affected Versions:** 8.0.0.37997 (unpatched), 8.0.1.39116

**Vulnerability Scoring:** CVSS: 1.4

**Obtaining a fix:** <http://telligent.com/support/m/support/1354746.aspx>

**Details:** The administrative feature to create users leverages non-public APIs that can force a user’s password to be inadvertently stored insecurely.

**Reporter:** Alex Crome (Zimbra)

**When does this occur?**

1. Creating a user through the control panel using Membership Administration (requires administrative privileges)

2. Could occur if a custom plugin was deployed that copied off the extended attributes on a create user event and in turn re-saved those attributes using the UpdateUser API (this is unlikely, but possible)

If you have any questions or would like assistance with applying the patch, please contact support.

This advisory was originally [published here](http://blog.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2014/06/community-8-x-critical-security-vulnerability.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zimbra+%28Zimbra+%3A%3A+Blog%29).

#### Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)

**20140606: Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)**

On June 5, 2014 the OpenSSL project released a [security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt). [CVE-2014-0224](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0224) can allow for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to be carried out between a vulnerable client and vulnerable server. It is also important to note that Zimbra does not use DTLS nor do we have SSL\_MODE\_RELEASE\_BUFFERS enabled.

The impact to Zimbra Collaboration Server is as follows:

* ZCS 6 is not affected
* ZCS 7 is not affected
* ZCS 8 is affected

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable.

If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>). Please upgrade to a newer version first, then run this patch.

Zimbra has produced a patch for OpenSSL vulnerabily for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

The following patch instructions must be done on a per server basis:

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol stop

```

* As root:

```
cd /tmp
wget http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh
chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
./zmopenssl-updater.sh

```

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol start

```

After a successful patch, ZCS 8.0.7 will be running 1.0.1h. To verify this, run the following as zimbra user:

```
openssl version

```

On an 8.0.7 patched system the result should be:

```
zimbra$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1h 5 Jun 2014

```

Earlier versions of ZCS will show other versions of OpenSSL - Zimbra patches the existing OpenSSL version appropriate to each ZCS version.

Continue to the next server and repeat the patch process.

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries. It only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra.

#### Critical Security Advisory and Builds/Patches for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability

**Overview**

Zimbra Collaboration Server 8 is susceptible to the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug:

* <http://heartbleed.com>
* <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt>
* <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160>

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link directly to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable. Only OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later are reported as being vulnerable.

Zimbra has produced an OpenSSL patch for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>), so you would please need to upgrade to a secure version first, then run this patch.

The patch is located here:

* <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>

The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Please note: this vulnerability is being reported as having existed and actively attacked since 2012. As such, the private SSL keys for your platform may already have been compromised. After patching, it is recommended to regenerate your SSL certificates and private keys. This is unfortunate, but the only way to ensure that an attacker cannot decrypt your SSL session data.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue if running OpenSSL 1.0.1. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries - it only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra. For example:

* RHEL6\_64 and UBUNTU12\_64 both use OpenSSL 1.0.1 at the OS level and are affected
* SLES11\_64 and UBUNTU10\_64 use OpenSSL 0.9.8 at the OS level, so are not affected

### Patching

The steps to patch are the following:

(as root)
1) wget <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>
2) chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
3) ./zmopenssl-updater.sh

### Zimbra Collaboration 8.0.7 Builds

Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.0.7 - both the Network Edition and Open-Source Edition - have been rebuilt to include the fix for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability.

If you haven't yet upgraded to 8.0.7, the current versions up on the Download site now disable TLS Heartbeat and protect against the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability:

* Network Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-network.html>
* Open-Source Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-opensource.html>

In short:

* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 prior to Thursday, April 10, then your version DOES NOT include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6020 -> **Vulnerable, you would still need the OpenSSL patch**: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/70921-critical-security-advisory-patch-openssl-heartbleed-vulnerability.html>
* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 Thursday, April 10 or after, then your version DOES include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6021 -> **Not Vulnerable, no patch required**

### OpenSSL Patch Update for ZCS 8.0.3 Only

If you patched for the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability for Zimbra Collaboration Server 8.0.3 prior to Wed April 09, 2014, 11:00 Eastern/08:00 Pacific, you will need to re-patch.

Please note: this is ONLY for ZCS 8.0.3. All other patches were fine, but the 8.0.3 openssl builds were still vulnerable. Repeating, this is only for ZCS 8.0.3.

Here is how you can check your build version:
$ zmcontrol -v
(look for "8.0.3")

Please use the test methods below to confirm.

### Testing

There are a few ways you can confirm if your system is vulnerable:

1. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check your version tarball for the build number 6021. For example:

* [http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7\_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64.20140408123937.tgz](http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7_GA_6021.RHEL6_64.20140408123937.tgz) - the build number here is "6021"

2. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check zmcontrol for the build number:

# su - zimbra
$ zmcontrol -v
Release 8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64\_20140408123937 RHEL6\_64 NETWORK edition.

3. If running any version of Zimbra Collaboration, check if the libssl shared library is built with dlts1\_heartbeat:

**Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
dtls1\_heartbeat
$

**Not Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
$

Please let Zimbra know promptly if any problems or questions.

#### Urgency on Security Fixes for Bug 80338 and Bug 84547

Bug 80338 (Feb 2013) is a Local File Inclusion vulnerability that leads to potential Privilege Escalation

* Bug 80338: Privilege Escalation via LFI
* CVE: <https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7091>
* Affected versions: 7.2.2 and 8.0.2 and all previous releases

Bug 84547 is a XXE Vulnerability which, among other things, could be abused to disclose information from local files (Dec 2013):

* Bug 84547: XXE (CWE-611)
* CVE: <https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7217>
* Affected Versions: releases before 7.2.6 in the 7 series, and 8.0.6 in the 8.0 series

There is great urgency for getting this patched on your platform, as there is an exploit for Bug 80338 in the wild, discussed here:

* [Security Guidance for reported "0day Exploit"](http://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/67236-security-guidance-reported-0day-exploit.html)
* <http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/30085/>

And it has been used to install upload rogue Zimlets and bitcoin mining processes (and potentially others) on some customer systems. You can read about the clean-up steps for this here:

* <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Investigating_and_Securing_Systems>

As noted, there are patches and upgrades available here:

* <http://info.zimbra.com/zimbra-news-new-patch-release-new-training-courses-and-upcoming-events>

## What's New

**NOTE:** Beta features are not supported and should not be installed on production systems. Beta modules have been provided for evaluation in lab environments only.

**RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) 8 support (Beta)**

We are nearing the end of our extensive QA cycle for this major upgrade. Watch for the GA announcement in an upcoming patch release.

Check [RHEL Upgraded Packages](#RHEL_Upgraded_Packages) for previous and current versions of included packages.

### Zimbra Classic Web Client (ZWC)

* The login screen that external users engage to authenticate for resource sharing has been updated to visually match the Modern login screen.

### Zimbra Connector for Outlook

* **Zimbra Free/Busy Provider** is now Generally Available. Refer to the Admin Guide for operation details.
* When creating a new Rule (aka Zimbra Filter) using ZCO, the user is given the option to run it immediately.

### Zimbra Connect

* Previously the loss of the WebSocket connection would cause the loss of all pending messages; now the Zimlet retries to send the pending messages every 10 seconds.
* **Additional Language support** (Beta) - Zimbra Connect has added support for: French, Japanese, and Dutch locales.
* The screen share feature has been rewritten so that it no longer requires the chrome plugin and is available on the Modern Web App.

### Modern Web App

Briefcase

Briefcase feature (beta) in Modern Web App currently supports the following features:

* + Upload files to briefcase
  + Download files from the briefcase
  + Delete files in the briefcase
  + Add an attachment to an email, from briefcase
  + Save an email attachment, to briefcase

... and many more on the way!

Zimlets

* Zimlets now carry a user-friendly display name.
* User feedback zimlet is now present as an optional zimlet for Users. When this zimlet is enabled, end users can send direct feedback about Modern UI to the Zimbra 9 product team. To access this zimlet click on the Settings icon in the Modern Web App.
* The Zimlets section of the Admin Guide is updated to cover the changes from 8.8.15, which are specific to Zimlets for the Modern Web App.
* To enhance events' management, declined events appear with a strike-through in users' calendars. Users can choose to view or hide declined events based on the setting under Calendar and Reminders->Declined Events.

Earlier, declined events were removed from the calendar altogether.

* **Propose new time:** Event invitees can now respond to the organizer with a proposed new time for the event, which the organizer can choose to [Accept] or [Decline]. If organizers accept the change, the event's edit screen helps them edit the event or series before sending the updated event to all invitees.
* The app now allows movement of subfolders to any of the system or user-created folders using the drag and drop.
* Translations for supported languages have been updated for several new features.
* When users compose a new message, it opens in a new tab. This feature gives greater flexibility when navigating between various verticals and managing drafts.
* Modern web app now supports more languages -- Polish, Russian, Dutch, Portuguese, Korean, and Traditional Chinese for Hong Kong and Taiwan. Please note that this is currently a beta feature as machine translations have been used for these languages. These will be refined in future patches.
* "Trusted Addresses and Domains" setting has been added under, "Viewing Emails". This setting gives users the flexibility to decide the specified addresses or domains which can be trusted to display images by default.
* Following changes have been made in Settings to improve the user experience:
  + Moved **Display Images** from **Security and Activity** section to **Viewing Emails**.
  + **Security and Activity** tab will only be enabled when user-sessions-management zimlet is enabled for the Users.
* New email notifications are more informative, and carry the sender's name, email subject, and some part of the email body (when display space is available in the notification).
* In **Settings** > **Writing Email**, users can now choose *Right to Left* as a compose direction for writing emails.
* Users can now search various file types using advanced search filters options.
  + Please note that the Sheet, Slides, and Compressed categories do not include the following file types:
    - Sheet = .ots, .ods
    - Slides = .csv, .otp, .odp, .potx, .potm
    - Compressed = .tar, .rar, .tgz, .jar
* In Settings -> Writing Email -> Composer, users can now set default preferences for Font, Font Size, and colors for composing an email.
* Earlier, if senders had set a persona with a different Reply-to address, receivers' preview pane did not display it; and replies did not go to that Reply-to email address specified in the persona. Now, the Reply-to address defined in senders' persona appears correctly for receivers and senders receive the replies to this address.

### NG Modules

* New drive blobs will now honor NG HSM compression settings.
* Basic bucket management commands are now available from the command line. (`docreatebucket`, `listbuckets`, `doupdatebucket`, and `dodeletebucket`)
* The `mailboxmove` notification e-mail sent to the admin now lists also the accounts that were not moved.
* Like `doCheckBlobs`, these commands now return the monitor command when run:
  + `doAccountScan`
  + `DoCheckShares`
  + `DoCoherencyCheck`
  + `DoExternalRestore`
  + `DoCheckBlobs`
  + `DoDeduplicate`
  + `DoMoveBlobs`
  + `DoVolumeToVolumeMove`
  + `DoPurgeMailboxes`
  + `DoRemoveOrphanedBlobs`
  + Improved the Email sent to the admin after a `doPurgeMailboxes` command, to list detailed information for each purged mailbox.
* Improved output when a `doRestoreOnNewAccount` failed because backup data was not available on the current server for the source account.
* The `zimbraFeatureTaskEnabled` at COS/Account level now defines whether Tasks are synchronized via EAS.
* The Docs server software has been upgraded to align with CODE 4.2. "This release includes a fresh look, ...improved inter-operability, new dialogs, and functionality as well as a raft of bug fixes and polish." Read more on [collaboraoffice.com](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code-4-2-0-release).
* A scroll bar has been added to make file browsing easier for public users when accessing a Drive share with a lot of files.
* **Additional Language support** (Beta) - Zimbra Drive has added support for: French, Japanese, and Dutch locales.

## Fixed Issues

### Zimbra Collaboration

* Meeting invites, created in Outlook (Mac), sent to external participants can now be imported into Mac Calendar or Thunderbird/Lightning without errors.

### Zimbra Connector for Outlook

* Fixed a day-1 issue that caused Outlook to crash when creating a Zimbra profile with a name containing extended Unicode characters.
* Fixed some minor cosmetic problems in the Rules wizard.

### Modern Web App

* The tab bar, which contains Mail, Contact, and Calendar tabs, now has a border demarcating it from the rest of the interface.
* When creating events the web app displayed a font named "Undefined" under font options. After this fix, font options display proper names for all available fonts.
* Users could not snooze or dismiss event notifications from shared calendars. They received the error - "Permission denied". After this fix, users can dismiss shared calendars' event notifications without errors.
* When Users hover over labels on Contact actions, information for that action is displayed.
* When users tried to archive an email, error toast message "There was a problem creating the archive folder" was displayed and the archive failed. After this fix, users can now archive emails successfully.
* Users can now launch the composer by clicking `mailto:` links in the Contact hovercard. Earlier, this action displayed a 404 error.
* RSVP action buttons no longer appear on canceled event notification emails.
* When users right-click an already read email, the option "Mark as Read" no longer appears.
* In the Contacts tab, whenever users selected a contact to view it in a resized screen or a smaller Contacts pane, the contact's information did not adjust to the available space. After this fix, the contact information adjusts to the available space without obscuring any information.
* Users can now move emails from the search list or tag folder to other folders using Drag and Drop.

### NG Changelog

* Fixed some minor graphical issues with drive's upload button (hover rule not working, bottom border)
* Fixed a bug that could cause zip file corruption when downloading a large directory from Drive.
* Fixed an issue where closing a PDF file took a lot of time and it kept buffering.
* Recipients can now open a shared drive link.
* Fixed an issue that prevented a delegated admin from setting migration to ng (`zxsuite admin doMigrateAdmin`) if a different delegated admin had been deleted only from ldap (e.g. by `zmprov -l da #adminaccount`).
* Fixed a bug that could cause a file descriptor leak when running any operation that moved blobs between volumes with the same compression settings targeting a volume with a large number of files.
* When encountering a metadata file without a digest value, the backup purge will now simply log an error at debug level and proceed.
* Running the doCoherencyCheck operation with the fixBackup option now also fixes "CoS not found" errors that may happen after a migration.
* When restoring dynamic distribution lists from a backup, Zimbra ids of old items were not replaced with the new ids. Now ids are correctly updated on restoring the lists.
* Fixed the output of the command `zxsuite mobile getdeviceinfo #account #deviceid` that mismatched values and descriptions (language was displayed under os, for example).
* Fixed a date parsing error that made it impossible to search for messages before/after specific dates when the language was set to Hungarian.
* Fixed a bug that caused the Modern Web App to fail loading when some User Preferences or System Limitations (e.g., `zimbraFileUploadMaxSize`) were configured to be larger than a 32-bit integer (2,147,483,647).
* Improved tab handling logic so that the cursor’s position in the document is maintained after switching away from and then back to the document editing tab.
* Fixed a problem with string encoding/decoding while sending DB rows during `doMailboxMove` that would cause the operation to fail on some mailboxes.

### Zimbra Connect

* Group members could chat amongst themselves but could not join a video call. This issue is now fixed.
* Fixed a bug the caused Instant Meeting chat message timestamps to be always in UTC instead of following the client’s settings.
* Instant Meeting invite emails are now sent to all participants, including internal users.
* Fixed a bug that caused the icon in the invitation email to disappear and show only a grey square.

### NG Admin

* To avoid the unwanted/unauthorized activation of paid features, delegated Admins are now unable to change the status of features like EWS, MAPI, and Archiving even when the "Edit Features" flag is enabled in their administrative rights.
* **Reminder:** During installation, upgrade, and periodically while in use, the ZCS server transmits information for reconciliation of billing and license data. Notices about this have been added to the Admin Guide and Installation Guides.

## Known Issues

* When users select draft emails individually, the delete icon in the preview pane becomes unavailable.
* Zimbra Collaboration on RHEL 8 (beta), **Monitor** -> **Server Status** shows all the services as stopped even when the services are running on the server.

Please refer to the steps below to install 9.0.0 Patch 2 on [Redhat](#Redhat) and [Ubuntu](#Ubuntu) platforms:

## Before Installing the Patch

Before installing the patch, consider the following:

* Patches are cumulative.
* A full backup should be performed before any patch is applied. There is no automated roll-back.
* Zimlet patches can include removing existing Zimlets and redeploying the patched Zimlet.
* Only files or Zimlets associated with installed packages will be installed from the patch.
* Switch to `zimbra` user before using ZCS CLI commands.

**Important** You cannot revert to the previous ZCS release after you upgrade to the patch. Customers who have set up local ZCS repository should first update the local repository by following instructions in [wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository#Keep_the_local_Repository_up_to_date).

* Please make note that, installing the `zimbra-patch` package only updates the Zimbra core packages.

## Security Fixes

| Summary | CVE-ID | CVSS Score | Zimbra Rating | Fix Patch Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities | [CVE-2020-13653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13653) | 4.3 | Minor | 8.8.15 P11 |

## What's New

Zimbra 8.8.15 is now fully supported on RHEL 8 (GA)

Download the latest RHEL 8 binaries from <https://www.zimbra.com/downloads>

### ZCO

* Inline images in meeting notes now sync to Zimbra and are encoded to appear as inline images in the Zimbra Web Apps, instead of being attachments.

### Zimbra Connect

* Zimbra Connect has added UI support for: Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Indonesian, Thai, and Hindi languages.

### Zimbra Drive

* Zimbra Drive has added UI support for: Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Indonesian, Thai, and Hindi languages.

## Fixed Issues

### Platform

* The option to "Save a copy of sent messages to my Sent folder" that was set when granting "Send-as" delegate rights conflicted with Persona settings. This has been fixed to ensure messages sent by a delegate using a Persona do get saved in the delegator's Sent folder.
* Zimbra Collaboration on RHEL 8, **Monitor** > **Server** Status now no longer shows the running services as stopped.
* Fixed Null pointer exception encountered while sending mail using data source created without an email address.
* Fixed permission denied error while sending email to Distribution Lists from user having **Send As** rights.
  **Note:** Fixed above two issues in updated Patch version today dated July 03, 2020 which were reported on first version of 8.8.15 Patch 11.

### ZCO

* Users who have been delegated calendar management responsibilities for Resource accounts were unable to respond to invitations for those resources, and received an error message like *"Cannot open Calendar folder for user <user>. Cannot open the mailbox for this user because the user does not have a server mailbox."* They are now able to complete these actions.
* Signatures containing external images (URL references) had those images added as attachments to messages. Such messages would appear in "has:attachment" searches when the only attachment was the signature image.
  Users now have an advanced option, "Signature pictures sent as attachments" to control this behavior. When disabled, the image URL will be used without an additional attachment, thereby reducing the size of the message.
* Fixed an internationalization problem with the mailbox rules "Run Now" feature, that caused an error message if the language was set using a Language Interface pack instead of the language options in the advanced settings.

### Zimbra Connect

* User interactions have been improved. Users can now silence other participants, disable other participants' video. Disabled streams appear with an icon.
* Fixed an issue that would show all external participants of an instant meeting as offline. External participants are now shown as guests.
* Users can now choose if they want to activate the webcam, the microphone, or both before joining a meeting.
  + Users are no longer required to have both a webcam and a microphone to start an audio call.
* When a meeting host has left a meeting and attempts to start another one, they are now notified if their previous call still has attendees on line. The host may choose to return to that call, or terminate it to start their new one.
* Added GAL searches when an internal user is sending invitations for an existing instant meeting.
* Minichat size is increased and the header is rebuilt.
* Improved instant messaging message text area so that it extends to up to half of the screen height and the emoji panel does not cover it.
* Added translations for Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch locale.
* Now pictures can be set as an icon in Connect groups to identify them more easily.
  + Profile pictures are always centered and not tiled.
* Graphical restyling: The look of conversations is more clear, space is better used, and users can see more messages without scrolling.

### Zimbra Docs

* Docs is now able to open a specific version of the file from Drive.
* Improved tab handling logic so that the cursor’s position in the document is maintained after switching away from and then back to the document editing tab.
* Editing documents from the briefcase, if the default domain is not set, has been fixed.

### Zimbra Drive

* Added translations for
  + Portuguese
  + French
  + German
  + Italian
  + Spanish
  + Dutch
  + Japanese
  + Simplified Chinese
  + Indonesian
  + Thai
  + Hindi
    Notes: Translations are still in beta. Admin Console translations are planned for the next release.
* Drive now implements file version handling.
* Users can now add multiple files from their drive to their emails. Earlier, they had to add each file individually.
* If a user tries to create a new share to an external email address in Drive, now a popup with an error message is shown instead of the full stack trace.
* Edit with docs menu entry in drive was missing an icon from both the context menu and info panel.
* Improved scrollbar management when enabling/disabling the infopanel in drive.
* Fixed an issue that would display only the first 30 results when searching drive items while the browser zoom setting is close to 70%

### HSM

* The `doCheckBlobs` command resets the list of checked files after each mailbox check, to reduce memory usage.
* Administrators can now choose a target volume when using the command `mailboxmove` to move mail and drive items.
* Continue with another policy when an HSM policy’s destination volume has reached the space threshold.
* `doMoveBlobs` now checks if a secondary store is set before executing the `doMoveBlobs` operation and returns the error `Secondary store not set` when not set.
* Dumpster items during mailbox move operations are now verified for missing blobs.
* Fixed a description mismatch for s3 bucket region between command line and web admin interface.
* In `doCheckBlobs` operations, setting `check_digests` and `fix_incorrect_compressed_digests` to `true` verifies if a blob has been compressed twice and fixes that.
* Improved `doCheckBlobs` command output so that an account is listed only once.

### Infrastructure

* Ensure legacy backup is disabled when NG Backup is initialized.

### NG Backup

* Now the external restore can restore all the contacts groups in the accounts even if the restore operation is interrupted before all the accounts have been scanned.
* Smart Scan now performs backup and coherency checks to determine if a missing blob is found in the backup while HSM service is disabled.
* The command `zxsuite backup doRestoreBlobs` now checks if the volume id is valid and returns an error if the check fails.
* Added account id reference in `undelete` log lines in `mailbox.log` to simplify the debug operations.
* Allow only external restore operations to recover accounts that do not belong to any domain present on this host.
* Improved `doCoherencyCheck` memory management, so it keeps only the exception message instead of the complete stack trace.

### NG Mobile

* Implemented anti-DOS service for mobile devices. Number of requests is counted within a time window, and if exceeded device is jailed for a specified duration.
* The user’s last login in LDAP is now correctly set.
* Invalid values of WeekOfMonth field are now handled in Exchange ActiveSync synchronization of calendar appointments.
* Improved flag management to remove risk of conflict between web client and EAS client mail flag updates.
* Attendee calendar now updates with actual appointment schedule and not with the date and time they saved it on.

## Known Issues

### NG Backup

* Users encounter a restore issue that terminates a restore operation before recovering conversations, if users sent attachments in any of the conversations.

### ZCO

* Outlook 2013 can crash while "proposing a new time" for a meeting.

# Patch Installation

Please refer to the steps below to install 8.8.15 Patch 11 on [Redhat](#Redhat) and [Ubuntu](#Ubuntu) platforms:

Before Installing the Patch

Before installing the patch, consider the following:

## Redhat

Installing Zimbra packages with system package upgrades

* As `root`, first clear the yum cache and check for updates so the server sees there is a new `zimbra-patch` package in the patch repository:

```
yum clean metadata

## Security Fixes

| Summary | CVE-ID | CVSS Score | Zimbra Rating | Fix Patch Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities | [CVE-2020-13653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13653) | 4.3 | Minor | 9.0.0 P4 |

## What's New

Zimbra 9.0.0 is now fully supported on RHEL 8 (GA)

Download the latest RHEL 8 binaries from <https://www.zimbra.com/downloads>

### Common

* Event details open in a new tab when users create an event, allowing them to navigate and use the Modern Web App without losing unsaved event details information.

### Mail

* Users now have an option to write emails in plain-text.
* When a user delegates access to another user with "Save a copy of sent messages to my Sent folder" setting enabled, then mails sent by the delegate are saved in delegator's sent folder.
* After selecting a message, users can create a quick filter from the email context menu.
* In message and invitation forwards and replies, the header information of the original message is now duplicated in the body of the new message. This gives new recipients a view of who the original message or invitation was sent to, who sent it, and when it was sent.
* Users may observe improved performance when using composer for creating messages and managing drats.

### Contacts

* **Deleted Contacts** has been renamed to **Trash**, and the right-click context menu for **Trash** now has the option **Empty Trash**. These changes are present in all supported languages.
* Users can assign a tag, or delete any existing tags for single/multiple contacts.

### Calendar

* Every event invitation now includes a copy of the event information in the email body so that invitees using third-party clients can see the event info without opening the `.ics` attachment. Previously, only events with content in the **Notes** field had an email body in the invitation.

### Briefcase

* Users can now share folders with other internal users. All the permissions are similar to Mail folder sharing.
* Folder Navigation support has been added. Users can now create, rename, delete, and move folders/subfolders.
* For Briefcase, file moves can be performed via "drag & drop".

### Search

* Users will have more options in Advance Search :- Unread mails, Starred mails, Status, Tag.
* Enhanced Advanced Search for email. Users will now have options to:
  + Search in subject or body or both.
  + Add Date options -- Send before, Send after, Send on.

### Settings

* Improvements in Persona management in **Settings** > **Accounts**. Selecting an existing Persona opens it in an edit mode where users can modify or delete the Persona.
* We've simplified the user settings for forwarding email, under **Settings** > **Accounts** > {DEFAULT} > **Access your email elsewhere**.

### Web UX - Classic

* We have added a Zimlet for the Classic Web App to notify users of an unsupported browser Internet Explorer that it is , and encourage them to upgrade. It is recommended that this Zimlet be enabled and mandatory for all users in order to reduce support calls.
* The sign-in screen, sign-in Help modal, "Forgot Password" workflow, Client Preferences, and Profile menu are now localized in all supported languages.

### ZCO

* Inline images in meeting notes now sync to Zimbra and are encoded to appear as inline images in the Zimbra Web Apps, instead of being attachments.

### Zimbra Connect

* Zimbra Connect has added UI support for: Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Indonesian, Thai, and Hindi languages.

### Zimbra Drive

* Zimbra Drive has added UI support for: Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Indonesian, Thai, and Hindi languages.

## Fixed Issues

### Platform

* Zimbra Collaboration on RHEL 8, **Monitor** > **Server** Status now no longer shows the running services as stopped.
* + Fixed Null pointer exception encountered while sending mail using data source created without an email address
* + Fixed permission denied error while sending email to DL from user having SendAs rights
* + **Note:** Fixed above two issues in updated Patch version today dated July 03, 2020 which were reported on first version of 9.0.0 Patch 4

### Web UX - Modern

* Fixed a problem that caused email address resolution to unexpectedly trigger on some non-English keyboard layouts.
* Emails that contained HTML `<form>` tags were not being displayed, as a security precaution. These messages are now shown, with any potentially dangerous form actions suppressed by the Zimbra server's OWASP Sanitizer.

### ZCO

* Fixed an internationalization problem with the mailbox rules "Run Now" feature, that caused an error message if the language was set using a Language Interface pack instead of the language options in the advanced settings.
* Signatures containing external images (URL references) had those images added as attachments to messages. Such messages would appear in "has:attachment" searches when the only attachment was the signature image.
  Users now have an advanced option, "Signature pictures sent as attachments" to control this behavior. When disabled, the image URL will be used without an additional attachment, thereby reducing the size of the message.

### Zimbra Connect

* Connect now honors time zone settings when logging in from the Modern Web App.
* When a meeting host has left a meeting and attempts to start another one, they are now notified if their previous call still has attendees on line. The host may choose to return to that call, or terminate it to start their new one.
* Users can now choose if they want to activate the webcam, the microphone, or both before joining a meeting.
  + Users are no longer required to have both a webcam and a microphone to start an audio call.
* Connect now has a notification built in the Modern Web App. It sounds an alert for 10 seconds when a user is invited to join a group/space/channel video call.
* Added GAL searches when an internal user is sending invitations for an existing instant meeting.
* User interactions have been improved. Users can now silence other participants, disable other participants' video. Disabled streams appear with an icon.
* Graphical restyling: The look of conversations is more clear, space is better used, and users can see more messages without scrolling.
* Improved user experience when the host leaves an Instant Meeting.
* Minichat size is increased and the header is rebuilt.
* Added translations for Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch locale.
* Now pictures can be set as an icon in Connect groups to identify them more easily.
  + Profile pictures are always centered and not tiled.

### Zimbra Docs

* Editing documents from the briefcase if the default domain is not set has been fixed.
* Docs is now able to open a specific version of the file from Drive.

### Zimbra Drive

* Users can now attach files from Zimbra drive while using the Modern Web App as well. Earlier, this option was available only in the classic web app.
* Added translations for
  + Portuguese
  + French
  + German
  + Italian
  + Spanish
  + Dutch
  + Japanese
  + Simplified Chinese
  + Indonesian
  + Thai
  + Hindi
    NOTE: Translations are still in beta. Admin Console translations are planned for the next release.
* Drive now implements file versions handling.
* Save to drive feature in the Modern Web App allows email attachments to be saved directly into drive.
* Users can now add multiple files from their drive to their emails. Earlier, they had to add each file individually.
* If a user tries to create a new share to an external email address in Drive, now a popup with an error message is shown instead of the full stack trace.
* Fixed a menu icon which was missing from Edit with docs menu in drive.
* Improved scrollbar management when enabling/disabling the info panel in drive.
* Fixed an issue that displayed only the first 30 results when searching drive items while the browser zoom setting is close to 70%.

### HSM

* The `doCheckBlobs` command resets the list of checked files after each mailbox check, to reduce memory usage.
* Administrators can now choose a target volume when using the command `mailboxmove` to move mail and drive items.
* Continue with another policy when an HSM policy’s destination volume has reached the space threshold.
* `doMoveBlobs` now checks if a secondary store is set before executing the `doMoveBlobs` operation and returns the error `Secondary store not set` when not set.
* Dumpster items during mailbox move operations are now verified for missing blobs.
* Fixed a description mismatch for s3 bucket region between command line and web admin interface.
* In `doCheckBlobs` operations, setting `check_digests` and `fix_incorrect_compressed_digests` to `true` verifies if a blob has been compressed twice and fixes that.
* Improved `doCheckBlobs` command output so that an account is listed only once.

### NG Backup

* Now the external restore can restore all the contacts groups in the accounts even if the restore operation is interrupted before all the accounts have been scanned.
* Smart Scan now performs backup and coherency checks to determine if a missing blob is found in the backup while HSM service is disabled.
* The command `zxsuite backup doRestoreBlobs` now checks if the volume id is valid and returns an error if the check fails.
* Added account id reference in `undelete` log lines in `mailbox.log` to simplify the debug operations.
* Allow only external restore operations to recover accounts that do not belong to any domain present on this host.
* Improved `doCoherencyCheck` memory management, so it keeps only the exception message instead of the complete stack trace.

### NG Mobile

* Implemented anti-DOS service for mobile devices. Number of requests is counted within a time window, and if exceeded device is jailed for a specified duration.
* The user’s last login in LDAP is now correctly set.
* Invalid values of WeekOfMonth field are now handled in Exchange ActiveSync synchronization of calendar appointments.
* Improved flag management to remove risk of conflict between web client and EAS client mail flag updates.
* Attendee calendar now updates with actual appointment schedule and not with the date and time they saved it on.

## Known Issues

* Users encounter a restore issue that terminates a restore operation before recovering conversations if users send attachments in any of the conversations.

* Zimlet patches can include removing existing Zimlets and redeploying the patched Zimlet.
* Only files or Zimlets associated with installed packages will be installed from the patch.
* Switch to `zimbra` user before using ZCS CLI commands.
* **Important!** You cannot revert to the previous ZCS release after you upgrade to the patch.
* **Important Note for ZCS Setup with Local ZCS repository:** Customers who have set up local ZCS repository should first update the local repository by following instructions in [wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository#Keep_the_local_Repository_up_to_date)
* Please make note that, installing the zimbra-patch package only updates the Zimbra core packages.

## What's New

**NOTE:** Beta features are not supported and should not be installed on production systems. Beta modules have been provided for evaluation in lab environments only.

**RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) 8 support (Beta)**

We are nearing the end of our extensive QA cycle for this major upgrade. Watch for the GA announcement in an upcoming patch release.

Check [RHEL Upgraded Packages](#RHEL_Upgraded_Packages) for previous and current versions of included packages.

### Zimbra Classic Web Client (ZWC)

* The login screen that external users engage to authenticate for resource sharing has been updated to visually match the Modern login screen.

### Zimbra Connector for Outlook

* **Zimbra Free/Busy Provider** is now Generally Available. Refer to the Admin Guide for operation details.
* When creating a new Rule (aka Zimbra Filter) using ZCO, the user is given the option to run it immediately.

### Zimbra Connect

* Previously the loss of the WebSocket connection would cause the loss of all pending messages; now the Zimlet retries to send the pending messages every 10 seconds.
* **Additional Language support** (Beta) - Zimbra Connect has added support for: French, Japanese, and Dutch locales.
* The screen share feature has been rewritten so that it no longer requires the chrome plugin and is available on the Modern Web App.

### Modern Web App

Briefcase

Briefcase feature (beta) in Modern Web App currently supports the following features:

* + Upload files to briefcase
  + Download files from the briefcase
  + Delete files in the briefcase
  + Add an attachment to an email, from briefcase
  + Save an email attachment, to briefcase

... and many more on the way!

Zimlets

* Zimlets now carry a user-friendly display name.
* User feedback zimlet is now present as an optional zimlet for Users. When this zimlet is enabled, end users can send direct feedback about Modern UI to the Zimbra 9 product team. To access this zimlet click on the Settings icon in the Modern Web App.
* The Zimlets section of the Admin Guide is updated to cover the changes from 8.8.15, which are specific to Zimlets for the Modern Web App.
* To enhance events' management, declined events appear with a strike-through in users' calendars. Users can choose to view or hide declined events based on the setting under Calendar and Reminders->Declined Events.

Earlier, declined events were removed from the calendar altogether.

* **Propose new time:** Event invitees can now respond to the organizer with a proposed new time for the event, which the organizer can choose to [Accept] or [Decline]. If organizers accept the change, the event's edit screen helps them edit the event or series before sending the updated event to all invitees.
* The app now allows movement of subfolders to any of the system or user-created folders using the drag and drop.
* Translations for supported languages have been updated for several new features.
* When users compose a new message, it opens in a new tab. This feature gives greater flexibility when navigating between various verticals and managing drafts.
* Modern web app now supports more languages -- Polish, Russian, Dutch, Portuguese, Korean, and Traditional Chinese for Hong Kong and Taiwan. Please note that this is currently a beta feature as machine translations have been used for these languages. These will be refined in future patches.
* "Trusted Addresses and Domains" setting has been added under, "Viewing Emails". This setting gives users the flexibility to decide the specified addresses or domains which can be trusted to display images by default.
* Following changes have been made in Settings to improve the user experience:
  + Moved **Display Images** from **Security and Activity** section to **Viewing Emails**.
  + **Security and Activity** tab will only be enabled when user-sessions-management zimlet is enabled for the Users.
* New email notifications are more informative, and carry the sender's name, email subject, and some part of the email body (when display space is available in the notification).
* In **Settings** > **Writing Email**, users can now choose *Right to Left* as a compose direction for writing emails.
* Users can now search various file types using advanced search filters options.
  + Please note that the Sheet, Slides, and Compressed categories do not include the following file types:
    - Sheet = .ots, .ods
    - Slides = .csv, .otp, .odp, .potx, .potm
    - Compressed = .tar, .rar, .tgz, .jar
* In Settings -> Writing Email -> Composer, users can now set default preferences for Font, Font Size, and colors for composing an email.
* Earlier, if senders had set a persona with a different Reply-to address, receivers' preview pane did not display it; and replies did not go to that Reply-to email address specified in the persona. Now, the Reply-to address defined in senders' persona appears correctly for receivers and senders receive the replies to this address.

### NG Modules

* New drive blobs will now honor NG HSM compression settings.
* Basic bucket management commands are now available from the command line. (`docreatebucket`, `listbuckets`, `doupdatebucket`, and `dodeletebucket`)
* The `mailboxmove` notification e-mail sent to the admin now lists also the accounts that were not moved.
* Like `doCheckBlobs`, these commands now return the monitor command when run:
  + `doAccountScan`
  + `DoCheckShares`
  + `DoCoherencyCheck`
  + `DoExternalRestore`
  + `DoCheckBlobs`
  + `DoDeduplicate`
  + `DoMoveBlobs`
  + `DoVolumeToVolumeMove`
  + `DoPurgeMailboxes`
  + `DoRemoveOrphanedBlobs`
  + Improved the Email sent to the admin after a `doPurgeMailboxes` command, to list detailed information for each purged mailbox.
* Improved output when a `doRestoreOnNewAccount` failed because backup data was not available on the current server for the source account.
* The `zimbraFeatureTaskEnabled` at COS/Account level now defines whether Tasks are synchronized via EAS.
* The Docs server software has been upgraded to align with CODE 4.2. "This release includes a fresh look, ...improved inter-operability, new dialogs, and functionality as well as a raft of bug fixes and polish." Read more on [collaboraoffice.com](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code-4-2-0-release).
* A scroll bar has been added to make file browsing easier for public users when accessing a Drive share with a lot of files.
* **Additional Language support** (Beta) - Zimbra Drive has added support for: French, Japanese, and Dutch locales.

## Fixed Issues

### Zimbra Collaboration

* Meeting invites, created in Outlook (Mac), sent to external participants can now be imported into Mac Calendar or Thunderbird/Lightning without errors.

### Zimbra Connector for Outlook

* Fixed a day-1 issue that caused Outlook to crash when creating a Zimbra profile with a name containing extended Unicode characters.
* Fixed some minor cosmetic problems in the Rules wizard.

### Modern Web App

* The tab bar, which contains Mail, Contact, and Calendar tabs, now has a border demarcating it from the rest of the interface.
* When creating events the web app displayed a font named "Undefined" under font options. After this fix, font options display proper names for all available fonts.
* Users could not snooze or dismiss event notifications from shared calendars. They received the error - "Permission denied". After this fix, users can dismiss shared calendars' event notifications without errors.
* When Users hover over labels on Contact actions, information for that action is displayed.
* When users tried to archive an email, error toast message "There was a problem creating the archive folder" was displayed and the archive failed. After this fix, users can now archive emails successfully.
* Users can now launch the composer by clicking `mailto:` links in the Contact hovercard. Earlier, this action displayed a 404 error.
* RSVP action buttons no longer appear on canceled event notification emails.
* When users right-click an already read email, the option "Mark as Read" no longer appears.
* In the Contacts tab, whenever users selected a contact to view it in a resized screen or a smaller Contacts pane, the contact's information did not adjust to the available space. After this fix, the contact information adjusts to the available space without obscuring any information.
* Users can now move emails from the search list or tag folder to other folders using Drag and Drop.

### NG Changelog

* Fixed some minor graphical issues with drive's upload button (hover rule not working, bottom border)
* Fixed a bug that could cause zip file corruption when downloading a large directory from Drive.
* Fixed an issue where closing a PDF file took a lot of time and it kept buffering.
* Recipients can now open a shared drive link.
* Fixed an issue that prevented a delegated admin from setting migration to ng (`zxsuite admin doMigrateAdmin`) if a different delegated admin had been deleted only from ldap (e.g. by `zmprov -l da #adminaccount`).
* Fixed a bug that could cause a file descriptor leak when running any operation that moved blobs between volumes with the same compression settings targeting a volume with a large number of files.
* When encountering a metadata file without a digest value, the backup purge will now simply log an error at debug level and proceed.
* Running the doCoherencyCheck operation with the fixBackup option now also fixes "CoS not found" errors that may happen after a migration.
* When restoring dynamic distribution lists from a backup, Zimbra ids of old items were not replaced with the new ids. Now ids are correctly updated on restoring the lists.
* Fixed the output of the command `zxsuite mobile getdeviceinfo #account #deviceid` that mismatched values and descriptions (language was displayed under os, for example).
* Fixed a date parsing error that made it impossible to search for messages before/after specific dates when the language was set to Hungarian.
* Fixed a bug that caused the Modern Web App to fail loading when some User Preferences or System Limitations (e.g., `zimbraFileUploadMaxSize`) were configured to be larger than a 32-bit integer (2,147,483,647).
* Improved tab handling logic so that the cursor’s position in the document is maintained after switching away from and then back to the document editing tab.
* Fixed a problem with string encoding/decoding while sending DB rows during `doMailboxMove` that would cause the operation to fail on some mailboxes.

### Zimbra Connect

* Group members could chat amongst themselves but could not join a video call. This issue is now fixed.
* Fixed a bug the caused Instant Meeting chat message timestamps to be always in UTC instead of following the client’s settings.
* Instant Meeting invite emails are now sent to all participants, including internal users.
* Fixed a bug that caused the icon in the invitation email to disappear and show only a grey square.

### NG Admin

* To avoid the unwanted/unauthorized activation of paid features, delegated Admins are now unable to change the status of features like EWS, MAPI, and Archiving even when the "Edit Features" flag is enabled in their administrative rights.
* **Reminder:** During installation, upgrade, and periodically while in use, the ZCS server transmits information for reconciliation of billing and license data. Notices about this have been added to the Admin Guide and Installation Guides.

## Known Issues

* When users select draft emails individually, the delete icon in the preview pane becomes unavailable.
* Zimbra Collaboration on RHEL 8 (beta), **Monitor** -> **Server Status** shows all the services as stopped even when the services are running on the server.

Please refer to the steps below to install 9.0.0 Patch 2 on [Redhat](#Redhat) and [Ubuntu](#Ubuntu) platforms:

## Before Installing the Patch

Before installing the patch, consider the following:

* Patches are cumulative.
* A full backup should be performed before any patch is applied. There is no automated roll-back.
* Zimlet patches can include removing existing Zimlets and redeploying the patched Zimlet.
* Only files or Zimlets associated with installed packages will be installed from the patch.
* Switch to `zimbra` user before using ZCS CLI commands.

**Important** You cannot revert to the previous ZCS release after you upgrade to the patch. Customers who have set up local ZCS repository should first update the local repository by following instructions in [wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository#Keep_the_local_Repository_up_to_date).

* Please make note that, installing the `zimbra-patch` package only updates the Zimbra core packages.
