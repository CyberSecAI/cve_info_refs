Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two issues: information disclosure via intercepted network messages and the use of a weak hash that can be easily discovered through network traffic analysis. The device transmits sensitive information over the local network, protected by a hash. However, the hash is weak and can be obtained by monitoring network traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Information Disclosure:** The device transmits sensitive information in network messages that can be intercepted.
2.  **Weak Hash Handling:** The device uses a weak hashing algorithm that is susceptible to discovery by observing network traffic, thus failing to adequately protect the sensitive information transmitted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who can intercept the network traffic and is familiar with the hashing mechanism can obtain sensitive information from the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves intercepting network traffic on the local network where the vulnerable device is connected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable DSP-W215 device to intercept the network traffic. They also need knowledge of the hashing method in use by the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected product is the D-Link DSP-W215 Rev. Ax with firmware 1.26B03.
*   The product is End-of-Life (EoL) and End-of-Support (EoS), meaning no further firmware updates or support will be provided.
*   D-Link recommends that US consumers retire the product due to the security risks.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was discovered through a third-party report by Leopoldo Aguirre.
*  The advisory also links to CVE-2020-13136, indicating another vulnerability affecting the same device that was discovered simultaneously.
