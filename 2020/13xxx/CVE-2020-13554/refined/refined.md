Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-13554:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is weak permissions on the `webvrpcs.exe` binary and the corresponding registry entries that execute this binary on system startup. The `webvrpcs.exe` binary is located in `C:\WebAccess\Node\` and has weak permissions, allowing standard users to modify it. The registry entry ensures that this binary will be executed on each user login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The `webvrpcs.exe` binary has overly permissive access control lists (ACLs), allowing regular users to modify the file.
*   **Registry Run Key Vulnerability**: The `webvrpcs` binary is referenced in the Windows Registry's "Run" key which causes the binary to be executed when a user logs in. Because a standard user can modify the binary and it will execute with the privileges of the user logging in it provides a privilege escalation opportunity.
*   **Persistence:** The use of the "Run" key allows for a persistent backdoor as the modified binary will execute each time a new user logs in and starts the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can modify the `webvrpcs.exe` binary with malicious code. When a user logs in, the modified binary is executed with the user's privileges, and therefore providing an attacker with a privilege escalation. If the user is an administrator then the attacker can obtain administrator privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code by replacing `webvrpcs.exe` with their malicious binary or DLL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to modify the `webvrpcs.exe` file and its registry entry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to write to the file system and modify the specified registry entries.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability allows for a persistent backdoor, as the attacker's code will be executed every time a new user logs into the system.
*   The vulnerability specifically uses the `webvrpcs` binary and its associated registry keys for the exploit.
*   This vulnerability is one of multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities identified in Advantech WebAccess/SCADA 9.0.1.
