Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities discovered, along with their root causes and impacts.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities stems from inadequate hardware design and implementation of security features in the microcontrollers. Specifically, the analysis reveals:

*   **Insufficient Debug Interface Protection:** Flaws in how the debug interface is locked down in RDP level 1, allowing unauthorized memory access through various methods.
*   **Insecure DMA Implementation:** The Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller is not properly restricted when a debugger is present, allowing it to be used to read out flash memory.
*   **Instruction Bus Access:**  Access to flash memory via the instruction bus is not properly blocked when a debugger is present, enabling exploits via exception handling.
*   **Dual-Die Design Weakness:** The dual-die design, with exposed inter-die bonding wires, allows for invasive attacks to eavesdrop on or manipulate memory communication.
*   **FPB Vulnerabilities:** The Flash Patch and Breakpoint (FPB) unit, used for firmware live patching, is exploited through power glitching and SRAM data remanence to redirect control flow.
*   **Obfuscation Weakness:** The address and data obfuscation techniques applied on the QSPI bus are easily reverse-engineered

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
The document describes the following vulnerabilities, categorized by their attack vectors:

*   **D1-A: Load Instruction Exploitation (CKS32F103, GD32VF103):** Load instructions executed by the CPU are not adequately blocked when a debugger is present, allowing the CPU to read flash memory, thus allowing for firmware extraction by controlled execution.
*   **D1-B: Extraction via Exceptions (STM32F103, APM32F103, CKS32F103):** The instruction bus allows interrupt vector fetches from flash memory even when a debugger is connected, which is exploitable by generating exceptions and extracting memory contents.
*   **D1-C: VTOR Control Flow Redirection (GD32F103):** A vulnerability where the VTOR can be manipulated to redirect execution to an attacker-controlled SRAM region.
*  **D2: DMA Access Exploitation (CKS32F103, GD32F103):** The DMA module is not properly restricted, allowing it to read flash memory into SRAM.
*   **H1: Invasive Data Eavesdropping (GD32F103, GD32F130):**  The communication between the logic and flash memory dies via a QSPI bus can be eavesdropped by physically accessing the bonding wires.
*   **H2: Invasive RDP Manipulation (GD32F130):** The RDP level can be manipulated by injecting faults into the QSPI address signals to load the option bytes from an alternate location in flash, thereby bypassing the RDP protection, such as level 2, and enabling debug access.
*  **H3: Shellcode Execution via Glitch and FPB (APM32F103, STM32F103):** The Flash Patch and Breakpoint (FPB) unit is misused for code injection by combining a power glitch with SRAM-booting and FPB configuration, leading to the execution of an attacker shellcode.

**Impact of Exploitation**
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in:

*   **Full Firmware Extraction:** An attacker can extract 100% of the firmware from every tested device.
*   **Circumvention of Security Measures:** The attacks bypass the intended security mechanisms implemented in RDP level 1 and even RDP level 2, which is designed to disable the debug interface entirely.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The FPB glitch allows for the execution of arbitrary attacker code, gaining full control over the device.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The extracted firmware may contain proprietary algorithms, cryptographic keys, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors**
The attack vectors include:
*   **Debug Interface:** Exploiting flaws in debug interface protection to read flash memory, redirect execution flow, or utilize DMA.
*   **Physical Access:** Gaining access to bonding wires on multi-die systems for eavesdropping on and manipulating inter-die communication.
* **Power Glitching:** Inducing power glitches to trigger system resets that leave the SRAM memory contents intact which can be combined with hardware breakpoints for code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
The attacks can be performed with relatively low-cost, DIY-level equipment. Specifically:
*   **Debug Interface Attacks:** Require a standard debugger interface (e.g. SWD), and the ability to connect to it, which is usually available in embedded systems development.
*   **Invasive Attacks:** Require access to the physical chip, materials for decapping and probing, and basic knowledge of electronic components.
*   **Power Glitch Attack:** Requires additional hardware that can control the supply voltage with microsecond precision, like a separate micro controller.
*   **General:** Requires knowledge on microcontroller architecture, memory access, and the related debug tools and interfaces.

This paper identifies multiple vulnerabilities across various microcontrollers, which may have different root causes but could lead to a complete compromise of security protections. The vulnerabilities can be exploited with limited skills, which increases their potential impact.
