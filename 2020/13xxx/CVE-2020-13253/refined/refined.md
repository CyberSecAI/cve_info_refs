  "CVE-2020-13253": {
    "description": "The QEMU SD memory card implementation incorrectly handled certain memory operations. An attacker inside a guest could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds read access in the SD Memory Card emulator due to improper handling of addresses during block write commands.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service by crashing the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious guest can send a write command with an out-of-bounds address."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have code execution capabilities inside the guest VM.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the sdhci_write() function when handling SD card block write commands. It was discovered that the emulator was not properly checking if the provided address was within the bounds of the 's->wp_groups'. A patch was introduced to verify that the requested address belongs to the actual card size, and if not, return an ADDRESS_ERROR. This fix prevents out-of-bounds access."
