# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## [PATCH 1/2] sd: check bit number before setting card\_status flag

| **Subject**: | [PATCH 1/2] sd: check bit number before setting card\_status flag |
| **Date**: | Wed, 20 May 2020 20:54:49 +0530 |

---

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <address@hidden>

SD card emulator sets 'sd->card_status' while performing block
write commands. While doing so, it tests the corresponding bit
derived from 's->data_start' address. This may lead to OOB access.
Add check to avoid it.

### Bug Description

An out-of-bounds read access issue was found in the SD Memory Card emulator of the QEMU. It occurs while performing block write commands via sdhci\_write(), if a guest user has sent 'address' which is OOB of 's->wp\_groups'. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS.

Hmm I guess I typed "^RPrasad" in my shell to have the last git-publish

command with his email, and I didn't noticed you were also there...

Anyway looking at it again, this patch is wrong because I should check

for addr + blksize < sd\_size instead. Can you drop it please?

While the reproducer triggers the OOB via CMD24, other commands have the

same problem, so I'll post a v3.

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

Package        : qemu
Version        : 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u11
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-1711 CVE-2020-13253 CVE-2020-14364 CVE-2020-16092
Debian Bug     : 968947 961297 949731

The following security issues have been found in qemu, which could
potentially result in DoS and execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2020-1711

    An out-of-bounds heap buffer access flaw was found in the way the iSCSI
    Block driver in QEMU handled a response coming from an iSCSI server
    while checking the status of a Logical Address Block (LBA) in an
    iscsi_co_block_status() routine. A remote user could use this flaw to
    crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service or potential
    execution of arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the
    host.

CVE-2020-13253

    An out-of-bounds read access issue was found in the SD Memory Card
    emulator of the QEMU. It occurs while performing block write commands
    via sdhci_write(), if a guest user has sent 'address' which is OOB of
    's->wp_groups'. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the
    QEMU process resulting in DoS.

CVE-2020-14364

    An out-of-bounds read/write access issue was found in the USB emulator
    of the QEMU. It occurs while processing USB packets from a guest, when
    'USBDevice->setup_len' exceeds the USBDevice->data_buf[4096], in
    do_token_{in,out} routines.

CVE-2020-16092

    An assertion failure can occur in the network packet processing. This
    issue affects the e1000e and vmxnet3 network devices. A malicious guest
    user/process could use this flaw to abort the QEMU process on the host,
    resulting in a denial of service condition in
    net_tx_pkt_add_raw_fragment in hw/net/net_tx_pkt.c

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u11.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

Ah, this is different that the one reported recently:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1878054](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/1878054)

Do you have a reproducer?

Is this a CVE?

```

```
This should never be called with a such address, so I'd simply use an
assertion here.
```

```
The problem is earlier where the address should be validated and a
protocol error returned.

Subject: CVE-2020-13253 QEMU: sd: OOB access could crash the guest resulting
 in DoS

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds read access issue was found in the SD Memory Card emulator of
the QEMU. It occurs while performing block write commands via sdhci_write(),
if a guest user has sent 'address' which is OOB of 's->wp_groups'. A guest
user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS.

Upstream bug/thread:
   -> [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1880822](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/1880822)
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg05877.html>

This issue was reported by Alexander Bulekov(CC'd). 'CVE-2020-13253' requested
via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.
