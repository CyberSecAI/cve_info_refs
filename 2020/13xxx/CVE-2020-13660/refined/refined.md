- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The "Name" field in the File Picker module's "Add a new Profile" functionality was not properly sanitized or filtered, allowing the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Name" field which will be executed when the File Picker page is accessed. This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin access can navigate to the File Picker module, create a new profile, and inject a malicious payload into the name field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the "Extensions" and "File Picker" sections in the CMS Made Simple admin console.
