Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-13568:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `phpGACL` library, specifically within the `admin/edit_group.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands via the `group_id` POST parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `group_id` POST parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization in the `get_group_data` function, which is called by `edit_group`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to perform malicious actions on the database, including potentially reading sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking complete control of the database server. The provided proof of concept shows the attacker can use `sleep()` to cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/edit_group.php` file with a malicious `group_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid session cookie (`$cookie`) to access the vulnerable page.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `admin/edit_group.php` script and the structure of the required parameters

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `get_group_data` function, which is called by the `edit_group` function.
*   The `group_id` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to inject a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data or induce a delay, but the attack surface is not limited to this.
*   This vulnerability is present in phpGACL version 3.3.7.
*   OpenEMR versions 5.0.2 and development version 6.0.0 (commit babec93f600ff1394f91ccd512bcad85832eb6ce) are affected as they use this vulnerable library.
