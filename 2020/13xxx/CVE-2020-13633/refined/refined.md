The provided content relates to CVE-2020-13633.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in the navigation title meta properties. Specifically, it was possible to inject JavaScript code into both the frontend and backend of the application through these meta properties.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session by injecting malicious code into the navigation title's meta properties. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Accessing sensitive data within the application

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the injection of malicious JavaScript code via the navigation title's meta properties.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to modify the navigation title meta properties. This likely means the attacker needs to have administrative access or the ability to otherwise influence the data that is used to populate these meta properties.
