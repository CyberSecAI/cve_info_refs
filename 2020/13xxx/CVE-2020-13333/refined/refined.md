Based on the provided JSON data, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how GitLab handles project exports, specifically with regard to Large File Storage (LFS) objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control:** A user with "reporter" access, which should have limited privileges, is able to export an entire project, including LFS objects. This bypasses the intended security model where LFS object access is restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with "reporter" access to a project can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in LFS objects that they were not meant to see.
- **Limited Impact:**  The impact is limited to confidentiality; there is no indication of data modification or availability issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have "reporter" access to a GitLab project.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required beyond the initial project access.

**Affected Versions:**
- GitLab versions:
    -  >=12.7 and <13.1.10
    -  >=13.2 and <13.2.8
    -  >=13.3 and <13.3.4
