Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE-2020-13452**: While the CVE description is a placeholder, the content from the GitHub issue clearly points to multiple vulnerabilities that lead to arbitrary code execution in the Gotenberg container, which is a strong indicator that this content relates to CVE-2020-13452.

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The issue mentions "several vulnerabilities" leading to arbitrary code execution but does not provide specific details in the public issue.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The content describes "several vulnerabilities," which is a vulnerability in itself, that exist within Gotenberg. The details are not publicly specified within this issue, but they can be exploited to gain code execution in the container.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to arbitrary code execution within the container. This is a critical impact that could lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
* **Attack vectors:**  The content does not specify the attack vectors. However, the fact that it's arbitrary code execution, in the context of Gotenberg (which is used for document conversion), it can be inferred that the attack vector probably lies within the file conversion capabilities, where malformed files could trigger the vulnerabilities and achieve code execution.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be in a position to send malicious files/requests to the Gotenberg application to trigger the vulnerability, given that it is the most plausible way to exploit these kinds of vulnerabilities. The specific requirements for this are not provided here.

The provided issue highlights a critical security flaw in Gotenberg, but additional information is required to provide a more technical and detailed analysis of the issue and the root causes for this CVE.
