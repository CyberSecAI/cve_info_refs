Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13893

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically when handling Unicode characters during input processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means the malicious script is saved in the application's database or persistent storage and executed when other users access the affected data.
*   **Unicode Transformation Bypass:** The application is vulnerable to a bypass using full-width variants of the less-than (`%EF%BC%9C`) and greater-than (`%EF%BC%9E`) signs. These characters are interpreted as `<`, `>`, respectively after Unicode transformation, and can be used to inject malicious code. This suggests the application is performing some encoding/decoding, and the injection occurs before sanitization or in a way that bypasses sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability can allow an attacker to escalate privileges. This could happen if an administrator or other privileged user views the injected malicious code. The attacker's script could perform actions on their behalf.
*   **Arbitrary Web Script or HTML Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code, leading to various malicious activities like stealing cookies/session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Input Fields:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious code through various input fields within the application.
*   **Authentication Required:** Exploitation requires an attacker to be authenticated, suggesting this vulnerability is available to users with access to the application.
*   **Unicode Transformation:** The use of full-width characters is critical to bypass the application's input validation, highlighting a flaw in its handling of Unicode input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Sage EasyPay application.
*   **Ability to Input Data:** The attacker requires the ability to input data into the vulnerable application fields.
