Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `ssl.c` file of the Axel download accelerator.
- The TLS implementation in Axel lacks proper hostname verification. This means that when establishing an SSL/TLS connection, the client (Axel) does not verify if the hostname presented in the server's certificate matches the hostname it intended to connect to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Hostname Verification:** The core issue is the absence of hostname verification during the TLS handshake.
- **Use of `SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths`:** While the code does load root authorities, it does not use `SSL_set1_host` to set the intended hostname, nor does it implement a certificate verification callback, which are needed for proper hostname verification.
- **Potentially Insecure Code:** The specific code in `ssl.c` related to setting up the SSL context and connection is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the client (Axel) and the server can intercept the connection and present a fraudulent certificate for a different domain.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Because Axel doesn't verify the hostname, it will accept the fraudulent certificate and continue communication with the attacker's server. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on the communication and potentially gain access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based.
- **MitM Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate the network traffic between Axel and the intended server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic. This could be done on a local network (e.g. malicious Wi-Fi hotspot) or by compromising network infrastructure.
- **Fake Certificate:** The attacker needs to have a valid TLS certificate for a domain name, which is different from the actual server, that they want to impersonate. This certificate needs to be signed by a trusted root CA that is present on the target system.
- **Transparent Proxy or DNS Manipulation:** The attacker can use a transparent proxy or DNS poisoning to redirect Axel's traffic to the attacker's server instead of the intended server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity.
- The issue is fixed in Axel version 2.17.8 and later by adding SSL hostname verification.
- Multiple Linux distributions, including openSUSE and Fedora, have released updates to address this vulnerability in their respective packages.
