# Axel may not verify server certificate CN/SAN/hostname (allowing SSL interception) #262

## Description

![@theopolis](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981645?u=64c10116e2425e59183f9ef4f4c12ee9093699b4&v=4&size=48)[theopolis](https://github.com/theopolis)opened [on Mar 16, 2020](https://github.com/axel-download-accelerator/axel/issues/262#issue-582644624)

It looks like Axel's SSL's connections do not verify server certificate hostnames. To fix this the SSL context should set a certificate callback or use `SSL_set1_host` to set the intended hostname.

This is an issue since it uses `SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths` and loads all root authorities from the OS. See <https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Hostname_validation> for a description of this nuance with the OpenSSL APIs.

Here is potentially insecure code

<https://github.com/axel-download-accelerator/axel/blob/master/src/ssl.c#L83>

```
[...]
ssl_ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_client_method());
if (!conf->insecure) {
    SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths(ssl_ctx);
    SSL_CTX_set_verify(ssl_ctx, SSL_VERIFY_PEER, NULL);
}
SSL_CTX_set_mode(ssl_ctx, SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY);

ssl = SSL_new(ssl_ctx);
SSL_set_fd(ssl, fd);
SSL_set_tlsext_host_name(ssl, hostname);

int err = SSL_connect(ssl);
if (err <= 0) {
[...]
```

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 34 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchain](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchain "Changes/GNUToolchain")
* [F34Boost175](/wiki/Changes/F34Boost175 "Changes/F34Boost175")
* [F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.16](/wiki/Changes/golang1.16 "Changes/golang1.16")
* [Remove\_make\_from\_BuildRoot](/wiki/Changes/Remove_make_from_BuildRoot "Changes/Remove make from BuildRoot")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, Januar 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

### Remove make from BuildRoot

*koji block-group-pkg f34-rebuild build make*

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f34
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f34. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f34 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f34
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-20 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 32 on 2021-05-25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '32'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 32 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1848468#c7)  Fedora Update System    2021-05-05 00:53:39 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-90b4716992 has been pushed to the Fedora 33 stable repository. If problem still persists, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1848468#c8)  Fedora Update System    2021-05-05 01:21:22 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-5214bd8f14 has been pushed to the Fedora 34 stable repository. If problem still persists, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
