The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence regarding CVE-2020-13581.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the PlanMaker document parsing functionality of SoftMaker Office 2021's PlanMaker application. Specifically, it occurs when parsing record type `0x800d`. The application allocates a fixed-size (2048 bytes) buffer on the heap, but uses the record's length directly from the document to copy data into this buffer using `memcpy`. Because the application does not validate the record length, a crafted document with a length greater than the buffer size results in a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- Insufficient input validation of record length
- Use of `memcpy` without size checks

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.
- The crash information shows that the application attempts to dereference memory controlled by the attacker (0x4141414141414141) which is typical in heap overflows that overwrite a function pointer in an object.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious PlanMaker document (`.pmd` file) with a record of type `0x800d` that specifies a length greater than 2048 bytes.
- The victim is enticed to open the malicious document using the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted PlanMaker document.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious document to a victim. The victim must open the document using a vulnerable version of the software.
