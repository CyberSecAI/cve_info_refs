Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `libpam-tacplus` library, a PAM module used for TACACS+ authentication, was logging shared secrets (like private server keys) in plaintext when the debug parameter was enabled. This occurred when system logging was configured to use `journald`, which captures even DEBUG level messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Plaintext Logging:** The primary vulnerability is the logging of sensitive shared secrets in clear text within system logs.
- **Debug Mode Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the default example configuration for the `pam_tacplus` module included the debug parameter, potentially leading to unintended debug mode deployments in production environments.
- **Logging of Secrets:** The issue is that the library was directly logging the shared secret used for TACACS+ communication, rather than sanitizing or masking it before logging.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker gaining access to system logs (e.g., through unauthorized access, man-in-the-middle attacks) could extract the TACACS+ shared secret.
- **Decryption of TACACS+ Traffic:** With the shared secret, an attacker can decrypt captured TACACS+ traffic between the client and the server.
- **Potential Password Exposure:** While the vulnerability did not directly log user passwords, the decrypted TACACS+ traffic *could* potentially expose usernames and passwords transmitted for authentication.
- **Compromised Authentication:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to potentially bypass the TACACS+ authentication mechanism if the attacker is able to intercept the traffic and has the key.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Log Access:** The attacker needs access to system logs where the plaintext secrets were logged.
    - This could be through unauthorized access to the system, compromised accounts with sufficient privileges to read logs, or a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack intercepting log data.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM):** Once the secret is acquired, an attacker can intercept the communication to and from the TACACS+ server and decrypt the traffic, potentially stealing user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Log Access:** An attacker needs the ability to read system logs where the plaintext secrets have been written by the vulnerable software.
- **Network Interception (for MITM):** If the attacker wishes to decrypt and analyze TACACS+ traffic, they need to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the `pam_tacplus` client and the TACACS+ server.
- **Knowledge of TACACS+ Protocol:** An attacker would need to have knowledge of the TACACS+ protocol to properly decode and utilize captured traffic.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Adarsh Pandey from Arista Networks.
*   A fix was introduced in `pam_tacplus` version 1.5.3 and later versions by masking out the sensitive shared secret being logged.
*   The fix implemented was commit `4a9852c31c2fd0c0e72fbb689a586aabcfb11cb0` where logging of the server key was replaced with `******`.

This vulnerability primarily affects environments that utilize `pam_tacplus` with debug logging enabled and when system logs are being handled using `journald`. The primary impact is the potential disclosure of the TACACS+ shared secret which then could be used to decrypt user credentials.
