| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1843614#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-06-03 16:41:32 UTC  ``` In cases where a memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the memcached cache backends.

Red Hat Update Infrastructure 3 ships an affected version of python-django, however it does not use memcached as a cache backend and it is not vulnerable to this flaw.  Red Hat Ceph Storage(RHCS) ships an affected version of python-django used with calamari and graphite which are no longer supported, hence the django package will not be fixed for RHCS.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1843614#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-17 15:29:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.1  Via RHSA-2021:0915 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0915](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0915)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1843614#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-03-17 19:51:43 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 329 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2739494.1).

**Please note that since the release of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle WebLogic Server: [CVE-2020-14750 (November 1, 2020)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2020-14750.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply this Critical Patch Update, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2725756.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2725756.1).

# USN-4381-1: Django vulnerabilities

3 June 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

Dan Palmer discovered that Django incorrectly validated memcached cache

keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of

service and obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-13254](/security/CVE-2020-13254))

Jon Dufresne discovered that Django incorrectly encoded query parameters

for the admin ForeignKeyRawIdWidget. A remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to perform XSS attacks. ([CVE-2020-13596](/security/CVE-2020-13596))

Package        : python-django
Version        : 1.7.11-1+deb8u10
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-13254

It was discovered that there was a regression in the latest update to
Django, the Python web development framework. The upstream fix for
CVE-2020-13254 to address data leakages via malformed memcached keys
could, in some situations, cause a traceback.

Please see <<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31654>> for more
information.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in python-django version
1.7.11-1+deb8u10.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Archive of security issues[¶](#archive-of-security-issues "Permalink to this headline")

Django’s development team is strongly committed to responsible
reporting and disclosure of security-related issues, as outlined in
[Django’s security policies](../../internals/security/).

As part of that commitment, we maintain the following historical list
of issues which have been fixed and disclosed. For each issue, the
list below includes the date, a brief description, the [CVE identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)
if applicable, a list of affected versions, a link to the full
disclosure and links to the appropriate patch(es).

Some important caveats apply to this information:

* Lists of affected versions include only those versions of Django
  which had stable, security-supported releases at the time of
  disclosure. This means older versions (whose security support had
  expired) and versions which were in pre-release (alpha/beta/RC)
  states at the time of disclosure may have been affected, but are not
  listed.
* The Django project has on occasion issued security advisories,
  pointing out potential security problems which can arise from
  improper configuration or from other issues outside of Django
  itself. Some of these advisories have received CVEs; when that is
  the case, they are listed here, but as they have no accompanying
  patches or releases, only the description, disclosure and CVE will
  be listed.

## Issues prior to Django’s security process[¶](#issues-prior-to-django-s-security-process "Permalink to this headline")

Some security issues were handled before Django had a formalized
security process in use. For these, new releases may not have been
issued at the time and CVEs may not have been assigned.

## Description

On Django 2.2.13 the code for `memcache_key_warnings` in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` has a bad format string that results in raising an exception rather than just producing a warning. This can be reproduced with a memcached key with a space in it, e.g. `"foo bar"`.

This code was present before the 2.2.13 release, but becomes more exposed with that release, since it begins validating cache keys.

I think it's as simple as removing the `, CacheKeyWarning`.

Thanks for the report, we've already noticed this, see [​PR](https://github.com/django/django/pull/13017). It raises `InvalidCacheKey` for me (even if a message is not perfect), e.g.

```
File "django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py", line 157, in validate_key
    raise InvalidCacheKey(warning)

django.core.cache.backends.base.InvalidCacheKey: ("Cache key contains characters that will cause errors if used with memcached: '38_postgis_pull-requests-bionic_memcache:1:key with spaces and 清'", <class 'django.core.cache.backends.base.CacheKeyWarning'>)

```

The expected behaviour is to raise the InvalidCacheKey for memcached backends, addressing CVE-2020-13254.

Tim, can you post the traceback?

(How did you hit this?)

Ah, this was actually against the dummy backend.

This error only started happening in tests with the Django 2.2.12 -> 2.2.13 upgrade. I don't understand why we wouldn't have seen the InvalidCacheKey error in production, where we use memcached.

(We were in fact creating an invalid cache key, and I have a patch ready for that on our side that unblocks the upgrade, so I'm not sure how much we'll end up digging into that mystery!)

Thanks for the follow up Tim.

I still don't get the error using 3.5...

```
Python 3.5.9 (default, Jun  4 2020, 16:47:18)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from django.core.cache.backends.base import CacheKeyWarning
>>> import warnings

>>> warnings.warn(a_tuple, CacheKeyWarning)
__main__:1: CacheKeyWarning: ('A string message, plus...', <class 'django.core.cache.backends.base.CacheKeyWarning'>)

```

There must be something else going on. Maybe a custom warning formatting?

(How else is the `TypeError: 'type' object cannot be interpreted as an integer` — the warning class being converted to an int? 🤔)

[​The EdX change](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/24137) will stop the warning coming up, and is exactly the case that the patch was meant to catch.

Treating CacheKeyWarnings as errors would be good — I wonder how many folks would be seeing those and ignoring them... 😬

I think there's enough of a regression here to backport the fix.

### [comment:5](#comment:5) by Tim McCormack, [5 years ago](/timeline?from=2020-06-04T11%3A29%3A27-05%3A00&precision=second "See timeline at Jun 4, 2020, 11:29:27 AM")

I don't understand it either! I'll take a little more time to poke at it today. (For anyone who wants to reproduce this strange test error in place: Python 3.5 virtualenv with pip 20.0.2, `make requirements`, `pytest -s common/djangoapps/xblock_django/tests/test_api.py::XBlockSupportTestCase::test_authorable_blocks` -- on commit 9f53525c.) The farthest I've gotten is that it's definitely coming from inside `warnings.warn(...)`:

```
(Pdb) warnings.warn(("hi", str), RuntimeWarning)
*** TypeError: 'type' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

```

Why it doesn't happen on a fresh REPL with all dependencies loaded, I'm not sure. My best guess is that it has something to do with warning filtering, since that's configurable and appears to be what's inspecting the warning message. Probably not specifically relevant to Django or the edX code, though.

(Edit: Specified pip version.)

Out of curiosity, do you get the same crash if passing `category` as a keyword argument? `warnings.warn(warning, category=CacheKeyWarning)`

### [comment:7](#comment:7) by Mariusz Felisiak, [5 years ago](/timeline?from=2020-06-04T13%3A57%3A03-05%3A00&precision=second "See timeline at Jun 4, 2020, 1:57:03 PM")

I can reproduce this error when unpacking tuple

```
>>> warnings.warn(*("hi", str), RuntimeWarning)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'type' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

```

because `RuntimeWarning` is passed as `stacklevel`, it must be somewhere in EdX. Nevertheless we will fix this message.

I get the error even with `warnings.warn(message=("hi", dict), category=UserWarning)`. I suspect it depends on which warning filters are loaded in your environment.

Do you plan to re-release 3.0.7 and 2.2.13 to fix this, out of interest?

As an aside, I don't believe this was present before: See [​https://i.imgur.com/fZOegeI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/fZOegeI.jpg) and [​https://i.imgur.com/hyc3k4J.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hyc3k4J.jpg) - you can see that the CacheKeyWarning was removed/added (it was factored out into eventual call to warnings.warn.

malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data
leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the
memcached cache backends.

Thank you to Dan Palmer for the report and patch.

### CVE-2020-13596: Possible XSS via admin ForeignKeyRawIdWidget

Query parameters for the admin ForeignKeyRawIdWidget were not properly URL
encoded, posing an XSS attack vector. ForeignKeyRawIdWidget now
ensures query parameters are correctly URL encoded.

Thank you to Jon Dufresne for the report and patch.

Hi,

Is there any PoC to test it? I'm trying to patch a version low than 1.11. Version is 1.6.11 to be exact, but it seems code affected is not present, would like to be sure using a PoC.

Thanks!

Sorry, something went wrong.

Package        : python-django
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-9402 CVE-2020-13254 CVE-2020-13596

It was discovered that Django, a high-level Python web development
framework, did not properly sanitize input. This would allow a remote
attacker to perform SQL injection attacks, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
attacks, or leak sensitive information.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:1.10.7-2+deb9u9.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.11.29-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

For the detailed security status of python-django please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-django>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Django 2.2.13 release notes[¶](#django-2-2-13-release-notes "Link to this heading")

*June 3, 2020*

Django 2.2.13 fixes two security issues and a regression in 2.2.12.

## CVE-2020-13254: Potential data leakage via malformed memcached keys[¶](#cve-2020-13254-potential-data-leakage-via-malformed-memcached-keys "Link to this heading")

In cases where a memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing
malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data
leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the
memcached cache backends.

## CVE-2020-13596: Possible XSS via admin `ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`[¶](#cve-2020-13596-possible-xss-via-admin-foreignkeyrawidwidget "Link to this heading")

Query parameters for the admin `ForeignKeyRawIdWidget` were not properly URL
encoded, posing an XSS attack vector. `ForeignKeyRawIdWidget` now
ensures query parameters are correctly URL encoded.

## Bugfixes[¶](#bugfixes "Link to this heading")

* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2.12 that affected translation loading for
  apps providing translations for territorial language variants as well as a
  generic language, where the project has different plural equations for the
  language ([#31570](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31570)).
* Tracking a jQuery security release, upgraded the version of jQuery used by
  the admin from 3.3.1 to 3.5.1.
