```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue in the 'dsInstallerService' component of the Pulse Secure Windows Client.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The 'dsInstallerService' performs signature verification on the installer content, but an attacker can bypass this check by swapping a legitimate Pulse Secure installer with a malicious one after verification but before execution."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM by tricking 'PulseSecureService.exe' into running an arbitrary Microsoft Installer executable (.msi) with SYSTEM privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by manipulating the installer files after the signature verification but before execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to swap the installer files after verification."
