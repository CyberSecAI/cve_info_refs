- **Root cause of vulnerability**: JSON:API PATCH requests may bypass validation for certain fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Access bypass due to insufficient validation of input data in JSON:API PATCH requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially modify data they shouldn't have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted JSON:API PATCH request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send requests to the JSON:API endpoint. The `read_only` setting under `jsonapi.settings` must be set to `FALSE`, which is not the default. They must also have user-level access.
