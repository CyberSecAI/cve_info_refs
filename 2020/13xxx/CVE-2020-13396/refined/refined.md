    "description": "An issue was discovered in FreeRDP before 2.1.1. An out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability has been detected in ntlm_read_ChallengeMessage in winpr/libwinpr/sspi/NTLM/ntlm_message.c.",
    "affected_versions": "FreeRDP before 2.1.1",
        "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds read in the `ntlm_read_ChallengeMessage` function due to missing length checks when reading data from the stream.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read"

    "impact": "An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the client's memory, and cause denial of service due to a crash.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted NTLM Challenge Message to the FreeRDP client. Single low privileged user",
