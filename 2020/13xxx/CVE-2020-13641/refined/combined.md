## Description

This plugin allows you to dynamically (i.e. at the time when a page is generated) replace code and text from themes and other plugins with code and text of your choosing before a page is delivered to a user‚Äôs browser.

Because the find and replace happens in real-time no changes are needed to plugins or themes which means upgrades remain easy!

A [pro version](https://infolific.com/technology/software-worth-using/real-time-find-and-replace-for-wordpress/#pro-version) (a lifetime license is less than $15) with additional filtering options, setting export/import functionality, and the ability to modify admin pages is available.

Here are some common uses:

1. Want to selectively translate text that is being output by another plugin? You can do that.
2. Trying to tweak the text on a product or shopping cart page? No problem.
3. Hoping to remove footer text from a theme without modifying the theme? That‚Äôs easy.

Here are some [more examples](https://infolific.com/technology/internet/handiest-wordpress-plugin-youve-never-heard-of/).

And some [tips for those interested in on-page SEO](https://infolific.com/technology/internet/wordpress-seo-with-real-time-find-and-replace-plugin/).

Remember, all of the above can be done WITHOUT modifying themes or plugin files so you‚Äôll always be able to upgrade them without having to worry about losing custom edits.

  Interface for specifying the find and replace rules you‚Äôd like to use. Some elements are enabled in the [pro version](https://infolific.com/technology/software-worth-using/real-time-find-and-replace-for-wordpress/#pro-version).

## Installation

1. Upload the real-time-find-and-replace folder to the ‚Äò/wp-content/plugins/‚Äô directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress
3. The find and replace rules are in the Tools sidebar menu.
4. Click on the Add link on the Find and Replace admin page to add as many rules as you want.

## FAQ

### Where is data stored?

In an array in the wp\_options table. Just one record regardless of the number of find and replace rules.

### Will the find and replace slow my site?

Unless you‚Äôre using 50+ rules, you shouldn‚Äôt notice any performance impact. And if you‚Äôre using a caching plugin, even more rules won‚Äôt slow your site.

### What does the regex checkbox do?

You can do a straight up find and replace where the plugin will look for an exact match of what you specified. You can also used advanced pattern matching that is available through regular expressions by checking the regex checkbox.

### My web site is showing a blank page. What do I do?

This will happen if you are using a rule with regex enabled and the rule has an error. Regex is tricky so I recommend starting with a simple rule and adding to it to perform the replace you want.

This plugin is easy to configure and does exactly what it says. It can change page content, before the browser creates the page. I needed to redirect a link to another website, and this plugin did it without issue. I also had to change the domain I‚Äôd registered the pro version to, and Marios support was great.
Definitely will recommend and use this plugin again.

This was the third find-and-replace plugin I‚Äôd tried, and I was about to give up with the whole idea. But unlike the previous two, this one actually worked. (Specifically, I wanted to change the color of some sub-headings, on a site that has nearly a thousand blog posts.)
Thank you!

Works realtime and can parse regex
Handy note:use / or ~ start AND end, use \1 \2 etc to replace with the ( ) groups

We have a few plugins that don‚Äôt give the option to change terms and headings, so this plugin is perfect for removing standard e-commerce terminology and replacing it with terms for our sector (education).

# High Severity Vulnerability Patched in Real-Time Find and Replace Plugin

On April 22, 2020, our Threat Intelligence team discovered a vulnerability in [Real-Time Find and Replace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/real-time-find-and-replace/), a WordPress plugin installed on over 100,000 sites. This flaw could allow any user to inject malicious Javascript anywhere on a site if they could trick a site‚Äôs administrator into performing an action, like clicking on a link in a comment or email.

We reached out to the plugin developer on April 22, 2020, and they released a patch just a few hours after we disclosed the vulnerability to them. This is considered a high-severity security issue, therefore we strongly recommend an immediate update to the latest version available, which at the time of writing is version 4.0.2.

Both Wordfence Premium and Free Wordfence users are protected from XSS attempts against this vulnerability by the Wordfence firewall‚Äôs built-in XSS protection.

**Description:** Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting

**Affected Plugin:** [Real-Time Find and Replace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/real-time-find-and-replace/)

**Plugin Slug:** real-time-find-and-replace

**Affected Versions:** <= 3.9

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-13641](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13642)

**CVSS Score:** 8.8 (High)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 4.0.2

Real-Time Find and Replace provides functionality to dynamically replace any HTML content on WordPress sites with new content without permanently changing the source content. The replacement data loads immediately before it is delivered to the user‚Äôs browser. The plugin is very easy to use due to its limited functionality.

To provide this functionality, the plugin registers a sub-menu page tied to the function `far_options_page` with a capability requirement to ‚Äú`activate_plugins`.‚Äù

```
 function far_add_pages() {
	$page = add_submenu_page( 'tools.php', 'Real-Time Find and Replace', 'Real-Time Find and Replace', 'activate_plugins', 'real-time-find-and-replace', 'far_options_page' );
	add_action( "admin_print_scripts-$page", "far_admin_scripts" );
```

The `far_options_page` function contains the core of the plugin‚Äôs functionality for adding new find and replace rules. Unfortunately, that function failed to use nonce verification, so the integrity of a request‚Äôs source was not verified during rule update, resulting in a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability.

```
function far_options_page() {
	if ( isset( $_POST['setup-update'] ) ) {
		$_POST = stripslashes_deep( $_POST );

		// If atleast one find has been submitted
		if ( isset ( $_POST['farfind'] ) && is_array( $_POST['farfind'] ) ) {
			foreach ( $_POST['farfind'] as $key => $find ){
```

Any attacker capable of tricking a site owner into executing an unwanted action could replace any content or HTML on a vulnerable site with new content or malicious code. This replacement code or content would then execute anytime a user navigated to a page that contained the original content.

An attacker could use this vulnerability to replace a HTML tag like `<head>` with malicious Javascript. This would cause the malicious code to execute on nearly every page of the affected site, as nearly all pages start with a `<head>` HTML tag for the page header, creating a significant impact if successfully exploited. The malicious code could be used to inject a new administrative user account, steal session cookies, or redirect users to a malicious site, allowing attackers the ability to obtain administrative access or to infect innocent visitors browsing a compromised site.

![](https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-27-at-10.27.48-AM-300x150.png)

Example of `<head>` HTML tag being replaced with Javascript.

In the most up to date version, a nonce has been added along with a `check_admin_referer` nonce verification function to ensure the legitimacy of the source of a request.

```
function far_options_page() {
	if ( isset( $_POST['setup-update'] ) ) {
        check_admin_referer( 'far_rules_form' );
		$_POST = stripslashes_deep( $_POST );

		// If atleast one find has been submitted
		if ( isset ( $_POST['farfind'] ) && is_array( $_POST['farfind'] ) ) {
			foreach ( $_POST['farfind'] as $key => $find ){
```
# Disclosure Timeline

**April 22, 2020** ‚Äì Initial discovery and analysis of vulnerability. We verify the Wordfence built-in XSS firewall rule is sufficient. Initial outreach to plugin developer.

**April 22, 2020 8:51 AM UTC** ‚Äì Developer responds confirming appropriate inbox.

**April 22, 2020 9:34 AM UTC** ‚Äì We provide the full disclosure.

**April 22, 2020 1:30 PM UTC** ‚Äì We receive notification that patch has been released.

# Conclusion

In today‚Äôs post, we detailed a Cross-Site Request Forgery flaw in the Real-Time Find and Replace plugin. This flaw has been fully patched in version 4.0.2. We recommend that users update to the latest version, which is available immediately. Sites running [Wordfence Premium,](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20200427&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) as well as sites using the free version of Wordfence, are protected from Cross-Site Scripting attacks against this vulnerability due to the Wordfence firewall‚Äôs built-in protection. If you are aware of a friend or colleague using this plugin, we recommend you forward this security advisory to them as soon as possible to help secure their site.

# Real-Time Find and Replace

## Description

This plugin allows you to dynamically (i.e. at the time when a page is generated) replace code and text from themes and other plugins with code and text of your choosing before a page is delivered to a user‚Äôs browser.

Because the find and replace happens in real-time no changes are needed to plugins or themes which means upgrades remain easy!

A [pro version](https://infolific.com/technology/software-worth-using/real-time-find-and-replace-for-wordpress/#pro-version) (a lifetime license is less than $15) with additional filtering options, setting export/import functionality, and the ability to modify admin pages is available.

Here are some common uses:

1. Want to selectively translate text that is being output by another plugin? You can do that.
2. Trying to tweak the text on a product or shopping cart page? No problem.
3. Hoping to remove footer text from a theme without modifying the theme? That‚Äôs easy.

Here are some [more examples](https://infolific.com/technology/internet/handiest-wordpress-plugin-youve-never-heard-of/).

And some [tips for those interested in on-page SEO](https://infolific.com/technology/internet/wordpress-seo-with-real-time-find-and-replace-plugin/).

Remember, all of the above can be done WITHOUT modifying themes or plugin files so you‚Äôll always be able to upgrade them without having to worry about losing custom edits.

## Screenshots

  Interface for specifying the find and replace rules you‚Äôd like to use. Some elements are enabled in the [pro version](https://infolific.com/technology/software-worth-using/real-time-find-and-replace-for-wordpress/#pro-version).

## Installation

1. Upload the real-time-find-and-replace folder to the ‚Äò/wp-content/plugins/‚Äô directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress
3. The find and replace rules are in the Tools sidebar menu.
4. Click on the Add link on the Find and Replace admin page to add as many rules as you want.

## FAQ

### Where is data stored?

In an array in the wp\_options table. Just one record regardless of the number of find and replace rules.

### Will the find and replace slow my site?

Unless you‚Äôre using 50+ rules, you shouldn‚Äôt notice any performance impact. And if you‚Äôre using a caching plugin, even more rules won‚Äôt slow your site.

### What does the regex checkbox do?

You can do a straight up find and replace where the plugin will look for an exact match of what you specified. You can also used advanced pattern matching that is available through regular expressions by checking the regex checkbox.

### My web site is showing a blank page. What do I do?

This will happen if you are using a rule with regex enabled and the rule has an error. Regex is tricky so I recommend starting with a simple rule and adding to it to perform the replace you want.

Using this plugin feels like being a wizard! We mostly use it to correct SEO problems caused by plugins and it works like a charm EVERY time! Thank you for this great tool! üôÇ

This plugin is easy to configure and does exactly what it says. It can change page content, before the browser creates the page. I needed to redirect a link to another website, and this plugin did it without issue. I also had to change the domain I‚Äôd registered the pro version to, and Marios support was great.
Definitely will recommend and use this plugin again.

This was the third find-and-replace plugin I‚Äôd tried, and I was about to give up with the whole idea. But unlike the previous two, this one actually worked. (Specifically, I wanted to change the color of some sub-headings, on a site that has nearly a thousand blog posts.)
Thank you!

Works realtime and can parse regex
Handy note:use / or ~ start AND end, use \1 \2 etc to replace with the ( ) groups

We have a few plugins that don‚Äôt give the option to change terms and headings, so this plugin is perfect for removing standard e-commerce terminology and replacing it with terms for our sector (education).
