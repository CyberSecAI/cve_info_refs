The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13561.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a missing size check when processing a malformed TIFF file. Specifically, an out-of-bounds write occurs within the `memset` function due to attacker-controlled values read from the TIFF file's index record.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Out-of-bounds write: A write operation occurs outside the boundaries of the allocated buffer.
    - Missing input validation: The size of data being written is not properly checked against the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted, malformed TIFF file to the vulnerable application, which will then attempt to parse the file, triggering the out-of-bounds write.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the vulnerable application. This could involve tricking a user into opening a malicious file or providing it as an input to a service that processes TIFF files.
