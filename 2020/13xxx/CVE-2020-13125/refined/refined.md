Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of two vulnerabilities in separate plugins:

1.  **Ultimate Addons for Elementor:** A registration bypass vulnerability that allows unauthorized creation of subscriber-level user accounts.
2.  **Elementor Pro:** An authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability that can be exploited by subscriber-level users to achieve remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Ultimate Addons for Elementor:** Registration bypass vulnerability (CVE-2020-13125) allowed attackers to register subscriber-level users even when registration was disabled on the WordPress site.
*   **Elementor Pro:** Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-13126) allowed registered users to upload arbitrary files, leading to Remote Code Execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Combined impact:** Attackers first used the vulnerability in Ultimate Addons to create a user account. Then, they exploited the Elementor Pro vulnerability with this new account to upload malicious files. This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing attackers to install backdoors/webshells, gain full admin access, and/or delete the entire site.
*   **Ultimate Addons for Elementor (CVE-2020-13125):** Attackers could create subscriber level user accounts without any authorization.
*  **Elementor Pro (CVE-2020-13126):**  Allows registered users to upload arbitrary files leading to Remote Code Execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** Both vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely over the network.
*   The Ultimate Addons for Elementor vulnerability allowed attackers to create a subscriber level user. After creating a subscriber level user, the attacker was able to exploit the Elementor Pro vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ultimate Addons for Elementor:** No special capabilities are required; attackers can exploit this vulnerability without prior authentication.
*   **Elementor Pro:** Requires a registered user account. Attackers could either target sites with open user registration or exploit the vulnerability in the Ultimate Addons for Elementor to create a subscriber-level account.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability in Elementor Pro is a zero-day, meaning it was actively exploited before a patch was available.
*   The Wordfence blog mentions that the Elementor team was working on a patch at the time of the blog, and a patch has since been released.
*   The attack was actively targeting websites using these plugins.
*   The Wordfence blog provides indicators of compromise such as unknown subscriber-level accounts, files named "wp-xmlrpc.php," or files within the `/wp-content/uploads/elementor/custom-icons/` directory.

**Mitigations:**
* Update Ultimate Addons for Elementor to version 1.24.2 or greater.
* Update Elementor Pro to version 2.9.4 or greater.
* Deactivating Elementor Pro will mitigate the file upload vulnerability but will remove its features.
* Check for unknown subscriber-level users, remove malicious files such as "wp-xmlrpc.php", and delete any files located in /wp-content/uploads/elementor/custom-icons/ directory.
