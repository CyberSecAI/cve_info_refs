Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-13867:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from `targetcli-fb` having weak default permissions for the `/etc/target` directory, the backup directory within it, and the backup files generated by the `saveconfig` command. This means that these files and directories could be accessed or modified by users who should not have permissions to do so.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Default Permissions:** The core weakness is the overly permissive default permissions assigned to the configuration directory (`/etc/target`) and its contents. The backup directory and the configuration files should have more restrictive permissions.
*   **Unrestricted Access to Configuration Data:** Weak permissions on the configuration files in `/etc/target`, specifically `saveconfig.json`, could potentially expose sensitive configuration details to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information contained within the configuration files.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, the Gentoo advisory mentions privilege escalation. This could be achieved by modifying the configuration files, potentially leading to further attacks on the system. However, this vector is mitigated due to file creation with 0600 permissions.
*   **Denial of Service (indirect):** As reported in the Suse bugzilla entry, incorrect directory permission handling may lead to the system behaving strangely.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have access to the system where `targetcli-fb` is installed.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker could exploit the weak permissions to directly read/modify the config files, especially if they have access to a local account with some level of privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must be able to access the file system where the configuration data and backups are stored, specifically the `/etc/target` directory.
*   **No Root Privileges Required Initially:**  An attacker does not necessarily require root privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The issue is that once they do gain access, they can read potentially sensitive configuration data.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix involved ensuring that the `/etc/target` directory and backup files have the correct permissions when they are created by `targetcli-fb`. The backup files are set to 0o600. The directories should have 0700 or 0755 to prevent non-authorized users to list its content and get access to the backup files.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by setting the correct permission when creating the files and the directories.
*   The patch also addresses an issue where the tool would attempt to modify the permissions of a parent directory if a save file was stored outside of the /etc/target. This would lead to breaking system functionality and unexpected behaviours.

The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in `targetcli-fb` version 2.1.53 and later.
