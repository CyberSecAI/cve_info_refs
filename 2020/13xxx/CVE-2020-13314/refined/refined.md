  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `google_auth2/omniauth_error` endpoint in GitLab renders arbitrary error messages provided in the `error` parameter of the URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Content spoofing vulnerability due to the ability to inject arbitrary error messages into the page.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can display manipulated or malicious messages to users, potentially leading to user confusion, phishing attacks, or misrepresentation of the organization or individual.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a URL with a malicious message in the `error` parameter and tricking users into accessing this URL.",
