- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A negative value is passed to `malloc` in `bmp_load` leading to a crash when `jfif_encode` attempts to read from address `0x0`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer overflow or improper handling of image dimensions in the `bmp_load` function leads to a negative size being passed to `malloc`.
    - Null pointer dereference in `jfif_encode` at jfif.c:748 due to the failed malloc.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS). The program crashes due to a segmentation fault.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted BMP image file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious BMP image file to the vulnerable program (`ffjpeg`) for processing.
