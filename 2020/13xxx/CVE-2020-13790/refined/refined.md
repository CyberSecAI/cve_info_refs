  "CVE-2020-13790": {
    "Additional Information": "The provided documents contain more detailed information than the official CVE description, including specific code locations and affected functions.",
    "Root cause": "A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists due to incorrect handling of malformed PPM files in the `rdppm.c` file, specifically in the `get_rgb_row()` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking when processing PPM files.",
      "Insufficient validation of maximum pixel value in binary PPM files."
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful attack could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, potentially causing information disclosure or a crash of applications using the vulnerable `libjpeg-turbo` library. This can be triggered when processing a maliciously crafted PPM image file.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By enticing a user to open a crafted PPM file using an application linked against libjpeg-turbo.",
       "Through network access by processing a malformed PPM file."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed PPM file to the application. This can be achieved through various means like network access or by convincing the user to open such a file.",
    "Affected components": [
      "`rdppm.c` file, specifically in the `get_rgb_row()` function",
      "cjpeg program",
      "`tjLoadImage()` function",
      "TurboJPEG Java API"
    ]
  }
