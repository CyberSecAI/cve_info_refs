### CVE-2020-13247
**Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data when constructing CSV files, specifically within the user's name parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSV Injection/Formula Injection: Malicious formulas/macros can be injected into CSV files by manipulating user profile data (specifically the user name field)
- Lack of input validation/sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user input when constructing CSV files.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Remote code execution: When the CSV file is opened with spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, the injected macro can be executed, potentially leading to remote code execution at the client's system.
- Data leakage: Malicious hyperlinks injected in the CSV can cause data leakage.
- System damage: Arbitrary code execution can potentially cause damage to the administrator's PC

**Attack vectors**:
- The attacker modifies their user name to include a malicious macro (e.g., `=cmd|' /C calc'!A1 Smith`).
- The administrator exports user activity logs in CSV format.
- The administrator opens the CSV file with Microsoft Excel, triggering the execution of the injected macro.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- Any authenticated user can modify their name and inject malicious content.
- Requires a privileged user (administrator) to export and open the CSV file.
