  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The json-sanitizer library failed to properly escape HTML comment start (`<!--`), comment end (`-->`), and `<script` tags within JSON strings that were later embedded in HTML <script> elements. This could lead to the HTML parser misinterpreting where the script element ends.",
      "Weaknesses": "Improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in JSON strings, leading to XSS and potential script disabling.",
      "Impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML tags and Javascript code, potentially leading to XSS. It could also be used to selectively disable scripts by causing syntax errors or to bypass nonce-based Content Security Policies (CSPs).",
      "Attack vectors": "By controlling a substring of the input JSON that is embedded in an HTML <script> element, and also controlling another substring adjacent to the <script> element.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the content of a JSON string that is embedded within a `<script>` tag, and also control another substring adjacent to the `<script>` tag. The user also needs to interact with the malicious site."
    }
  ],
    "Additional_notes": "The provided content provides more detail than the official CVE description. The vulnerability can lead to a bypass of nonce-based CSP by injecting code after a script end tag."
