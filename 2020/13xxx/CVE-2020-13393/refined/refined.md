The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13393.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Tenda router's web server (httpd).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The `deviceId` and `time` parameters from a POST request are directly copied into a local stack variable using `strcpy` without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overwrite the return address of the function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided PoC can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Attackers can construct a payload to overwrite the return address and gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the device's web server.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests with controlled `deviceId` and `time` parameters.
