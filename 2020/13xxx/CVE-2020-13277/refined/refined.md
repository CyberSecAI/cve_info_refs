```
{
  "Root cause": "When a mirrored project with 'Trigger pipelines for mirror updates' enabled exists within a group, and the group owner deletes their account (while another owner remains in the group), the pipeline triggered by the mirror update is executed as the other owner. The pipeline is triggered by mirror updates from the attacker-controlled project.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "The system incorrectly attributes the pipeline execution to the victim user when a mirrored project triggers a pipeline after the original owner's account is deleted."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary pipeline jobs with the permissions of a victim user, gaining access to private repositories, member-only repositories, and the registry using the victim's CI_JOB_TOKEN.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The attacker creates a public project with a malicious .gitlab-ci.yml file.",
    "The attacker creates a public group and a project within that group.",
     "The attacker sets up a mirror of the attacker-controlled project to the group project with 'Trigger pipelines for mirror updates' enabled.",
    "The attacker invites the victim user as an owner to the group.",
     "The attacker deletes their account while another owner role is present."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "The attacker needs to be able to create projects and groups.",
    "The attacker needs to be able to mirror projects.",
    "The attacker needs to be able to invite other users to their group as owners.",
    "The attacker needs to be able to delete their own account.",
     "The attacker needs to have knowledge of a victim user"
  ]
