{
  "Root cause": "The application allows users to set an unconfirmed email address as their notification email address.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Users can set an unconfirmed email address as their notification email address, bypassing the email verification process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can add an unverified email and set it as the notification email. This allows the attacker to send large quantities of emails (spam) to many users using the notifications feature without verifying ownership of the email address.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the GitLab user settings page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account on Gitlab, navigate to the User Settings -> Emails page and add a new unconfirmed email. Then navigate to User Settings -> Notifications page and set the unconfirmed email address as the notification email address."
