- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `do_write_op_tlv` function in the Zephyr LwM2M implementation enters an infinite loop when encountering a TLV entry that is not one of the expected types, because it does not handle unexpected types.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to an infinite loop, a CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote denial of service (DoS). The affected device becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop, affecting the availability of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote adversary that can inject LwM2M messages is able to trigger the vulnerability, causing a DoS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to inject LwM2M messages to the target device. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability. The attack complexity is low and does not require user interaction.
