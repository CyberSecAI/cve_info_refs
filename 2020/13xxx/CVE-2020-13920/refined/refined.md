Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13920:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Apache ActiveMQ uses `LocateRegistry.createRegistry()` to create the JMX RMI registry and binds the server to the "jmxrmi" entry. The registry does not require authentication for connection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated access to the JMX RMI registry.
- The ability to call the `rebind` method on the JMX RMI registry without authentication.
- This allows an attacker to rebind the "jmxrmi" entry to a malicious server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is possible.
- An attacker can intercept credentials when a user connects to the JMX service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs network access to the ActiveMQ instance.
- The attacker connects to the vulnerable JMX RMI registry.
- The attacker uses the rebind method to point the "jmxrmi" entry to their server.
- When a user attempts to connect to the JMX service, they will be routed to the attacker's server, enabling credential interception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable ActiveMQ instance.
- The ability to create a malicious JMX RMI server.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apache ActiveMQ versions prior to 5.15.12.
- Debian LTS advisories DLA-2400-1 and DLA-3657-1 address this vulnerability in the `activemq` package.
- The provided content contains more details than the official CVE description, specifying the attack vector and the potential for credential interception.
