- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the WinRing0x64 driver, specifically due to improper privilege management in handling IRP 0x9c406144, which allows low-privilege users to directly access the `HalGetBusDataByOffset` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper Privilege Management: The driver allows a low-privilege user to directly interact with `HalGetBusDataByOffset`, which provides access to sensitive hardware information.
    - Information Disclosure: The `HalGetBusDataByOffset` function is used to query information from I/O busses (USB and PCI), which can leak sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from USB and PCI devices by querying I/O busses. This information could include hardware IDs and other sensitive details about the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) with control code 0x9c406144 to the `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` driver. This allows an unprivileged user to trigger the information disclosure.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low-privilege access to the system in order to send the malicious IRP to the vulnerable driver.
