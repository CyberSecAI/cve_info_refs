Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization in the `showAlert()` function within the Bludit administration panel. This function directly renders user-supplied text, making it susceptible to code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the message box, which will then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the `showAlert()` function is called.
- **HTML Injection:** The vulnerability also allows for HTML injection, as the function doesn't sanitize HTML tags. This could be used to modify the page's structure or appearance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing user credentials
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the web page
- **HTML Manipulation:** An attacker can modify the structure and content of the admin page potentially leading to phishing attacks or disguising malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Injection:** An attacker could directly call the `showAlert()` function, providing malicious javascript in the `text` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the Bludit administration panel where they can trigger the `showAlert()` function.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must know that the `showAlert` function is vulnerable to code injection.

**Technical Details:**
The provided code snippet details the following:
- The vulnerable function is `showAlert()`.
- The attacker used the payload `showAlert("<script>alert(1)</script>");` to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in Bludit versions 3.x.
- The proof of concept was included in a public repo with images.
