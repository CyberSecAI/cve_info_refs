{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient permission checks when editing badges. A user with 'Maintainer' role on a project can modify group-level badges, even when they do not have explicit permissions at the group level.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Improper authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "A project maintainer can modify group-level badges without having the necessary group-level permissions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct API manipulation using PUT request"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have 'Maintainer' access to a project within the group and knowledge of the group badge ID. They must also be able to craft and send HTTP PUT requests to the API."
