Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an oversight in GitLab's API access control implementation for deploy tokens. Group maintainers, who should not have the authority, were able to create and delete group-level deploy tokens via the API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is a broken access control mechanism where the API did not properly enforce the intended permissions, allowing group maintainers to perform actions (creating and deleting deploy tokens) that should have been restricted to group owners only.
*   **API Misconfiguration:** The API endpoints for creating and deleting deploy tokens were accessible to group maintainers, whereas the UI only allowed group owners to perform these actions, highlighting a discrepancy in permission enforcement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Token Management:** Group maintainers could create deploy tokens, potentially granting unauthorized access to resources within the group's repositories.
*   **Denial of Service/Data Manipulation:**  Group maintainers could delete deploy tokens, disrupting legitimate workflows relying on these tokens for CI/CD pipelines, or potentially disrupting other integrations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Exploitation:** The attack vector is the GitLab API. Attackers, with group maintainer privileges, could use the documented API endpoints to create and delete deploy tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Group Maintainer Role:** The attacker needs to have "Maintainer" role within a GitLab group to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **API Knowledge:** The attacker also needs to be aware of the specific API endpoints for deploy token management and have the API token for the maintainer account.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability allowed group maintainers to create and delete deploy tokens via the API, a function that should only be available to group owners. This was due to a broken access control mechanism in the API. The impact of this vulnerability includes unauthorized access through created tokens, and disruption via token deletion.
