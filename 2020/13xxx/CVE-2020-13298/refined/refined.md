  "CVE-2020-13298": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of file names in the Conan packages API, specifically related to how the Grape framework handles regular expressions and requirements. The regex for validating Conan file names could be bypassed by adding extra characters. Additionally, the `FILE_NAME_REQUIREMENTS` validation seems to be ignored, possibly due to a bug in Grape, allowing for further bypass.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Regex bypass: The regular expression used to validate file names in the Conan packages API could be bypassed by appending additional characters to the file name, such as `conanfile.pytestsetsetsetsetsetsetsetest/./.`.",
       "Requirement bypass: Due to a potential bug in the Grape framework, the `FILE_NAME_REQUIREMENTS` validation is ignored, allowing for file names like `conanfile.py.git%2fgit-upload-pack` to pass the validation.",
      "Workhorse bypass: The Workhorse component performs URL cleaning before applying predefined rules. This cleaning combined with the previous bypasses, allowed an attacker to craft a malicious URL which bypassed workhorse checks and resulted in access to arbitrary files on the server."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass Workhorse and leverage the UploadedFile functionality to disclose arbitrary files on the GitLab server within the allowed path. This allows for sensitive information to be leaked.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafting a malicious POST request to the Conan packages API with a specially crafted file name parameter. This crafted filename can bypass multiple validation layers in the API, which allows an attacker to specify a target file path via the `file.path` parameter and cause the server to upload file content to the specified path. The content of the specified file is then available through the package registry.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid API token and knowledge of the project structure to craft the malicious requests. They must also be able to send HTTP requests to the GitLab instance."
