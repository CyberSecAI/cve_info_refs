      "A user can create a deploy key for a project, which can then be used to access private files in a project they are not a member of, provided that the project is public and only allows repository access to members."

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a member of at least one project, and that project needs to have a deploy key associated with it. The attacker also needs to know the existence of the target project."
