- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WinRing0x64 driver in NZXT CAM software allows low-privilege users to directly access the `MmMapIoSpace` function using IRP 0x9c406104. This function can read physical memory within the range 0xC0000-0xFFFFF, which often stores sensitive information such as BIOS or motherboard firmware.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269): The driver grants low-privilege users access to a kernel function (`MmMapIoSpace`) that should be restricted.
  - Information Disclosure: By accessing and reading physical memory, sensitive data can be leaked.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read sensitive information from the system's physical memory, such as BIOS or motherboard firmware. This information could potentially be used for further attacks or exploitation.

- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) with the code 0x9c406104 to the `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` driver.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the system where the vulnerable NZXT CAM software and its WinRing0x64 driver are installed.
