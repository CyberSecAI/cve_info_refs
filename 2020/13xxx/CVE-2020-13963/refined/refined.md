Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The "remember me" feature in SOPlanning uses a cookie to maintain user sessions. The cookie is generated by hashing the user ID and date with a secret key.
- The secret key for the admin user is hardcoded in the database installation script.
- The guest user has no key set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Hardcoded Secret Key:** The use of a hardcoded secret key for the admin user makes it easily predictable.
- **Missing Secret Key:** The lack of a secret key for the guest user makes it possible to forge a valid cookie without any secret.
- **Authentication Bypass:** These flaws allow an attacker to forge a valid cookie for both the admin and guest users, bypassing the normal authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can gain access to SOPlanning as either the admin or guest user without requiring valid credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This bypass can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and administrative functions, depending on which account is compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is the ability to forge a cookie with a predictable secret key or no key for the guest account. This allows an attacker to directly log in to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to know the hardcoded key, or simply understand that no key is used for the guest account.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft an HTTP request that contains a crafted cookie.
- No prior access to the application is needed and the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability affects SOPlanning versions 1.45 to 1.46.
- The issue was reported to the vendor on 7/Jun/2020 and fixed on 21/Jul/2020 in version 1.47
