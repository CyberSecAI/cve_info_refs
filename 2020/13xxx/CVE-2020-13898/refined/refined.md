Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `janus_sdp_process` function within the `sdp.c` file of the janus-gateway project. Specifically, a NULL pointer dereference can occur during the parsing of SDP attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a pointer without ensuring it is not NULL, leading to a crash when the pointer is NULL. The specific location is when parsing the `mid` attribute in `janus_sdp_process` function, if the `a->name` or `a->value` is NULL it will crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause the janus-gateway server to crash, leading to a denial of service. This can interrupt communication services provided by the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted SDP:** An attacker can send a specially crafted SDP offer/answer to the server which triggers the NULL pointer dereference during parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send SDP messages to the janus-gateway server. This typically means that they must be a peer connecting via WebRTC.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can trigger the vulnerability through standard communication channels with the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `sdp.c` file, specifically in the `janus_sdp_process` function when handling the `mid` attribute.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mikhail Evdokimov at Digital Security dsec.ru.
- The fix for this issue was included in pull request #2214.
- The `mid` attribute is parsed in the loop going through the attributes in `m-lines`
- The vulnerable code is located in line 120 and 123 of the `sdp.c` file.

The provided information indicates that a malicious actor can cause a NULL pointer dereference in the SDP parsing logic, leading to a denial of service.
