Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13901:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** that occurs within the `janus_sdp_merge` function in the `sdp.c` file of the `janus-gateway` project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** This type of vulnerability arises when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overwriting data on the stack, an attacker could potentially overwrite the return address of a function, which would allow the attacker to redirect the program's execution to an address of their choosing. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if the attacker does not achieve code execution, a buffer overflow can crash the application, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted SDP:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) message to the `janus-gateway` server. The crafted SDP will trigger the vulnerability when the `janus_sdp_merge` function attempts to merge it with other SDP data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the `janus-gateway` server to deliver the malicious SDP.
- **Knowledge of SDP format:** The attacker must be familiar with the structure and encoding of SDP messages to craft one that exploits the vulnerability.
- **Intermediary or direct connection to Janus:** The attacker could be directly connected to the Janus server, or an intermediary, such as a compromised client in a peer-to-peer connection, may be used.
