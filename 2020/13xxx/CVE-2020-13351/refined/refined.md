```json
{
  "CVE-2020-13351": {
    "Root cause": "The API endpoint for retrieving a single pipeline schedule (`/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/pipeline_schedules/<schedule_id>`) exposed the custom variables and their values associated with the schedule to unauthorized users, despite the intended security model that should have restricted access to owners and masters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authorization bypass",
      "Information exposure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthorized users could read scheduled pipeline custom variables and their values. This could lead to hijacking of schedules.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a GET request to the API endpoint `/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/pipeline_schedules/<schedule_id>` with a valid access token, even if the user is not a member of the project.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs a valid GitLab access token."
  }
