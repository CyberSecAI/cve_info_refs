# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1151

## Win-911 mobile server platform privilege escalation vulnerability

##### January 4, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13541

### Summary

An exploitable local privilege elevation vulnerability exists in the file system permissions of the Mobile-911 Server V2.5 install directory. Depending on the vector chosen, an attacker can overwrite the service executable and execute arbitrary code with System privileges or replace other files within the installation folder that could lead to local privilege escalation.

### Tested Versions

Win-911 Mobile Server V2.5

### Product URLs

<https://www.win911.com/products/mobile/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-276 - Incorrect Default Permissions

### Details

WIN-911 Mobile delivers critical SCADA/OT, HMI and control networks alerts to mobile devices in real time. It supports various methods of alert configuration, routing and escalation designed to ensure safety of the environment.

By default, Mobile-911 Server V2.5 is installed in “c:\Program Files (x86)\WIN-911 Software\Mobile-911 Server” directory and it allows “Everyone” group to have “Change” privilege over certain files in the directory which are executed with SYSTEM authority. This allows any user on the system to modify arbitrary files in the install directory resulting in privilege escalation.

```
c:\program files (x86)\win-911 software\mobile-911 server\Mobile911.Server.exe
                                                                               Everyone:C
																			   BUILTIN\Administrators:F
																			   NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(ID)F
																			   BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
																			   BUILTIN\Users:(ID)R
																			   APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(ID)R
																			   APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APP PACKAGES:(ID)R

```

In addition, library files loaded by the service can also be replaced to gain privileged access into the primary Mobile911.Server service executed as Local System:

```
c:\Program Files (x86)\WIN-911 Software\Mobile-911 Server\Mobile911.Common.dll
                                                                               Everyone:C
																			   BUILTIN\Administrators:F
																			   NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(ID)F
																			   BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
																			   BUILTIN\Users:(ID)R
																			   APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(ID)R
																			   APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APP PACKAGES:(ID)R

c:\Program Files (x86)\WIN-911 Software\Mobile-911 Server\System.Data.SQLite.dll
                                                                                 Everyone:C
																				 BUILTIN\Administrators:F
																				 NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(ID)F
																				 BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
																				 BUILTIN\Users:(ID)R
																				 APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(ID)R
																				 APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APP PACKAGES:(ID)R

c:\Program Files (x86)\WIN-911 Software\Mobile-911 Server\x64\SQLite.Interop.dll
                                                                                 Everyone:C
																				 BUILTIN\Administrators:F
																				 Everyone:(ID)C
																				 BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
																				 NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(ID)F
																				 BUILTIN\Users:(ID)R
																				 APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(ID)R
																				 APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APP PACKAGES:(ID)R

c:\Program Files (x86)\WIN-911 Software\Mobile-911 Server\x86\SQLite.Interop.dll
                                                                                 Everyone:(ID)C
