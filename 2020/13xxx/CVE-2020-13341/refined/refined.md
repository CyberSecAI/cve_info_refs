    "root_cause": "Insufficient type checking in the `find_object` method within the GraphQL mutation for deleting annotations. The method does not validate the type of the provided ID, allowing it to be used with other objects like Projects instead of just annotations.",

      "Insufficient type validation",
      "Improper authorization check bypass"
