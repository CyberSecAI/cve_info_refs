## **Description**

The application i-doit has one Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of input validation and output encoding.

## **PoC**

<script>alert("XSS")</script> was submitted in the app parameter "objID", but this could be injected into any parameter shown in the URL as shown below:

![](/content/images/vuln/idoit_1.png)

This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (see request below).

/idoit-open-1.14.2/?viewMode=1100&tvMode=1006&tvType=3&objID=3"<script>alert("XSS")</script>3&catgID=31&objTypeID=2&editMode=0

The following screenshot shows the JavaScript being executed on the client side:
