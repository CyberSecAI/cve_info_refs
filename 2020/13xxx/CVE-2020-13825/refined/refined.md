- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The i-doit web application lacks proper input validation and output encoding, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. Specifically, the value of the `app` request parameter is copied into the value of a Javascript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the browser of any user who views the relevant application content. This can lead to stealing session tokens, login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on behalf of the user, and logging keystrokes.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious JavaScript code through request parameters (e.g. `objID` parameter), which is then reflected in the application's response. The provided PoC uses the `objID` parameter. The vulnerability is present in any parameter shown in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload and induce a user to click the link. The attacker does not need any special privileges other than the ability to generate a URL. The user must interact with the malicious link for the XSS to execute.
