Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the DEXT5Upload component's handling of file uploads, specifically through the `dext5handler` handler. The application fails to properly validate or restrict uploaded file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files, including those with executable extensions like `.php`, `.jsp`, `.asp`, and `.aspx`.
- **Bypassed Extension Check:** The newly added `SetUploadCheckFileExtension()` function, intended to restrict file extensions, can be bypassed. The specific method of bypass is not described.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload a malicious script, enabling them to execute arbitrary code on the server. This gives the attacker complete control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack involves crafting a specific HTTP request to the `dext5handler` handler. This request includes parameters like `dext5CMD`, `fileToUpload` and `filename`, along with the malicious file itself.
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a malicious file with an executable extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the `dext5CMD`, `fileToUpload` and `filename` parameters used in the upload request.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of generating or modifying HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is DEXT5Upload version 2.7.1402870 and earlier.
- The provided content includes packet captures of the malicious upload request, the server response, and the successful execution of a webshell.
