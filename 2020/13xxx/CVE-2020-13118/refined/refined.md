Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `community` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the `community` parameter received from the GET request.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The SQL query is built by directly concatenating the user-supplied parameter, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Malicious actors could modify or delete data.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Depending on the context and database structure, attackers could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could use the SQL injection to cause the database to become slow or unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable `check_community.php` endpoint.
*   **Injected SQL Code:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `community` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's server.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker must have a working knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable File and Line:**  `check_community.php` line 49.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `$_GET['community']`.
*   **Vulnerable SQL Query:** `SELECT name from router where community='$community'`
*  **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates a time-based SQL injection using a `SLEEP()` function:
  ```
  http://192.168.178.132/check_community.php?community=1' AND (SELECT 6941 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Qaxg) AND 'sdHI'='sdHI
  ```
This PoC injects an SQL query that delays execution for 5 seconds, which indicates the vulnerability's presence.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The application uses `mysqli` for database interaction, which, if used correctly, can prevent SQL injection using prepared statements. However, in this case, it is used insecurely.
* The included `credentials.php` file may also be vulnerable if not properly secured, but this is not specified as part of this vulnerability.
