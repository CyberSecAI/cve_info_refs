  "CVE-2020-13131": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Yubico libykpiv before 2.1.0. lib/util.c in this library (which is included in yubico-piv-tool) does not properly check embedded length fields during device communication. A malicious PIV token can misreport the returned length fields during RSA key generation. This will cause stack memory to be copied into heap allocated memory that gets returned to the caller. The leaked memory could include PINs, passwords, key material, and other sensitive information depending on the integration. During further processing by the caller, this information could leak across trust boundaries. Note that RSA key generation is triggered by the host and cannot directly be triggered by the token.",
    "Root cause": "The `_ykpiv_get_length` function parses a length field from the smart card response, and the resulting length is used in a `memcpy` without any bounds checking. This allows a malicious smart card to report an excessively large length, leading to an out-of-bounds read from the stack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking on length fields received from a PIV token."
    ],
    "Impact": "Stack memory, potentially containing sensitive data like PINs, passwords, and key material, is copied into a heap-allocated buffer returned to the caller. This can leak sensitive information across trust boundaries.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious PIV token is required. The attacker needs physical access to the system to insert the malicious token. The vulnerability is triggered during RSA key generation, which is initiated by the host application.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to present a malicious PIV token to the target system and initiate an RSA key generation operation using vulnerable software (yubico-piv-tool)."
