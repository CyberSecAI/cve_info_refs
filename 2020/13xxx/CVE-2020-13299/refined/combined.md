# "remember\_user\_token" is not getting revoked - Attacker able to takeover victim account

**[HackerOne report #896225](https://hackerone.com/reports/896225)** by `vaib25vicky` on 2020-06-11, assigned to [@ngeorge1](/ngeorge1 "Nikhil George"):

### Summary

Gitlab user have a option to revoke active session which deletes the user session and prevent attacker to access his account. BUT the `remember_user_token` is not getting revoked and with the help of only this token one is able to login as well as able to create new `_gitlab_session` token.

### Steps to reproduce

(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)

* login as `testUser` and choose `remember me`option
* copy `remember_user_token` and open new browser or incognito window
* on new browser/incognito window login as `testUser` again
* from original browser/window delete active session by going over settings
* refresh new browser/incognito window , you'll see your session has been revoked
* Now, paste the `remember_user_token` and its value and refresh
* Voila, you are login as `testUser` again even when session get revoked.
* Go to cookies and you'll see a new `_gitlab_session` token has also been created.

### Impact

`remember_user_token` is not getting revoked - Attacker able to takeover victim account

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

`remember_user_token` is not getting revoked along with session token

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

`remember_user_token` should also get revoke along with session cookie beacuse then there is no point of revoking only session token. Attacker can again login to the victim account even when he has revoke the session and access his sensitive information or change his settings

### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

Please let me know if you need more info.

Cheers,

Vaibhav Singh

## Impact
