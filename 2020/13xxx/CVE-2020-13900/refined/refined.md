Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13900:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The provided content, particularly the GitHub Advisory Database entry and the commit message in the pull request, directly mention CVE-2020-13900 and its association with a NULL pointer dereference in the `janus_sdp_preparse` function within the `sdp.c` file of the janus-gateway project. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a potential NULL pointer dereference within the `janus_sdp_preparse` function in `sdp.c`. Specifically, the code attempts to access the `a->value` without ensuring that `a` or `a->name` are not NULL when parsing mid attributes in SDP m-lines.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the lack of proper NULL checks before accessing attributes. The code iterates through a list of attributes (`tempA`) but does not verify that the `a` pointer is valid before trying to access its members, `a->name` or `a->value`.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability would lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to the application crashing when a crafted SDP is processed.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted SDP containing a malformed attribute in an m-line. The attacker would need to send the malicious SDP to the Janus server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send an SDP to a Janus server. This could be an external peer in a WebRTC scenario or a malicious plugin.

**3. Technical Details (from code):**

The vulnerability is present in this code snippet from the provided `sdp.c`:
```c
GList *tempA = m->attributes;
while(tempA) {
    janus_sdp_attribute *a = (janus_sdp_attribute *)tempA->data;
    if(a->name) {
        if(!strcasecmp(a->name, "mid")) {
           ...
```
The vulnerability occurs because the code directly accesses `a->name` without checking if `a` itself is `NULL`. If a crafted SDP is provided where some attributes in the m-line do not have a valid attribute struct associated, then `a` could be `NULL` and dereferencing `a->name` will lead to a crash.

**4. Additional Notes:**
*   The provided commit log in the pull request ([#2214](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/pull/2214)) indicates that this vulnerability was fixed by adding checks to ensure `a` is not `NULL` before accessing its members.
*   The fix is within the same PR that fixes CVE-2020-13901, CVE-2020-13899, and CVE-2020-13898.

In summary, CVE-2020-13900 is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in `janus_sdp_preparse` due to missing checks before accessing SDP attribute data. An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted SDP containing malformed attributes to a vulnerable Janus server.
