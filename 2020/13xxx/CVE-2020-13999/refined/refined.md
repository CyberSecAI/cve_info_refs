Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13999

**Root Cause:**
- An integer overflow exists in the `ScaleViewPortExtEx` function within `libemf.cpp` of libEMF.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted EMF (Enhanced Metafile) file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted EMF file to an application using the vulnerable libEMF library. The application must then attempt to process the malicious file.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of this crafted EMF file via the `ScaleViewPortExtEx` function.
- The application would need to be compiled with the vulnerable version of libEMF.

**Additional Notes:**
- The libEMF library is used to generate Enhanced Metafiles on POSIX systems and is designed for use with graphics programs like Grace or gnuplot.
- The vulnerability is triggered during processing of malicious files, which means the attacker needs to have the ability to provide the crafted EMF file to software that uses libEMF.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in libEMF version 1.0.13.
