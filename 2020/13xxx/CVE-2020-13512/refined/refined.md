Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13512

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The WinRing0x64 driver in NZXT CAM 4.8.0 allows low-privilege users to directly execute `OUT` instructions to write to processor I/O ports without proper restrictions. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when an attacker sends a specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) with the IO control code `0x9c40a0d8`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The driver grants low-privilege users access to sensitive operations, specifically the ability to write to arbitrary processor I/O ports, which should be restricted to privileged code.
*   **Unrestricted `OUT` Instruction:** The driver does not validate or sanitize the data or destination of the `OUT` instruction, allowing a low privilege user to write to potentially any IO port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By writing to specific I/O ports, an attacker can gain elevated privileges on the system. The report states, "This access could be used for privilege escalation."
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution Potential:** Although not explicitly stated, this kind of access can often be leveraged further for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious IRP:** An attacker sends a specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) with the IO control code `0x9c40a0d8` to the `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` device, which is accessible to all users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the system.
*   **Ability to Send IRPs:** The attacker needs the ability to send I/O request packets to the driver's device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The report notes the vulnerability is present in other IRP codes as well, which are tracked as CVE-2020-13513 (writing a word) and CVE-2020-13514 (writing a dword).
*   The provided code snippets highlight the lack of validation before the `OUT` instruction is executed.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `WinRing0x64` driver and thus affects the NZXT CAM application.
*   The report is more detailed than the typical CVE description, showing the specific IRP codes, and the vulnerable instructions.
