Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `available_custom_project_templates` method within the `User` model uses a `ProjectsFinder` which does not properly check the user's access level to projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system fails to enforce the correct access level when retrieving available custom project templates.  Specifically, it doesn't check if a user has the required permissions (e.g., Repository, Issue, Snippets access) to use a project as a template.
- **Incorrect Permissions Check:** The `ProjectsFinder` uses an initial collection of projects accessible by the authenticated user, but it doesn't then filter based on the user's permissions for each project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A guest user can discover project templates they shouldn't have access to (projects that are public but have repository, issues, snippets access disabled for guests)

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `available_custom_project_templates` method on the `User` model.
- An authenticated user, specifically a guest user, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, specifically a guest user.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `available_custom_project_templates` method, likely within the GitLab interface.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content references GitLab issue [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/67109](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/67109) as the location for the initial description of the vulnerability, noting this is the second vulnerability described in that issue.
- The issue specifically states that the intended behavior is to limit projects returned based on the user's permissions, which it was not doing.
- The content also links to the CVE JSON file, implying that this vulnerability has been officially registered.
