# ESCALATED: available\_custom\_project\_templates does not check the access level of the user

This is the 2nd vulnerability described at <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/67109>

> This is where the second vulnerability can be found. The `ProjectsFinder` uses an initial collection, which consists of the projects the authenticated user can access. However, it does **not** check the access level of the user. This means that any project that is public, but has Repository, Issue, Snippets (etc.) access disabled for Guests, will be returned by the `available_custom_project_templates` method on the `User` model. In a perfect world, it seems that this method would limit the projects that can be returned based on the user's permissions for said projects.
