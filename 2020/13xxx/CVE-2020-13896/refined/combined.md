|  | The web interface of Maipu MP1800X-50 7.5.3.14(R) devices allows |
| --- | --- |
|  | remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the |
|  | form/formDeviceVerGet URI, such as system id, hardware model, hardware |
|  | version, bootloader version, software version, software image file, |
|  | compilation time, and system uptime. |
|  |  |
|  | The attacker just has to create a request to |
|  |  |
|  | http://routerip/form/formDeviceVerGet |
|  |  |
|  | and in the response the whole information about the router will be disclosed to the attacker. |
