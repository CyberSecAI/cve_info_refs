- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of bounds checking when accessing the `_paths` array in the `GetPath` method within the Pixar OpenUSD library. The index used to access this array is read directly from a user-supplied file, without any validation of whether the index is within the bounds of the allocated array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the `SdfPath` type is read from the `PATHS` section of the USD file using an index, with no check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the allocated `_paths` array.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to an information disclosure. By controlling the index, an attacker can read memory outside the bounds of the `_paths` array, which may contain sensitive information from the processâ€™ memory. This can aid in bypassing mitigations such as ASLR and further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted malformed USD file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide the malformed USD file to a victim who will then attempt to access/parse this file.
