The content is related to CVE-2020-13496.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check when accessing the `_tokens` array in the `GetToken` method of the `pxrInternal_v0_20__pxrReserved__::Usd_CrateFile::CrateFile` class when processing a USD file. The index used to access the array is read from the file without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code reads data from memory outside the bounds of the allocated `_tokens` array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially leak sensitive process information by reading out of bounds memory.
- Memory corruption: This could be used to achieve further memory corruption and control program execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted, malformed USD file to the victim.
- When the victim's application processes this file, the out-of-bounds read vulnerability is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a USD file, and have the victim access the file.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability other than ability to have the victim access a malformed file.
