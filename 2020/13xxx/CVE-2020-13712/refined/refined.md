- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A command injection vulnerability exists within the MGOS user interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as root.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system as the root user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the MGOS user interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the device and low-level user privileges to exploit the command injection vulnerability.
