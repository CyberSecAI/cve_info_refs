  "CVE-2020-13261": {
    "description": "Amazon EKS credentials leaked via HTML source code. The Amazon EKS cluster credentials are transmitted in plaintext to the GitLab frontend, where they are masked in the UI. However, the actual Amazon credentials remain stored in the HTML source code of the page. A malicious admin user can copy those credentials, and if removed from the GitLab instance, they still have full Amazon access. Furthermore, an XSS vulnerability can steal the Amazon credentials by reading the HTML page.",
    "root_cause": "The Amazon EKS credentials are transmitted in plaintext to the frontend and then masked there, leaving them in plain in the HTML source code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Plaintext storage of sensitive information in HTML source code.",
      "Exposure of Amazon EKS credentials."
    ],
    "impact": "The Amazon EKS credentials are leaked in the HTML source code allowing a malicious admin or an attacker exploiting an XSS vulnerability to gain full access to the Amazon account.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Directly accessing the HTML source code by a malicious admin.",
      "Exploitation of an XSS vulnerability to extract the HTML source code."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
        "Malicious admin user with access to the GitLab admin panel.",
        "Ability to execute XSS in the context of the vulnerable page."
     ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the admin panel where the Amazon EKS integration settings are configured. The secret access key is sent as a plaintext value within an HTML input element, even though it appears masked in the user interface."
