# GitLab-Runner on Windows `DOCKER\_AUTH\_CONFIG` container host Command Injection

**[HackerOne report #955016](https://hackerone.com/reports/955016)** by `ajxchapman` on 2020-08-10, assigned to [@ngeorge1](/ngeorge1 "Nikhil George"):

## Summary

GitLab-Runner, when running on Windows with a `docker` executor, is vulnerable to Command Injection via the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` build variable. Injected commands are executed on the container host, not within a Docker container, as such could compromise all future builds which are executed by the runner.

## Details

When using a `docker` executor, the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` build variable is processed as a JSON docker config file. One of the possible config values, `credHelpers`, specifies a hash of repository keys to docker Credential Helper application values.

```
{
  "credHelpers" : {
    "repo.example.com" : "application"
  }
}
```

When `gitlab-runner` attempts to create an image, each key value pair in the `credHelpers` hash is processed, and the corresponding Credential Helper application is executed by `gitlab-runner` in order to obtain credentials for the repository. This execution occurs on the docker container host, `gitlab-runner` directly `exec`s the Credential Helper to receive it's output.

Docker Credential Helpers, as processed by the `github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go:NewNativeStore` function are prepended with the string `docker-credential-` before execution:

```
// github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go
const (
	remoteCredentialsPrefix = "docker-credential-"
	tokenUsername           = "<token>"
)

...

func NewNativeStore(file store, helperSuffix string) Store {
	name := remoteCredentialsPrefix + helperSuffix
	return &nativeStore{
		programFunc: client.NewShellProgramFunc(name),
		fileStore:   NewFileStore(file),
	}
}
```

This is sufficient to prevent command injection on \*nix based systems, however Windows based systems can exploit path traversal to execute arbitrary programs as Credential Helpers. E.G. a `credHelper` of `{"helper" : :/../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/calc.exe"}` would result in the application `docker-credential-/../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/calc.exe` being executed, which on a Windows system would resolve to `C:/Windows/System32/calc.exe`. This only affects Windows based systems, as Windows does not verify path directories exist during path normalization. In this case, Windows does not check the directory `docker-credential-` exists as it is normalized out due to the path traversal characters following it.

The Credential Helper execution is ultimately called in the `gitlab-runner` code by `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/helpers/docker/auth/auth.go:readConfigsFromCredentialsHelper` calling the `github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go:Get` `docker` API method:

```
// gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/helpers/docker/auth/auth.go
func readConfigsFromCredentialsHelper(config *configfile.ConfigFile) (map[string]types.AuthConfig, error) {
	helpersAuths := make(map[string]types.AuthConfig)

	for registry, helper := range config.CredentialHelpers {
		store := credentials.NewNativeStore(config, helper)

		newAuths, err := store.Get(registry)
```

The issue exists as the `gitlab-runner` code does not check for path traversals in Credential Helper values before passing them to the `docker` API.

In it's simplest form, this issue can be exploited to execute any program that exists on the system running `gitlab-runner` with uncontrolled arguments. However, arbitrary programs can be executed by setting up a `service` which downloads an executable payload to the `C:\Builds` volume mounted directory, and setting the full path to the volume mounted directory as the `credHelper` value, e.g.:

```
{
  "helper" : "/../../../../../../../../ProgramData/docker/volumes/runner-aapjznsw-project-20444930-concurrent-0-cache-cde2929a41401004cf47d36bdb2eb380/_data/testfile.exe"
}
```

This works as the following three conditions are met:

1. The source of the volume mounted `build` directory is predictable per build
2. The `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` is processed once for each created container
3. The build container is created after all `service` containers have been started.

## Steps to reproduce

* Register and run a runner on a Windows system with a docker executor and a tag of `windows-docker-runner`.
* Create a Build with the following `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```
services:
  - alpasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfidne:3.5
variables:
  DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG: "{\"credHelpers\" : {\"repo.example.com\" : \"/../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/calc.exe\"}}"

build1:
  tags:
    - windows-docker-runner
  stage: build
  script:
    - whoami
```

When `gitlab-runner` picks up the build it will process the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` json and launch the CredentialHelper specified, in this case `calc.exe`.

Confirmed vulnerable version configurations are:

* gitlab-runner 13.2.2 on Windows 10 with Docker Toolbox (`docker` runner)
* gitlab-runner 13.2.2 on Windows 2019 with Docker Enterprise (`docker-windows` runner)

## Impact

Exploitation of this issue could compromise the underlying system on which `gitlab-runner` runs, exposing source code, build artifacts and other sensitive data to a malicious user.

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

gitlab-runner passes unsanitized JSON values from the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` build variable to the `github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go:NewNativeStore` `docker` API function, which may result in command injection on Windows systems.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

JSON supplied via the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` build variable should be processed to ensure it does not contain malicious content.
