Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the URL parameter "a" when displaying the login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application takes input from the URL parameter and directly reflects it within the HTML output, allowing for execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize the URL parameter before using it in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- Session Hijacking: The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
- Defacement: The attacker could manipulate the content of the login page, potentially displaying misleading or malicious information.
- Redirection: The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website.
- Other malicious actions: The attacker could perform other malicious actions depending on the user's permissions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL: An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the "a" parameter.
- Social Engineering: The attacker tricks the victim into clicking the malicious URL through phishing or other social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft URLs: The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to be able to trick a victim into clicking the malicious link.
- No direct access to the target server is required.
