Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13268:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `file.path` parameter within the group import API in GitLab. Specifically, the API attempts to read the file specified by `file.path` from the server's local file system during the import process.  It does perform a basic check using `File.realpath` and `start_with?` to ensure the path is within allowed directories, but this check is performed after `File.exist?`, which allows for file enumeration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Enumeration:**  The `File.exist?` check in `lib/uploaded_file.rb` allows an attacker to probe the existence of files on the server. By sending requests with different `file.path` values, an attacker can determine if a file exists based on the response (either "insecure path used!" if the path exists and is within allowed directories, or "500 Internal Error" otherwise).
*  **Potential Remote Object Storage Access (file.remote_id):**  The vulnerability also exists in the handling of `file.remote_id` which may expose the application to SSRF attacks, depending on the configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can enumerate files on the server's filesystem, potentially revealing sensitive configuration files, application code, or other confidential data. This includes reading the file contents if it's located in `/tmp`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Group Import API:** The vulnerability is exploited through the group import API endpoint.
*   **`file.path` Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `file.path` parameter to probe the existence of files on the server's file system.
*   **`file.remote_id` Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially manipulate the `file.remote_id` to access files on remote object storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a GitLab user with the ability to create groups and access the group import API (requires a valid API token).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the GitLab server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on HackerOne (report #848415).
*   The provided code snippets from `lib/api/group_import.rb` and `lib/uploaded_file.rb` detail the vulnerable logic.
* The issue also applies to Gitlab.com
