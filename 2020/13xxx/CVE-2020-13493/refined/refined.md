The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence, and it directly relates to CVE-2020-13493.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Pixar OpenUSD when parsing compressed sections of binary USD files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of sizes when decompressing data for the `PATHS` section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in how the software handles compressed data within the `PATHS` section of the USD file format. The software reads a size value (`jumpsSize`) from the file, which is then used in a `ReadContiguous` operation to read a specific number of bytes. However, the allocated buffer (`compBuffer`) for this operation has a size determined by a different value (`numPaths`) previously read from the file. There is no check to ensure that `jumpsSize` does not exceed the allocated buffer size determined by `numPaths`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. Because the attacker controls the overflow size and the overflow content, this can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the system running vulnerable software.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted malformed USD file. The attacker provides a file where the `jumpsSize` value is larger than the allocated buffer based on `numPaths`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to provide the malformed file to a victim using the vulnerable software (Pixar OpenUSD). The victim needs to open or process the attacker-provided file in order to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are needed.
