Based on the provided JSON content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the CI/CD Pipeline view of GitLab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The vulnerability stems from the CI/CD Pipeline view.
-  The system improperly restricts access to pipeline variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A user with access to CI/CD pipelines in a project can view sensitive information by accessing variables from other pipelines within the same project. This can include credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data stored as variables.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious user with access to CI/CD pipelines within a GitLab project.
- The attacker leverages the CI/CD Pipeline view to access variables associated with other pipelines within the same project.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker must have a user account with access to view CI/CD pipelines within a GitLab project.
-  No elevated privileges are explicitly required beyond the standard CI/CD pipeline access.

**Affected Versions:**
- GitLab versions 11.10 through 13.0 are affected.
