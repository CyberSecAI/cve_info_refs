Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13756:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `eval()` function in the `allSelectors` method of `lib/Sabberworm/CSS/CSSList/CSSBlockList.php`. This function constructs a string containing user-supplied data (`$sSpecificitySearch`) which is then executed by `eval()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Code Injection: The primary vulnerability is a code injection. The `eval()` function interprets a string as PHP code which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- Uncontrolled Data: The `$sSpecificitySearch` variable, which is used in the `eval()` statement, is influenced by user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Request Parameter: The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how the `$_GET['n']` parameter can be controlled by the attacker and used to inject malicious code in the `eval` statement, by crafting a URL that includes PHP code.
- Data Input: Any mechanism that allows an attacker to control or influence the data passed to the `$sSpecificitySearch` variable can be an attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- Data Control: The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `sSpecificitySearch` variable, either directly or indirectly.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions prior to the listed fixed versions which range from 1.0.1 to 8.3.1
- The fix involves removing the use of `eval()` and replacing it with a safer way of comparing specificity, as seen in the provided code diff.
