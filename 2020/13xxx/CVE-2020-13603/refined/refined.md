Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `sys_mem_pool_alloc` function within the Zephyr RTOS. This function is a wrapper for the `malloc` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The `sys_mem_pool_alloc` function calculates the memory to allocate using `size + WB_UP(sizeof(struct sys_mem_pool_block))` without proper checks for integer overflows.
*   When a very large size value is requested (e.g., 0xffffffff), an integer wrap-around occurs during the addition. This results in a much smaller value being used for the memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploitation leads to a heap overflow.
*   An attacker can request a large memory allocation which, due to the integer overflow, results in a small allocation. Subsequent writes to the allocated memory can overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a variety of issues including code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by calling the `malloc` function or its wrapper `sys_mem_pool_alloc` with a large size argument that will cause the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to call the `malloc` function or related memory allocation functions with attacker controlled size parameters.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Zephyr versions 1.14.2 and 2.4.0
*   The fix was applied in pull requests #31796 (for v2.4) and #32808 (for v1.14).
*   The vulnerability has a "Moderate" severity rating.
*   The vulnerability is also identified with the weakness: CWE-190.
