- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The document details multiple vulnerabilities stemming from hardware design and implementation flaws in various microcontrollers, specifically related to debug interfaces, memory access control, and power management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **D1-A: Load Instruction Exploitation**: In CKS32F103 and GD32VF103, load instructions are not properly blocked when a debugger is present, allowing for firmware extraction via crafted instructions executed by the CPU.
    - **D1-B: Extraction via Exceptions**: STM32F103, APM32F103 and CKS32F103 expose flash memory content through interrupt vector fetches when a debugger is connected. The instruction bus is not blocked, enabling attackers to leak flash memory by manipulating the VTOR register and generating exceptions.
    - **D1-C: VTOR Control Flow Redirection**: GD32F103 allows for control flow redirection through manipulation of the Vector Table Offset Register(VTOR) when the CPU debug module is disabled. An attacker can write a flash memory dumping firmware in SRAM and trigger the NMI.
    - **D2: DMA Access Exploitation**: CKS32F103 and GD32F103 have vulnerabilities where the DMA module can still read from flash memory while a debugger is attached, enabling extraction via DMA transfers.
    - **H1: Invasive Data Eavesdropping**: GD32 series (GD32F103 and GD32F130) with dual-die designs are vulnerable to physical eavesdropping of QSPI communication between the logic and flash memory dies via exposed bonding wires.
    - **H2: Invasive RDP Manipulation**: GD32F130's security is circumvented by manipulating the address of the QSPI transaction loading the option bytes during startup via single bonding wire.
     - **H3: Shellcode Exec. via Glitch and FPB**:  APM32F103 and STM32F103 can be compromised via a power glitch, which allows a temporary access to flash, combined with exploitation of the FPB unit for control flow redirection, leading to a privileged shellcode execution.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized extraction of 100% of the firmware from all tested devices, exposing valuable data and intellectual property.
    - Ability to gain full control of the target microcontroller, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
    - Circumvention of security mechanisms (RDP levels).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Debug Interface**: Exploiting vulnerabilities through the JTAG/SWD debug interface.
    - **Physical Attacks**: Direct access to the microcontrollerâ€™s die and its interconnects via decapping and probing.
    - **Power Glitching**: Manipulating the power supply to cause unexpected behavior in the microcontroller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Debug Interface Access**: Debugger tools and software to communicate with the microcontroller's debug interface.
    - **Basic Electronics Skills**: For hardware-based attacks, some basic knowledge and tools like a hot plate, sulfuric acid, sandpaper, logic analyzer, thin wires and conductive paint are needed.
    - **Power Glitch Setup**: Ability to create a precise power glitch and control the microcontroller's power supply.
    - **Timing Control**: Precise timing control for some attacks, e.g., glitch attacks or QSPI manipulation using a development board running optimized code.
    - **Knowledge of the Device Architecture**: Understanding how the device's memory map, CPU core, and peripherals function is necessary to craft effective exploits.
