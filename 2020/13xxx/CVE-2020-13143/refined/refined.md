Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13143:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper handling of string lengths in the USB gadget subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store` function in `drivers/usb/gadget/configfs.c` uses `kstrdup` to copy user-provided data into a buffer, relying on the size of the user provided data, `len`. However, if the user-provided data contains an embedded null byte, `kstrdup` will stop copying at the null byte, resulting in a smaller allocated buffer, but the subsequent code accesses it as if its size was equal to the user-provided length `len`, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds write**: The primary vulnerability is a heap-based out-of-bounds write caused by `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store` accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer. This happens when the size of the allocated buffer is smaller than the expected size.
- **Lack of validation**: The code lacks proper validation of the input string length prior to memory allocation using `kstrdup` and during subsequent memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service due to a kernel crash or memory corruption.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation**:  The reports indicate a potential for privilege escalation, although the exact mechanism for this is unclear. The out-of-bounds write could be leveraged to overwrite critical kernel data structures.
- **Information Leak**: In some cases, it's also stated that a local attacker could expose sensitive information due to memory access issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a local attacker with the ability to write to the gadget configuration filesystem. This usually involves access to the device node for the USB gadget configuration filesystem.
- The SUSE information also mentioned that a remote user can trigger the vulnerability, due to the lack of check on input parameter `len`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local user access:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the permissions to write to the USB gadget configuration filesystem. The Debian advisory notes a local user must be permitted to write to the gadget configuration filesystem and the NetApp advisory indicates that the local user must have a low level of privileges.
- **Arbitrary data writing**: The attacker needs to be able to write arbitrary data to the specific configfs files related to the USB gadget configuration.
- **SUSE information notes the attacker needs CAP_NET_ADMIN**: The SUSE advisory says that the attacker needs the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability, which might be needed for the exploit on some configuration but not required for initial trigger of the bug.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel versions 3.16 through 5.6.13.
- The fix involves checking the length of the string before memory access, specifically by comparing `strlen(page)` to the user provided `len`.
- Various distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE) have addressed this vulnerability through kernel updates.
-  The NetApp advisory highlights that multiple NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability which could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

In summary, CVE-2020-13143 involves a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's USB gadget subsystem that can be exploited by a local user with the ability to write to the gadget config filesystem. This results in a potential for denial of service, possible privilege escalation, and information leak. The root cause is due to improper string length validation which occurs due to `kstrdup` returning early on embedded null bytes in user input.
