The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13539.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect default file system permissions in the Win-911 Enterprise V4.20.13 install directory. Specifically, the "Everyone" group has "Full" control over certain executable files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **CWE-276 - Incorrect Default Permissions:** The vulnerability stems from the overly permissive file system permissions granted to the "Everyone" group on specific executables within the Win-911 installation directory.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting these weak permissions, a local attacker can overwrite legitimate executables with malicious ones.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** When the replaced executables are run by the system or a privileged user, the attacker's code executes with the elevated privileges of that user or service (SYSTEM in case of CVE-2020-13539, WIN-911 service user in case of CVE-2020-13540)

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local file system manipulation:** An attacker with local access can overwrite the vulnerable executables.
- **Executable replacement:** The attacker substitutes the original executables with malicious code

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Win-911 Enterprise is installed.
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need administrator privileges to overwrite the files, as the "Everyone" group has write access.
