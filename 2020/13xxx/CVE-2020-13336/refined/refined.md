{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the injection of malicious code within the Sentry error tracking data, specifically within the `colNo` field of the stacktrace. When Gitlab renders this data, it executes the injected JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform any action within the application that a user can perform, steal sensitive user data, and steal user's credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the Sentry error tracking data by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `colNo` field of a stacktrace. This modified data is then displayed by GitLab on the Error Tracking page, triggering the XSS vulnerability when the page is rendered.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to modify the error data that is sent to Sentry. They also need a Sentry project connected to Gitlab."
