- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `id` parameter in the `forms_fields_rules/rules` page is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization/filtering. The unsanitized `id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious actions. The impact is rated as having low confidentiality and integrity impact and no availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/crm/index.php?module=forms_fields_rules/rules&action=get_fields_choices` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated or trigger the vulnerability through cross-site request forgery. Authentication can be done with administrator credentials.
