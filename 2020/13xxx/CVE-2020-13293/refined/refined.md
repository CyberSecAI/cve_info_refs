      "Git allows branch names that are identical to commit hashes.",

    "impact": "An attacker can create a branch with a name identical to a commit hash. If a user attempts to check out the commit using its hash, Git will check out the attacker-controlled branch instead. This can result in the user checking out malicious code instead of the intended commit.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor creates a branch with the same name as a commit hash and pushes it to a repository. If another user attempts to check out the commit using its hash, Git will instead checkout the attacker's malicious branch."
