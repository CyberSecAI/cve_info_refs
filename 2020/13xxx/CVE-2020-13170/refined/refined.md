{
  "CVE-2020-13170": {
    "vulnerability": "When token replication is not enabled in a secondary datacenter, attempts to use a local token created in the primary are successful for operations targeting that secondary datacenter. Thus what was meant to be scoped to a single datacenter is valid in other datacenters.",
    "root_cause": "Local tokens, intended to be valid only within a single datacenter, are incorrectly resolved and used in remote datacenters when token replication is not enabled.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect scope validation of local ACL tokens",
      "Improper enforcement of token replication requirements"
    ],
    "impact": "A local token created in one datacenter can be used in another datacenter, potentially allowing unauthorized access to resources in the remote datacenter, violating the principle of least privilege.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with a valid local token in one datacenter can use it to perform operations in other datacenters where the token should not be valid.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs a valid local ACL token from a primary datacenter."
  },
  "CVE-2020-12797": {
    "vulnerability": "Consul doesn't enforce changes to legacy ACL tokens rules due to not being propagated to secondary data centers.",
    "root_cause": "An internal conversion process when updating legacy ACL tokens does not compute a necessary field, preventing rule changes from being replicated to secondary datacenters.",
    "weaknesses": [
       "Incomplete legacy ACL token replication",
       "Improper handling of legacy ACL token updates"
    ],
    "impact": "Changes to legacy ACL token rules in the primary datacenter are not enforced in secondary datacenters, potentially leading to unauthorized access if the secondary datacenters are still using older, less restrictive rulesets.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with a legacy token that has been updated with more restrictions in the primary datacenter can still use the older, less restricted token in secondary datacenters.",
     "attacker_capabilities":"Attacker needs a valid legacy ACL token in a primary datacenter, where the rules have been updated."
