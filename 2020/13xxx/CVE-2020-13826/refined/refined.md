- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of input validation and output encoding when exporting object data to CSV files. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the exported CSV files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSV Injection vulnerability (CWE-434).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious code into CSV files, which when opened by a user, can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. Additionally, this can allow exfiltration of data from the spreadsheet or other opened spreadsheets.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious payloads into object parameters within the i-doit web application. The application then exports the content, including the injected malicious payload, into a CSV file. When the user opens this CSV file, the injected code is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Low privileges required. The attacker needs the ability to create/modify objects within the i-doit web application. User interaction is required as the victim needs to open the crafted CSV file.
