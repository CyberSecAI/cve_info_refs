## **Vulnerability Details**

| **CSV Injection Vulnerability in i-doit 1.14.2** | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Severity**: **Medium** | **CVSS Score**: 6.5 | **CWE-ID**: [**CWE-434**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434) | **Status**: Not Fixed |
| **Vulnerability Description** | | | |
| The i-doit web application is affected by CSV Injection vulnerability affecting version 1.14.2 and probably prior versions. An attacker can use the vulnerability to inject malicious code into CSV files in order to gain control over the user's computer, taking advantage of the user's tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets they have downloaded from their own website and exfiltrate the contents of the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets. | | | |
| **CVSS Base Score** | | | |
| **Attack Vector** | Network | **Scope** | Changed |
| **Attack Complexity** | Low | **Confidentiality Impact** | Low |
| **Privileges Required** | Low | **Integrity Impact** | Low |
| **User Interaction** | Required | **Availability Impact** | Low |

## **Description**

The application i-doit allows to export the content of the objects created in a CSV file, which allowed an attacker to inject malicious code due to the lack of input validation and output encoding.

## **PoC**

The objects' parameters are copied and exported in CSV files that can be interpreted by the affected user's computer. The payload =cmd|' /C calc 'A0 was submitted as the name of the title object, as shown below:

The code is stored without modifications, and the application allows to download the control and configuration of the objects in CSV format.
