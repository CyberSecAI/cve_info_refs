Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing of compressed string tokens within binary USD files by Pixar OpenUSD. Specifically, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs when the code attempts to extract null-terminated strings from a decompressed buffer. The code does not check if the string parsing remains within the bounds of the decompressed buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** The core issue is that the parsing code reads past the end of the allocated buffer for string tokens if a malformed file provides a `numTokens` value that exceeds the actual number of null-terminated strings in the decompressed data. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** There is no validation to ensure the string extraction process stays within the boundaries of the decompressed buffer, resulting in potential read operations beyond the intended memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Reading out-of-bounds memory can leak sensitive information residing in adjacent heap areas. This could include heap metadata or other process-related data, potentially exposing internal program details or enabling the bypass of security mitigations such as ASLR.
- **Application Crash:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash if the accessed memory is not valid, or if it triggers memory protection mechanisms.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Information leak can be abused to defeat exploitation mitigations such as ASLR and help with further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious USD File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted, malicious USD file. This file contains a `TOKENS` section with a manipulated `numTokens` value that is larger than the number of actual strings in the decompressed data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malformed File:** The attacker needs to provide the victim with a malformed USD file for processing. This implies a social engineering attack, supply chain vulnerability or other means to get the file to the target.
- **User Interaction (Indirect):** The user must somehow open or process the malicious USD file using a vulnerable application to trigger the flaw. On MacOS, this can be achieved via thumbnails rendering of the USD file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was specifically found in Pixar OpenUSD version 20.05
- The vulnerability affects applications that parse USD files, including those using ModelIO framework on macOS and iOS.
- The report contains detailed code snippets and crash information, which can be used for further research and analysis.
