The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13651.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DigDash application allows users to inject content into a JNLP file. This file is used to run a local Java application, specifically a Java applet. The injection vulnerability allows the attacker to modify the URL contacted by the Java applet for authentication and updates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Content injection
- Insecure handling of JNLP files
- Lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input in JNLP file generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can modify the JNLP file, forcing the user's Java stack to retrieve and execute a malicious JAR file. This leads to arbitrary code execution on the user's computer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker modifies the `ddserver` parameter within the URL of the JNLP file request.
- The server generates the JNLP file including the modified malicious server URL.
- When the user loads the malicious JNLP file, their Java stack connects to the malicious server instead of the legitimate DigDash server.
- The malicious server provides a modified JNLP file pointing to a malicious JAR file which is then downloaded and executed on the user's computer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a request containing the malicious parameter to the server hosting the vulnerable DigDash application.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
