```
(CVE) ID: CVE-2020-13974
```

Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13974:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `k_ascii` function within the Linux kernel's virtual terminal (vt) keyboard driver (`drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c`). The vulnerability occurs when the `npadch` variable, representing a number assembled on the keypad, grows too large due to repeated multiplication with the `base` variable, exceeding the maximum value of an integer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Integer overflow: The `k_ascii` function lacks proper overflow checks when calculating the value of `npadch`, leading to an integer overflow if the assembled number becomes too large.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS): An integer overflow can crash the kernel, resulting in a denial of service.
*   Unspecified Impact: The original report suggested the possibility of an unspecified impact.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Local Access: A local attacker with access to a virtual terminal can trigger this vulnerability by sending a series of special characters to the keyboard input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Local user access with the ability to send crafted inputs to the virtual terminal.

**Additional information:**

*   The vulnerability was triggered via a modified version of syzkaller called "FuzzUSB".
*   The `npadch` variable was renamed to `npadch_value` and type is changed to unsigned int.  A `npadch_active` variable was also introduced to manage the state.
*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions 4.4 through 5.7.1.
*   The fix involves adding checks for integer overflows before the multiplication operations to prevent the `npadch` variable from exceeding the maximum value for an integer which could result in a crash of the system or have other unspecified impact.
*   The Suse information describes it as a low severity and states that they do not intend to fix it in the kernel-default packages. However, they did provide fixes for several products and packages.
*   Ubuntu states that "A local attacker could possibly use this to have an unspecified impact."

The provided information appears to provide a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability, exceeding the official CVE description.
