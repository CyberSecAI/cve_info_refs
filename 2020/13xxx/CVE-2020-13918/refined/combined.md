[Unleashed and Multi-Site Manager](/products/82-unleashed-and-multi-site-manager)

**Ruckus Unleashed** enables controller-less Wi-Fi architecture for small business environments with superior performance, lower costs and simplified management. Separate controllers and access point licenses are no longer needed, significantly reducing up-front costs. With a simplified web interface deploying Unleashed is very easy.

Ruckus Unleashed is custom-designed to help small business owners grow their business, deliver an excellent customer experience and manage costs while supporting Wi-Fi and a variety of mobile devices with minimal IT staff.

Unleashed access points have built-in controller capabilities, including user access controls, guest networking functions, advanced Wi-Fi security and traffic management. Smart Mesh is available on all but H320/R3xx model APs. As businesses grow to multiple sites or a larger scale deployment, Ruckus offers an easy migration path to controller based Wi-Fi, using the same Wi-Fi access point.

**Ruckus Unleashed Multi-Site Manager (UMM)** is a new NMS platform for Unleashed, ZoneDirector, P300 bridges. If you have Unleashed networks deployed across multiple small sites, Unleashed Multi-Site Manager is the one-stop solution for management, monitoring and reporting. It is a complete management platform that is intuitive and easy to use. It enables Unleashed networks to be securely monitored and managed from anywhere in the world with a single sign-on.

[ZoneDirector 1200](/products/73-zonedirector-1200)

With simplicity and ease of use in mind, the RuckusZoneDirector 1200 is purpose-built to address the gap between standalone, feature-deficient access points (APs) that must be individually managed and the costly, complex high-end enterprise systems that are overkill for most small business environments.

The Ruckus ZoneDirector 1200 can be deployed and operated by non-wireless experts and installed quickly and easily. Any organization with limited IT staff and budget can create a robust and secure multimedia WLAN in a matter of minutes.

This controller is focused on small to medium enterprise business, which scales up to 150 AP’s, 4,000 client devices, and 256 WLANs.  The ZD 1200 works with the ZoneFlex AP’s to deliver a highly reliable and easy to manage Wi-Fi network. The pay as you grow licensing system allows you to start with a standard license for 5 AP’s and grow to a maximum of 150 AP’s with a granularity of one AP license.
