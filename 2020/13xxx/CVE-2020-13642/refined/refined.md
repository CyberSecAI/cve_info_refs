Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of nonce protection in two functions within the "Page Builder by SiteOrigin" WordPress plugin:

1.  **Live Editor Preview:** The `live-editor-preview.php` file renders content based on the `live_editor_panels_data` POST parameter without verifying the request's origin. Although capability checks exist, the absence of nonce verification allows for CSRF attacks.
2.  **AJAX Builder Content:** The `action_builder_content` function, which is triggered by the `wp_ajax_so_panels_builder_content` AJAX action, processes content submitted via the `panels_data` POST parameter without nonce validation. This allows attackers to forge requests and inject malicious content into the editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Due to the lack of nonce verification, an attacker can forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious JavaScript code through the "Custom HTML" widget (in the first case) or the "Text" widget (in the second case), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the administrator's browser when they access a crafted page.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The plugin processes user-supplied widget data without proper sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious code. Specifically, the "Text" widget allows for the unfiltered injection of JavaScript when using its text mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Site Takeover:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the WordPress site, as an attacker can leverage the XSS to create new admin accounts, inject backdoors, redirect administrators, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in an administrator's browser.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerabilities could potentially be leveraged to alter content on the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** Attackers need to craft a malicious link or page that an administrator clicks or accesses while being logged into their WordPress site.
*   **XSS:** Malicious JavaScript is injected through crafted widget data in the `live_editor_panels_data` or `panels_data` parameters. The code is then executed when the page renders or is processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into clicking a malicious link or opening a crafted page (social engineering).
*   No specific capabilities are required beyond the ability to craft HTTP requests and malicious JavaScript code.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated with the target site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The first vulnerability leads to reflected XSS because the malicious data is not stored in the database, it is only reflected back to the user.
*   The second vulnerability can lead to XSS even with sanitization, because the "Text" widget allows for unfiltered input when switching to text mode.

**Affected Versions:**
*   <= 2.10.15

**Patched Version:**
*   2.10.16

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13642 is associated with the `live-editor-preview.php` flaw, while CVE-2020-13643 is associated with the `action_builder_content` flaw.
