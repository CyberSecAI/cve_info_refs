- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference in the `HTTPsReq_HdrParse` function within the Micrium uC-HTTP server. This occurs when the `FormCfgPtr` structure is not initialized at compile time, leading to `FormBoundaryPtr` remaining NULL. Consequently, when the code later attempts to write to memory pointed to by `FormBoundaryPtr`, a NULL pointer dereference occurs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of NULL pointer checks before dereferencing `FormCfgPtr` and `FormBoundaryPtr`. Specifically, when processing multipart content, the code does not verify that memory has been allocated for `FormBoundaryPtr`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The server crashes, preventing it from handling further requests.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request that includes a Content-Type header specifying multipart data, which causes the server to attempt to process the form data using a NULL pointer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication or special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
