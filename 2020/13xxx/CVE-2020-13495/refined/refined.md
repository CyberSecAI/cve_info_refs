The provided content describes CVE-2020-9973, not CVE-2020-13495.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Pixar OpenUSD handles file offsets in binary USD files. Specifically, the software does not validate that offsets used to seek to different sections within a file are within the bounds of the memory-mapped file. These offsets are read directly from the file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of bounds checking on file offsets when seeking within memory-mapped files.
- The vulnerability enables arbitrary memory read due to the ability to control the seek offset.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary memory locations within the process's address space.
- This can lead to sensitive information disclosure which could aid in bypassing mitigations like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), and potentially assist further exploitation.
- The vulnerability can also be used to probe the memory layout.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted malformed USD file.
- The victim needs to access or open this attacker-provided file.
- This can happen when a user views a 3D scene in applications using the ModelIO framework (such as in macOS and iOS) or through other programs utilizing the OpenUSD library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious USD file containing attacker controlled offset values.
- The attacker needs to be able to make the victim open the crafted malicious file.
