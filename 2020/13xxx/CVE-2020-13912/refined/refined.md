Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13912:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient authorization and/or rights management in the SolarWinds "Advanced Monitoring Agent" software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The "Advanced Monitoring Agent" software (prior to version 10.8.9) was executed each time a user logged into the system (either remotely or locally).
- The agent's executable file had permissions that allowed any user on the system to modify it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious user could replace the legitimate agent's executable with a modified version.
- This modified version would then execute arbitrary commands under the context of the user logging in. This would allow for privilege escalation to the level of any user that logs in after the file is replaced.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local or remote attacker who has access to modify files on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify files on the target system.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious executable in the location that is used by the monitoring agent.
