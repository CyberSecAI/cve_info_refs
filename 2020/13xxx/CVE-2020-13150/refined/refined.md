Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-13150:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- After a restart of the D-Link DSL-2750U router (P/N: ISL2750UEME3.V1E, Firmware Version: ME\_1.03), there is a window of approximately 90 seconds before MAC address filtering rules become active. This delay allows unauthorized access to the router's control panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability**: The device doesn't immediately enforce MAC filtering rules upon restart.
- **Insecure access control**: Allowing access to the control panel during the boot-up process before MAC filtering is applied.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Bypassing access restrictions:** An attacker can gain access to the router's control panel even if their MAC address is blocked by the filtering rules, during the boot up process.
- **Potential unauthorized configuration changes**: Once access to the control panel is achieved, an attacker can modify router settings.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Network Access**: The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable D-Link router.
- **Physical Restart**: The attacker would need to trigger a physical restart of the router.
- **Timing-based attack**: The attacker needs to access the control panel within the 90-second window after the device restart.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have physical or network-level access to the D-Link device.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerability, and the timing window during startup.
- The attacker must be able to connect to the router's network (WiFi in this case).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was confirmed by D-Link Corporation.
- The security bulletin link for D-Link is provided.
- The vulnerability was discovered by idris SI-AHMED.
