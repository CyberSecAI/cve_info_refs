Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure direct object reference within the `acf-to-rest-api` WordPress plugin. The plugin's logic allows manipulation of permalinks using the `$_GET` parameter, leading to the ability to read arbitrary data from the WordPress `wp_options` table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin does not properly validate the 'id' and 'field' parameters in the `/wp-json/acf/v3/options/` endpoint, allowing attackers to directly access data by manipulating these parameters via the URL.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `$_GET` parameter, allowing the attacker to specify arbitrary keys in the `wp_options` table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the `wp_options` table, including:
    *   Admin email addresses
    *   Mail server login credentials (username and password)
    *   Active plugins
    *   Potentially other sensitive configuration data
*   **Account Takeover (indirect):** By retrieving login and password information, an attacker could potentially use this data for further malicious activities on the targeted WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the 'id' and 'field' parameters within the URL's query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without any prior access to the WordPress system.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL parameters.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/wp-json/acf/v3/options/a`.
*   The attacker manipulates the URL with `?id=<option_name>&field=<option_field>`
*   Example attack URL: `/wp-json/acf/v3/options/a?id=mailserver&field=pass`
*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the plugin up to and including 3.1.0.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `fb9859c5c2f7c0e375cf86e39bce0629f673e52b`.
