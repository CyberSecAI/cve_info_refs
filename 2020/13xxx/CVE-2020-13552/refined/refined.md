Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is incorrect default permissions on multiple service executables and their associated files within the Advantech WebAccess/SCADA installation directory. These files and directories have weak permissions, allowing any authenticated user to modify or replace them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file system permissions assigned to critical executables and libraries. Specifically, the "Users" group has read and write access, while "Authenticated Users" group has change access, allowing any authenticated user to replace these files with malicious versions.
*   **Service Executable Replacement:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to replace the legitimate executables of various services (e.g., `SC-tool-keep-alive.exe`, `mongod64.exe`, `grafana-server.exe`, `SC-Management-Go.exe`, `InfluxDB.exe`, `influxd.exe`) with malicious ones.
*   **DLL Sideloading:** The vulnerability also allows an attacker to replace DLLs loaded by these services, which can be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By replacing the executables or DLLs with malicious versions, an attacker can gain NT SYSTEM level privileges when the service starts or loads the modified file.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker requires local access to the machine running Advantech WebAccess/SCADA to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **File Replacement:** The attacker would need to overwrite the legitimate executables or DLLs with their malicious replacements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the system, as the weak permissions grant write access to authenticated users, not just administrators.
*   **Local Access:** Physical or remote access to the target system is required.
