Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13467:

**Summary**
This CVE relates to a vulnerability found in the GD32F103 microcontroller. The vulnerability allows an attacker to extract the entire firmware by redirecting the control flow using the VTOR register. This vulnerability is exploitable with a debugger present in RDP level 1.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect implementation of security measures when a debugger is present. While direct reads to flash memory are blocked via debugger, the instruction bus remains accessible. This allows control flow to be manipulated via the VTOR register.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The instruction bus allows interrupt vector fetches even when the debug interface is active in RDP Level 1.
- The VTOR (Vector Table Offset Register) can be modified to point to arbitrary locations in memory.
- The CPU debug module can be disabled, but other system level components (SRAM and peripherals) remain accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full firmware extraction
- Complete compromise of the device's security
- Potential for reverse engineering of the firmware
- Intellectual property theft

**Attack Vectors:**
- Debug interface access is required.
- Manipulation of the VTOR register.
- Triggering of a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access to the microcontroller.
- Debugging interface and tools (e.g., a debugger)
- Understanding of the device architecture and registers, especially the VTOR and interrupt handling.
- Ability to load code into SRAM
- Ability to manipulate debug registers.
- The device needs to be in RDP level 1.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker first disables the CPU debug module (C_DEBUGEN bit in DHCSR).
- The attacker then loads a flash dumping firmware into SRAM.
- The VTOR is updated to point to the flash dumping firmware in SRAM.
- A Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) is triggered which forces the CPU to jump to the NMI handler which is the flash dumping firmware.
- The flash dumping firmware runs in privileged mode and can access flash memory.
- The entire firmware is extracted via UART.

**Additional Notes:**
The paper also notes that the GD32F103 has a DMA vulnerability (CVE-2020-13465) that can also be used for firmware extraction, and that the GD32F130 uses bit permutation as a weak security measure, leading to another vulnerability (CVE-2020-13468).
