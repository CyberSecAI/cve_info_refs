The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13650.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DigDash Enterprise application is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This occurs because the application allows a user-controlled URL in a request, causing the server to send an arbitrary HTTP request to a location of the attacker's choosing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application can be tricked into making requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can use the SSRF to extract service credentials used by the DigDash application.
- Internal network scanning: The vulnerability can be used to scan the internal network of the application by analyzing error messages indicating if a targeted server and port is open or closed.
- Unauthorized access: The extracted service credentials could be used to authenticate to internal services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The SSRF vulnerability is located on the login page and is accessible without an account, so no authentication is required.
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a modified domain name, redirecting the request to a team-controlled server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable DigDash application server.
- The attacker needs to control a server to receive and analyze the requests sent by the vulnerable application.
