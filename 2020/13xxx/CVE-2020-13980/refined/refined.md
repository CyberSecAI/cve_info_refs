  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization when handling uploaded images, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored XSS vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the image upload fields. When an administrator or user views the image within the application, the injected script will be executed, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading a malicious image file with injected script into image upload field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to upload images through the Opencart application interface and needs to craft a malicious image file containing malicious script. This requires some knowledge of web application security and image file format."
