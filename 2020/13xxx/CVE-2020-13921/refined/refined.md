Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13921

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input within wildcard query cases. Specifically, when H2, MySQL, or TiDB are used as the storage backend for Apache SkyWalking, a SQL injection vulnerability is present

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of user-provided inputs in wildcard queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database used by Apache SkyWalking. This may lead to unauthorized data access, data modification or even denial of service. The precise impact would depend on the database used and the attacker's goals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through wildcard queries made against the SkyWalking application that uses H2/MySQL/TiDB as a storage option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to make queries against the SkyWalking application.
- The SkyWalking instance must be configured to use H2, MySQL, or TiDB as the storage.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by pull request #4970 on the Apache SkyWalking GitHub repository, which included a fix for the SQL injection issue in the fuzzy query logic.
- The vulnerability affects Apache SkyWalking versions 6.5.0, 6.6.0, 7.0.0, 8.0.0 and 8.0.1.
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability has been resolved.
