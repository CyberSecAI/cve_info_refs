The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13509.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WinRing0x64 driver in NZXT CAM 4.8.0 improperly handles I/O request packets (IRPs), allowing a low-privilege user to directly access the processor's I/O ports using the `IN` instruction. The driver does not restrict access to these instructions, which allows reading from arbitrary I/O ports

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Privilege Management: The driver does not properly restrict access to the `IN` instruction, allowing a low-privilege user to perform privileged operations.
- Information Disclosure: The ability to read from arbitrary processor I/O ports can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- Direct access to I/O Ports: The driver directly exposes the IN instruction to userland.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read sensitive information from the processor's I/O ports.

**Attack vectors:**
A local attacker can send a specially crafted IRP (specifically IRP 0x9c4060cc) to the `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` device driver to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send IRPs to the device driver.
- The attacker does not require elevated privileges.
