This document provides details for CVE-2020-13555 and other related CVEs.

**CVE-2020-13555 - COM Server Application Privilege Escalation**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from weak file system permissions on several COM server DLLs and executables installed by Advantech WebAccess/SCADA. These files are referenced by COM Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) in the registry. Because the permissions allow any user to write to these files, a low-privileged user can replace these binaries with malicious versions. When a higher privileged user or the system invokes the COM server, the malicious code will execute with elevated privileges.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Incorrect default permissions on COM server DLLs and EXEs (`ACProjDecrypt.dll`, `opcenum.exe`, `webdobj.dll`, `AspVCObj.dll`, `WebSvcObj.dll`, `bwenumtag.dll`, `AspVBObj.dll`, `BAExt.dll`, `EMSLib.dll`, `WebCliSocketX.dll`, `wastchk.exe`, `webvobj.dll` ).
    *   Insecure COM server configuration, specifically the LocalServer32 and InprocServer32 registry entries pointing to the vulnerable files.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Privilege escalation to SYSTEM level. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or service that invokes the vulnerable COM server.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local file replacement
    *   COM object invocation

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the system.
    *   Ability to write to files in the installation directory (`C:\WebAccess\Node\`).
    *   Ability to trigger a COM object invocation, either by a user or by a system service.
