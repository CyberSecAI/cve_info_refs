Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-13971:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content is relevant to CVE-2020-13971. The document is a security update announcement for Shopware versions 6.1.0 up to and including 6.2.2, released in July 2020. It mentions specific vulnerabilities addressed in this update, which is consistent with the nature of a CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   **Authenticated Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  Specifically mentioned are `NEXT-9176` and `NEXT-9240` as authenticated stored XSS vulnerabilities. This means that an attacker, once authenticated, could inject malicious scripts that would be stored by the application and executed when other users view the affected content.
    *   **Authenticated Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Identified by `NEXT-9175`. This type of vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to make the server perform requests to other internal or external resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or other attacks.
    *   **Information Leakage:**  `NEXT-9174` points to an information leakage vulnerability present when the development environment is active, likely exposing sensitive configuration or debug information.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** `NEXT-9569` indicates a session hijacking vulnerability of customer accounts in the storefront. An attacker could potentially steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to customer accounts.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    *   Information Leakage
    *   Session Hijacking

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    *   **SSRF:**  Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential manipulation of external systems through the server.
    *   **Information Leakage:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks.
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  Unauthorized access and control over customer accounts, enabling fraud, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XSS:** Injection of malicious scripts via authenticated user input mechanisms within the application.
    *   **SSRF:** Manipulation of server-side request parameters to force the server to make unintended requests.
    *    **Information Leakage:**  Accessing the application when the development environment is active, likely through specific URLs or functionalities only available in debug mode.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Interception or theft of session cookies from vulnerable customer accounts.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **XSS & SSRF**: Requires a valid authenticated user account within the Shopware instance.
    *   **Information Leakage:** Access to the Shopware instance when it has the development environment enabled.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Ability to intercept or steal customer session cookies.
