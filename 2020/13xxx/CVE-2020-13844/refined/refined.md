        "root_cause": "Armv8-A core implementations utilizing speculative execution past unconditional changes in control flow.",
        "weaknesses": "Speculative execution past RET, BR (indirect jump), and BLR (indirect function call) instructions.",
         "impact": "Unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker via side-channel analysis.",
        "attack_vectors": "Local user access.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs local user access and capability to perform side-channel analysis.",
        "details": "The vulnerability arises from processors speculatively executing instructions after a control flow change (RET, BR, BLR). This speculative path, if containing a 'Spectre Revelation Gadget,' can lead to cache changes revealing secrets through timing analysis. Mitigations involve placing speculation barriers after RET/BR, and transforming BLR instructions to a BL + BR + speculation barrier sequence to avoid placing speculation barriers on the architectural path."

       "root_cause": "Miscompilation of 128bit Compare-and-Swap (CAS) operations on aarch64 architecture with gcc 10.2",
       "weaknesses": "Incorrect generation of assembly code during 128bit CAS, specifically in the fallback path when CASPAL instruction is not used.",
       "impact": "Incorrect values are written to memory in a 128bit atomic operation, potentially causing data corruption or logic errors.",
        "attack_vectors": "Code compilation using vulnerable gcc version",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to compile code using a vulnerable compiler version",
        "details": "The vulnerability stems from how gcc 10.2 generates code for 128bit CAS operations on aarch64. The fallback code path after failing to perform a CASPAL instruction incorrectly uses registers x0 and x1 (original values) instead of x2 and x3 (new values) to overwrite the memory location."

This occurs with gcc 10.1.1 but is resolved with gcc 10.2.1 and later. The root cause appears to stem from a specific code pattern that triggered a compiler error."

The root cause is linked to the generation of random identifiers within LTO sections and column information in debug info which changed default behavior in a specific commit. A patch has been provided to address this."
