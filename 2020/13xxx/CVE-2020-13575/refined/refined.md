Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the WS-Addressing plugin of Genivia gSOAP. Specifically, the code does not validate if the `Address` element is present within the `FaultTo` element of a SOAP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** If a SOAP request includes a `FaultTo` element but omits the nested `Address` element, the code will proceed without checking for its existence. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when the code attempts to access `oldheader->SOAP_WSA(FaultTo)->Address` in the `strcmp` function, causing the program to crash.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation to ensure that the `Address` element is present before attempting to use it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send a specially crafted SOAP request to the vulnerable service, triggering the NULL pointer dereference and causing the service to crash. This effectively leads to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based Attack:** The attacker can send a malicious SOAP request over the network to the vulnerable gSOAP service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required.

**Summary of provided details:**
- The Talos report provides the most detailed information, including code snippets, crash information, and a timeline of the vulnerability disclosure.
- The Debian LTS advisory confirms that the vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.8.75-1+deb10u1 for Debian 10.
