### Root cause of vulnerability
Improper access control when cloning projects via URL.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to clone a project's repository.

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker can gain unauthorized read access to a project's repository.

### Attack vectors
The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely via a URL.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker does not need to have any privileges or prior interaction with the application to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
