# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1193

## Micrium uC-HTTP HTTP Server unchecked return value denial-of-service vulnerability

##### January 26, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13582

### Summary

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the HTTP Server functionality of Micrium uC-HTTP 3.01.00. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to denial of service. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Micrium uC-HTTP 3.01.00

### Product URLs

<https://www.micrium.com/rtos/tcpip/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.6 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-690 - Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference

### Details

The uC-HTTP server implementation is designed to be used on embedded systems that are running the µC/OS II or µC/OS III RTOS kernels. This HTTP server supports many features including persistent connections, form processing, chunked transfer encoding, HTTP header fields processing, HTTP query string processing and dynamic content.

The HTTP server implementation includes support for parsing multipart forms. When looking for the `=` token within the boundary parameter, the code does not check the return value of `Str_Char_N` which returns a NULL pointer when the character is not found in the provided string. The pointer returned from `Str_Char_N` is incremented and then passed to the function `HTTP_StrGraphSrcFirst` which attempts to dereference this pointer whose value is `0x01` and results in invalid memory access. Below is the vulnerable piece of code found in the function `HTTPsReq_HdrParse` :

```
/* Boundary located after '='.                          */
p_val = Str_Char_N(p_val, len, ASCII_CHAR_EQUALS_SIGN);
p_val++;              /* Remove space before boundary val.                    */
p_val = HTTP_StrGraphSrchFirst(p_val,
                             len);

```
### Crash Information
