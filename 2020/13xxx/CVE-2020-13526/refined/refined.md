The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13526.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `sort` parameter in the `clientSetupAjax` page, which is then directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input being used in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into the `sort` parameter, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/oauth2/clientSetupAjax` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, which means having a valid user account in the application.
