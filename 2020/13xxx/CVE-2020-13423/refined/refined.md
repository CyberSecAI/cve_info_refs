The provided content is a product page for a Magento 2 Form Builder extension from landofcoder.com. While it does mention that "XSS bugs have been fixed for security", it doesn't provide specific details about the vulnerabilities, root cause, impact, or attack vectors. It does list the fields where XSS was fixed: User-Agent, Current\_url, and email fields.

Based on the information given, here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
- Input fields not properly sanitized to prevent cross site scripting

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to stealing user cookies, session hijacking, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors**:
- Malicious JavaScript code injected into vulnerable input fields.
- The specific fields mentioned are: User-Agent, Current\_url, and email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- The attacker would need to find a way to insert malicious data into the fields listed. This could potentially be done through an exposed form, or through an administrative interface if not protected correctly.
