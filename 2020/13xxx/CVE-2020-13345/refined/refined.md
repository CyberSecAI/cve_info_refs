Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The `SafeParamsHelper` in GitLab's codebase insufficiently filters parameters before passing them to `url_for`. It only excludes `:host`, `:port`, and `:protocol`, while Rails' `url_for` method has a larger set of reserved options which can be exploited to manipulate the generated URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Parameter Filtering:** The `safe_params` method does not remove all potentially dangerous parameters, such as `domain`, `script_name`, and others, leading to unexpected behavior when these parameters are passed to `url_for`.
*   **Open Redirect:** By manipulating the `domain` parameter, an attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary external site via the `RoutableActions`.
*   **Reflected XSS via `script_name`:** The `script_name` parameter, when set to `javascript:alert(1)//`, can be used to inject JavaScript into certain links (e.g., RSS feeds). Although often blocked by Content Security Policy (CSP), it's still a vulnerability that should be addressed.
*   **Reflected XSS with CSP bypass using the blob viewer:** By manipulating `script_name` to include a redirect to a specially crafted snippet, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script through the blob viewer by exploiting the `viewer_url`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Open Redirect:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other forms of attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates URL query parameters (`domain`, `script_name`, etc.) to trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs and entice users to click on them.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple locations in the GitLab codebase where `safe_params` is used with `url_for`.
*   The report identifies specific routes and HTML elements that are vulnerable.
*   The report also details a method to bypass CSP using the blob viewer by injecting malicious HTML.
*   The report also mentions that there might be other vulnerable locations using `safe_params`.

**Summary of CVE-2020-13345:**

This CVE involves an insufficient parameter filtering vulnerability in GitLab's `SafeParamsHelper` which allows attackers to conduct open redirects and reflected XSS attacks by manipulating URL parameters.
