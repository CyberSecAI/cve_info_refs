![Hugo Logo](/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg)
## The world’s fastest framework for building websites

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

[Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/)

![icon depicting Blistering Speed](/images/icon-fast.svg)

### Blistering Speed

What's modern about waiting for your site to build?

Hugo is the fastest tool of its kind. At <1 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a second.

![icon depicting Robust Content Management](/images/icon-content-management.svg)

### Robust Content Management

Flexibility rules. Hugo is a content strategist's dream.

Hugo supports unlimited content types, taxonomies, menus, dynamic API-driven content, and more, all without plugins.

![icon depicting Shortcodes](/images/icon-shortcodes.svg)

### Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes are Markdown's hidden superpower.

We love the beautiful simplicity of Markdown’s syntax, but there are times when we want more flexibility. Hugo shortcodes allow for both beauty and flexibility.

![icon depicting Built-in Templates](/images/icon-built-in-templates.svg)

### Built-in Templates

Hugo has common patterns to get your work done quickly.

Hugo ships with pre-made templates to make quick work of SEO, commenting, analytics and other functions. One line of code, and you're done.

![icon depicting Multilingual and i18n](/images/icon-multilingual2.svg)

### Multilingual and i18n

Polyglot baked in.

Hugo provides full i18n support for multi-language sites with the same straightforward development experience Hugo users love in single-language sites.

![icon depicting Custom Outputs](/images/icon-custom-outputs.svg)

### Custom Outputs

HTML not enough?

Hugo allows you to output your content in multiple formats, including JSON or AMP, and makes it easy to create your own.

### Hugo Sponsors

### 300+ Themes

Hugo provides a robust theming system that is easy to implement but capable of producing even the most complicated websites.

[Check out the Hugo themes.](https://themes.gohugo.io/)

![image depicting an example of Capable Templating](/images/home-page-templating-example.png)

### Capable Templating

Hugo's Go-based templating provides just the right amount of logic to build anything from the simple to complex.

[Get Started.](https://gohugo.io/templates/)

Hugo works on macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and others.

Host on any server or your favorite CDN.

RoyalTS SSH Tunnel - Authentication Bypass
===============================================================================

Identifiers
-------------------------------------------------
* CVE-2020-13872

CVSSv3 score
-------------------------------------------------
8.8 - [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L](
<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L&version=3.1>
)

Vendor
-------------------------------------------------
RoyalApps - <https://www.royalapps.com/>

Product
-------------------------------------------------

```
Royal TS provides powerful, easy and secure access to your remote
systems.
It's the perfect tool for server admins, system engineers, developers
and IT focused information workers
who constantly need to access remote systems with different protocols
(like RDP, VNC, SSH, HTTP/S, and many more.).
```

Affected versions
-------------------------------------------------
 - All versions prior to RoyalTS v5 for Windows.

Credit
-------------------------------------------------
Michele Toccagni - toccagni.info

Vulnerability summary
-------------------------------------------------

```
This vulnerability allows a remote attackers to bypass the
authentication of the tunnel
```

and gain access to an internal network. The problem is that, once a
SSH tunnel is created on the bridge host with a Secure Gateway, this
tunnel will listen on the address 0.0.0.0 on the port opened ad hoc by
RoyalTS (higher than 50000), leaving the possibility for anyone to
exploit the tunnel without having to authenticate to it.

```
The attacker could easily bruteforce the ssh/rdp login in the internal
network, or,
even worse, if the hosts aren't patched, could use some known exploits
and perform lateral movements.
```

The vulnerability is fixed in the current major release (Royal TS V5).

Proof of concept
-------------------------------------------------

```
I wrote a detailed blog post to explain the bug:
<https://hacktips.it/royalts-ssh-tunnel-authentication-bypass/>
```

Solution
-------------------------------------------------
Upgrade to RoyalTS V5 for Windows

Timeline
-------------------------------------------------
Date        | Status
------------|---------------------
04-JUN-2020 | Reported to vendor

```
04-JUN-2020 | Vendor replied that it's a known bug and it's fixed on the
last major version
```

06-JUN-2020 | CVE assigned

  The CMS from @getgrav continues to impress. "What do I need to do to implement open graph metadata? Oh… nothing."

  Ohh how I love deployments in Grav (@getgrav)! Everything is a .md or .yaml file, no hassle with DBs or other content silos.

  You know, @getgrav may finally be a CMS that does not weight me down for projects I love. And yes, the pun was definitely intended.

  Loving @getgrav over wordpress. If you are developer, you're probably going to fall for it. If your not, you'll probably like it as well.

# RoyalTS SSH Tunnel - Authentication Bypass [CVE-2020-13872]

Tempo di lettura: *7 minuti*

Data pubblicazione: *June 8, 2020*
## Description

During a recent assessment I had to use the software in question (RoyalTS v4.3.61328 for Windows) to reach some servers via port forwarding. The software uses a “Secure Gateway” to create an authenticated tunnel (created by Royal Server), installed on a bridge server. Once installed, all you have to do is create an SSH connection to the target server and enter the IP address of the bridge server as Secure Gateway.

Royal Server Settings installed on the bridge host

The problem is that, once a SSH tunnel is created on the bridge host with a Secure Gateway, this tunnel will listen on the address 0.0.0.0 on the port opened ad hoc by RoyalTS (higher than 50000), leaving the possibility for anyone to exploit the tunnel without having to authenticate to it.

For example, if I want to connect to the Host C, through the Secure Gateway (Host B), RoyalTS would create a tunnel with the Royal Server on the Host B and open the SSH connection with Host C, as in the image below

![SSH connection opened through the tunnel](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-21.png)

But, if we look at the active connections on my host (Host A), we can see that RoyalTS.exe is open on 0.0.0.0 and anyone in my network could exploit the tunnel without authenticating to the Secure Server

![The service is listening on 0.0.0.0](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-9.png)

The service is listening on 0.0.0.0

If we look at the settings, we can see that the section âRemote Ports accept Connections from other Hosts" is disabled

## Impact

An attacker, within the same network as host A, with a simple port scan, can immediately notice that non-standard ports are open. Before tunnel weâve got the following situation, where 192.168.25.1 is the IP address of the target host A.

![All ports are closed](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-12.png)

All ports are closed

After the creation of the tunnel, we can see the open port.

![The port 59349 is now open](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-13.png)

The port 59349 is now open

Imagine a situation where a developer has a lot of open tunnels, like this

![Three opened tunnel, on ports 59349,59381 and 59384](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-14.png)

Three opened tunnel, on ports 59349,59381 and 59384

An attacker could easily find the open ports, where each of which refers to one host:

* 59349 for the first;
* 59381 for the second;
* 59384 for the third;

![Three ssh connections for the three hosts](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-15.png)

Three ssh connections for the three hosts

The attacker could easily bruteforce the ssh login, or, even worse, if the servers arenât patched and, for example, the service RDP is open, he could use some known exploits, like [BlueKeep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueKeep).

Another example could be:

I’m in a library with RoyalTS v4 opened with a tunnel (authenticated) and a connection throught telnet (or ssh) with no credentials into host C.

Another person (the attacker), connected into the same network, could see the open port of my pc (with a port scan) and **use that tunnel (with no authentication, because it’s established yet) to connect throught telnet (or ssh) and gain access to the host A.**

If the host A has authentication, the attacker obviously need to bruteforce it or to exploit it, but the vulnerability is that the tunnel, that is listening on 0.0.0.0, is open to everyone withouth the authentication.

Also, if I connect to the host C on port 59349 exploiting the vulnerability

![SSH connection established](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-18.png)

SSH connection established

In the bridge connections I will not appear

![Only one tunnel opened, instead of two](https://hacktips.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/immagine-19.png)

Only one tunnel opened, instead of two

## Conclusion

If you are using a version prior to v5, **I suggest to update immediately to the [major release](https://www.royalapps.com/ts/win/download)**. The vulnerability is confirmed for the Windows application, however is possibile that the Royal TSX < 4 (for Mac) is affected too.

**CVSS 3.1 Vector**: [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L&version=3.1)

**Risk Score: 8.8**
