Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-13872:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure implementation of SSH tunneling in Royal TS software. When a secure gateway (Royal Server) creates an SSH tunnel, the tunnel listens on `0.0.0.0` on a high-numbered port (above 50000) on the bridge host. This makes the tunnel accessible to anyone on the same network without requiring authentication to the Royal Server or the established tunnel itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authentication required to utilize the established SSH tunnel, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Insecure Tunnel Exposure:** The SSH tunnel listens on `0.0.0.0`, which means it is available on all network interfaces of the bridge host. This makes it accessible to any machine on the same network.
*   **Disabled Setting Ineffectiveness:** The option within RoyalTS to "Remote Ports accept Connections from other Hosts" is disabled, yet the tunnel still accepts connections from other hosts, indicating a configuration or implementation flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Network Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to the internal network via the established SSH tunnel.
*   **Lateral Movement:** After gaining unauthorized network access, attackers can attempt to brute-force SSH or RDP logins to hosts on the internal network, and potentially use known exploits for lateral movement.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** Once inside the network, the attacker could exfiltrate sensitive data or manipulate systems within the network.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** If the attacker gains access to systems that have known vulnerabilities, they could attempt remote code execution.
*   **Compromise of Internal Systems:** Attackers could achieve unauthorized access to internal resources, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The primary attack vector is that the attacker needs to be on the same network as the host running RoyalTS and the established tunnel on the bridge server.
*   **Port Scanning:** Attackers would identify the open, high-numbered ports on the bridge host using a port scanner.
*   **Direct Connection:** Once an open port is identified, the attacker directly connects to that port to exploit the existing SSH tunnel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker must be on the same network as the machine running the vulnerable version of RoyalTS with an established SSH tunnel.
*   **Basic Port Scanning Knowledge:**  Attackers would need to have knowledge of port scanning to identify the open ports created by Royal TS.
*   **Knowledge of Exploiting Services:** After gaining access to internal networks, attackers could attempt to use exploits against internal services or brute-force logins.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is confirmed to exist in RoyalTS v4 and prior versions for Windows.
*   It is suspected that RoyalTSX for macOS may also be affected if versions are prior to v4.
*   The vendor has addressed the issue in RoyalTS v5.
