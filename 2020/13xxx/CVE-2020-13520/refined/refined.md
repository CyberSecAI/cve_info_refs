{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the fact that path indices arenâ€™t checked to ensure they fall inside the appropriate vector.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-119 - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
      "Out-of-bounds memory write"
    ],
    "impact": "A malformed USDC file with very large `pathIndexes` values can cause multiple out of bounds memory writes which can lead to further memory corruption and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted malformed file can trigger an out of bounds memory modification.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malformed file that is then accessed by the victim. This could be via various means such as a website, email attachment, or file share."
