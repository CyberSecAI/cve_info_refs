# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1120

## Pixar OpenUSD Binary File Format Decompressed Path Rebuilding Memory corruption

##### November 12, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13520

### Summary

An out of bounds memory corruption vulnerability exists in the way Pixar OpenUSD 20.05 reconstructs paths from binary USD files. A specially crafted malformed file can trigger an out of bounds memory modification which can result in remote code execution. To trigger this vulnerability, victim needs to access an attacker-provided malformed file.

### Tested Versions

Pixar OpenUSD 20.05

Apple macOS Catalina 10.15.3

### Product URLs

<https://openusd.org>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-119 - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

### Details

OpenUSD stands for open Universal Scene Descriptor and is a software suite by Pixar that facilitates, among other things, interchange of arbitrary 3-D scenes that may be composed of many elemental assets.

Most notably, USD and its backing file format `usd` are used on Apple iOS and macOS as part of ModelIO framework in support of SceneKit and ARKit for sharing and displaying 3D scenes in, for example, augmented reality applications. On macOS, these files are automatically rendered to generate thumbnails, while on iOS they can be shared via iMessage and opened with user interaction.

USD binary file format consists of a header pointing to a table of contents that in turn points to individual sections that comprise the whole file. The `PATHS` section of the file consists of three distinct arrays of integers which are used to reconstruct the SDF paths during file parsing. These arrays represent indices and are: `pathIndexes`, `elementTokenIndexes` and `jumps`. After decoding these three arrays, the actual paths need to be reconstructed and this is done by invoking the following code:

```
void
CrateFile::_BuildDecompressedPathsImpl(
vector<uint32_t> const &pathIndexes,
vector<int32_t> const &elementTokenIndexes,
vector<int32_t> const &jumps,
size_t curIndex,
SdfPath parentPath,
WorkArenaDispatcher &dispatcher)
{
bool hasChild = false, hasSibling = false;
do {
    auto thisIndex = curIndex++;
    if (parentPath.IsEmpty()) {
        parentPath = SdfPath::AbsoluteRootPath();
        _paths[pathIndexes[thisIndex]] = parentPath;            [1]
    } else {
        int32_t tokenIndex = elementTokenIndexes[thisIndex];
        bool isPrimPropertyPath = tokenIndex < 0;
        tokenIndex = std::abs(tokenIndex);
        auto const &elemToken = _tokens[tokenIndex];
        _paths[pathIndexes[thisIndex]] =                        [2]
            isPrimPropertyPath ?
            parentPath.AppendProperty(elemToken) :
            parentPath.AppendElementToken(elemToken);
    }

    // If we have either a child or a sibling but not both, then just
    // continue to the neighbor.  If we have both then spawn a task for the
    // sibling and do the child ourself.  We think that our path trees tend
    // to be broader more often than deep.

    hasChild = (jumps[thisIndex] > 0) || (jumps[thisIndex] == -1);
    hasSibling = (jumps[thisIndex] >= 0);

```

Inputs to the above method are three arrays of indices. To illustrate the algorithm, we can observe the following contents from a regular USD file:

```
Path Indexes: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Element Token Indexes: [7, 5, 12, 11]
Jumps Indexes: [-1, -1, 0, -2]

```

Path indices are incremental, element token indices refer to string tokens in TOKENS section and jumps encode whether child or sibling elements for a path exist. For the concrete example, the above arrays might encode following paths:

```
</> : SdfSpecTypePseudoRoot
</World> : SdfSpecTypePrim
</World/camera> : SdfSpecTypePrim
</World/scope> : SdfSpecTypePrim

```

When parsing the USDC file, these are reconstructed by calling `_BuildDecompressedPathsImpl` method. The vulnerability arises from the fact that path indices aren’t checked to ensure they fall inside the appropriate vector. The indices in `pathIndexes` are 32 bit integers allowing for a large range of out of bounds access values in the above code at [1] and [2]. In both instances an object of `SdfPath` type will be written to the supplied address. A malformed USDC file with very large `pathIndexes` values can cause multiple out of bounds memory writes which can lead to further memory corruption and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Crash Information

The attached proof of concept trigger crashes with the following ASAN message:
