Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-13848:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `FindServiceControlURLPath` and `FindServiceEventURLPath` functions within the `genlib/service_table/service_table.c` file of the `libupnp` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code does not properly handle cases where the `controlURLPath` or `eventURLPath` parameters passed to the mentioned functions are NULL. This results in dereferencing a null pointer, causing a crash.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks validation to check if the provided URL paths are valid before parsing them using `parse_uri`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a crash of the application using `libupnp` by sending specially crafted SSDP messages which contain malformed SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE requests. This results in the application becoming unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **SSDP Messages:** Attackers send crafted SSDP messages (specifically SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE) with malformed or missing URL paths.
- **Malicious SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE Requests**: The vulnerability is triggered when processing malformed SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service using `libupnp`.
- **Ability to Send SSDP Messages:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted SSDP messages to the vulnerable service.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be launched without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `libupnp` versions 1.12.1 and earlier.
- The issue can be triggered by sending a malformed SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE message using netcat (`nc`).
- The vulnerability is triggered within the functions `FindServiceControlURLPath` and `FindServiceEventURLPath` in `genlib/service_table/service_table.c`.
- Patches were released to address this vulnerability in various distributions, including openSUSE and Debian.
- The fix involves adding a check for null values for the URL paths before processing them within the functions.
