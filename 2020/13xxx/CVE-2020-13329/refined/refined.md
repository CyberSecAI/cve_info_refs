Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of HTML content within the Swagger UI component used for rendering OpenAPI files in GitLab's blob viewer. The Swagger UI allows HTML tags and attributes within descriptions, which are not properly sanitized by GitLab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, due to the improper handling of user-supplied HTML.
*   **Inadequate HTML Sanitization:**  GitLab doesn't effectively filter out malicious HTML attributes like `class`, `style`, and `data-*`.
    *   `class` and `style` attributes allow attackers to manipulate the visual presentation, such as creating transparent overlays.
    *   `data-*` attributes used in conjunction with `jquery-ujs` allow attackers to trigger arbitrary requests to the server (GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD) with arbitrary parameters.
*   **CSP Bypass:** The Content Security Policy (CSP) is easily bypassed using `jQuery.globalEval`, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** Attackers can perform any action on behalf of a logged-in user.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker can create a transparent overlay to intercept user clicks and redirect them to a phishing page.
*   **UI Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the visual presentation of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attack vector involves creating a malicious JSON file (OpenAPI/Swagger specification) containing malicious HTML and JavaScript, and uploading it to a GitLab repository.
*   **File View:** The XSS is triggered when a user views the malicious file in GitLab's blob viewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **GitLab User:**  An attacker needs an account on a GitLab instance to create or modify a repository.
*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a file in a project.

**More Details:**
The provided information gives more detail than the CVE description placeholder. It includes the specific vulnerable attributes (`class`, `style`, `data-*`), the use of `jquery-ujs` and `jQuery.globalEval`, as well as steps to reproduce the vulnerability. The report also demonstrates the impact using a transparent layer that intercepts clicks, and a javascript alert.
