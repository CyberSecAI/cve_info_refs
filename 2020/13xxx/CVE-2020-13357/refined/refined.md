{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly validate user permissions when accessing feature flag user lists. Specifically, it relies on a predictable, sequential ID (`user_list_id`) that can be easily manipulated by an attacker to access unauthorized user list information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain the names and potentially the user IDs associated with feature flag user lists from any project (including private ones), exposing sensitive information about project configurations and user involvement in feature flags.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `user_list_id` parameter in a PUT request to `/group_new_1/project_1/-/feature_flags/1`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to GitLab, and they need to have a project where they can edit a feature flag. They can then intercept and modify the PUT request when editing a feature flag."
