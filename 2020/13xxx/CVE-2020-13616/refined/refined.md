The provided content relates to CVE-2020-13616.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper TLS certificate verification when acting as an egress proxy in the pichi-router/pichi project. Specifically, the code did not verify the remote host name against the certificate presented by the server, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure TLS certificate verification. The code was not correctly verifying the hostname in the server's certificate against the requested hostname during TLS connections. This was happening when no CA file was specified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept and potentially modify the traffic between pichi and the target server, since the client will accept any certificate that presents any name, as long as it is trusted by the system. This could lead to information disclosure, data tampering, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- A man-in-the-middle attacker positioned between the pichi-router and the server it connects to.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between the pichi-router instance and the target server.
- The attacker needs a valid TLS certificate that is trusted by the system running the pichi-router, but that doesn't necessarily match the hostname being requested.

**Additional Details:**
The fix implemented in the commit `4698664233bc324f26658d2b041bfe6ea022c573` addresses the vulnerability by:
- Verifying nothing if the 'insecure' option is set to true.
- Verifying only with the CA file if it's specified.
- Otherwise, verifying according to RFC 2818, which includes hostname verification.
