## Description

![@humblelad](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30574278?u=17e9124d76daf5db7efd32ed77922e4d0196e1da&v=4&size=48)[humblelad](https://github.com/humblelad)opened [on Apr 19, 2020](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues/5265#issue-602760697)

**Describe the bug**

It is possible to redirect a user to an attacker owned domain and trick the user. I am investigating on the potential chaining of this bug to perform other attacks.

**Expected behavior**

Redirection to external urls must not be allowed.

**To Reproduce**

This occurs at the main login page when the user enters an invalid username/password.

The url gets changed to

`http://localhost:1501/authentication/login?old=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A1501%2Fhome`

An attacker can change the url(to any attacker owned domain which may mimic submitty interface) to something like

`localhost:1501/authentication/login?old=http%3A%2F%2Flgoogle.com`

and trick redirection to google.com users after they enter their creds.

**Additional context**

This can be prevented either by-

1. Adding regex checks on url and whitelisting the url.
2. Completely removing GET request based url redirection.

I am trying to fix this but thought to create this issue for others to contribute the fix if interested.
