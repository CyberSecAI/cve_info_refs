- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An attacker can trick an administrator into visiting a malicious site, which can lead to the creation of a carefully named directory on the file system. This directory can then be leveraged in a brute-force attack to achieve remote code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote code execution (RCE)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary PHP code execution, allowing a full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  Social engineering to trick an administrator into visiting a malicious site.
    - Creation of a specific directory structure on the file system.
    - Brute-forcing a remote code execution vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to create a malicious website and lure an administrator to visit it.
    - Ability to perform brute-force attacks.
    - Access to the file system (indirectly through the created directory).

**Additional Information:**
- Windows servers are mentioned as being more likely to be affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been rated as "Critical"
