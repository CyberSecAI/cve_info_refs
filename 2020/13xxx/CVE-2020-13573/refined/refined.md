```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs due to a missing check on the Address Item Length in a 'Send Unit Data' message. The application doesn't validate if the provided length is within acceptable bounds before using it as an offset. This allows an attacker to provide an out-of-range offset, causing a read from an unmapped memory location.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (CWE-823)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. The vulnerable code dereferences an invalid memory address, causing the application to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted network request. An attacker sends a Register Session request followed by a Send Unit Data message with an Address Item Length smaller than the actual data that follows, triggering the out-of-bounds read.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic service. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."
