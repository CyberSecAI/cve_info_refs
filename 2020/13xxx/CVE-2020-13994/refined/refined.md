Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-13994:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper access control of uploaded resources. Specifically, the application allows a privileged user (admin) to upload a file, which can then be accessed directly through the webserver, leading to code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not properly validate the type or content of files uploaded for UI customization (login box header image). This allows the upload of PHP files.
- **Lack of Access Control:** Uploaded files are placed in a publicly accessible directory (`/cache`), without proper access control.
- **Direct File Access:** The application allows direct access to the uploaded files via URL, enabling the execution of malicious PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file, which is then directly accessible and executable by the webserver, leading to complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker needs to have admin access to the application to upload files via the settings page.
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file using the UI customization feature.
- **Direct Web Access:** The attacker accesses the uploaded file directly via a web browser by its known location to trigger execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged user:**  Requires administrative level access to the application's settings panel to upload files.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to upload and execute the malicious PHP file.
- **Knowledge of file location:** The attacker needs to know the location where the uploaded file is stored in the server to access it directly through the webserver

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The exploit described leverages an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2020-13992) to modify the application settings and upload the malicious PHP file.
- The exploit also includes techniques to either reassign the ticket to an admin user for execution or phish an admin user into visiting the malicious ticket
- The attacker can use a crafted XSS payload within a ticket to modify the settings page, upload a PHP file, and then execute it by accessing it directly through a web browser.
-  A more stealthy approach is also described to reset the settings back to normal after the backdoor is installed.
-  The attacker can exfiltrate data or reply to submitted tickets.
