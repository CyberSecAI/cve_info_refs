    *   **CSRF**: An attacker could trick a user into performing unintended actions on the log-clear controller, such as clearing logs they did not intend to. This can disrupt audit trails or mask malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious code through input fields or parameters related to the bulk resize action.
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker could craft a malicious request to the log-clear controller action, which is then executed by an authenticated user.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **XSS**: The attacker would need to have the ability to inject malicious code into the Bulk Resize action, which might require having some level of access to the application.
    *   **CSRF**: The attacker would need to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a form crafted by the attacker.
