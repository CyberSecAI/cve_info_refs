{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The OAuth token endpoint (`https://gitlab.com/oauth/token`) with the `grant_type=password` parameter lacks rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms present on the `/users/sign_in` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of rate limiting on the OAuth token endpoint.",
      "Lack of account lockout after multiple failed login attempts."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can perform brute-force and credential spraying attacks against GitLab user accounts by repeatedly sending requests to the `/oauth/token` endpoint, potentially gaining unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending POST requests to the `https://gitlab.com/oauth/token` endpoint with `grant_type=password` and varying username/password combinations.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have knowledge of existing usernames/email addresses to target specific accounts and attempt to brute-force passwords. No special access is needed to send requests to the OAuth endpoint."
