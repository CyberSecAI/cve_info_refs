## [PATCH v2 1/2] ait-vga: check address before reading configuration bytes

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <pjp@fedoraproject.org>

While reading PCI configuration bytes, a guest may send an
address towards the end of the configuration space. It may lead
to an OOB access issue. Add check to ensure 'address + size' is
within PCI configuration space.

Subject: CVE-2020-13791 QEMU: ati-vga: OOB access while reading PCI configuration
 may lead to DoS

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the ati-vga emulator of the QEMU.
It could occur while reading PCI configuration bytes via ati_mm_read routine,
if the address sent by a guest is towards an end of the PCI configuration
space. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process
resulting in DoS scenario.

Upstream patch

This issue was reported by Ren Ding and Hanqing Zhao of SSLab Georgia Tech and
Yi Ren(CC'd)

'CVE-2020-13791' requeted via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.

## [PATCH] pci: check address before reading configuration bytes

| **Subject**: | [PATCH] pci: check address before reading configuration bytes |
| **Date**: | Wed, 3 Jun 2020 18:10:41 +0530 |

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <pjp@fedoraproject.org>

While reading PCI configuration bytes, a guest may send an
address towards the end of the configuration space. It may lead
to an OOB access issue. Add check to ensure 'address + len' is
within PCI configuration space.

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.
