Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds (OOB) access issue exists in the `ati-vga` emulator within QEMU. This occurs when reading PCI configuration bytes via the `ati_mm_read` routine. A guest can send an address towards the end of the PCI configuration space, which is not properly validated, leading to the OOB read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to missing address validation before accessing PCI configuration space.
- **Lack of input validation:** The QEMU code did not check if the requested address + size for PCI configuration access was within the allowed bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user/process could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial-of-service condition for the virtual machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Guest-initiated:** The attack is initiated from within a virtual machine by sending a crafted address when reading PCI configuration bytes.
- **Access to the guest OS is required:** An attacker needs to have a user or process running within the guest operating system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a guest operating system.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific address in order to trigger the out of bounds read

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `hw/display/ati.c` of QEMU.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `address + size` is within the PCI configuration space bounds before performing the read.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ren Ding, Hanqing Zhao, and Yi Ren.
- The provided patch link shows the fix being applied in the `ati_mm_read` function.

The NetApp advisory lists this CVE with a CVSS score of 5.5 (MEDIUM), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, meaning it is a local attack, with low complexity and privilege, no user interaction, and resulting in a high impact on availability.

The Gentoo security advisory lists this CVE and indicates that it is exploitable locally and remotely.

The openwall post includes the same information as the patch commit, that a guest can trigger an OOB read in QEMU's ati-vga component, leading to a crash.
