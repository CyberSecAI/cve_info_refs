Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, relevant to CVE-2020-13471:

**CVE-2020-13471:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability lies in a hardware design flaw within the APM32F103 microcontrollers, specifically related to how the Flash Patch and Breakpoint Unit (FPB) and the boot process interact with power glitches. This allows for repurposing a hardware-based firmware live-patching mechanism.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   The Flash Patch and Breakpoint Unit (FPB) configuration is not cleared by a reset, only by a power cycle.
    *   A power glitch can trigger a reset while preserving SRAM contents (SRAM data remanence).
    *   The ability to boot from SRAM while flash memory is locked is a weakness, particularly when combined with the other vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can gain privileged shell access to the microcontroller.
    *   The attacker can read out the protected flash memory and perform arbitrary modifications to the system.
    *   Bypasses the flash memory protection mechanisms present in RDP level 1.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Power Glitching:** The attacker introduces a very short power cycle to trigger a reset, which releases the flash lockdown while preserving SRAM contents.
    *   **SRAM Booting:** The device is configured to boot from SRAM.
    *   **FPB Repurposing:** The FPB is used to redirect the control flow from the flash memory boot to shellcode stored in SRAM.
    *   The FPB is configured to patch the reset vector fetch from the hard-coded address 0x00000004, replacing it with the attacker's shell code entry point.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Physical access to the microcontroller is required.
    *   Ability to manipulate the power supply of the microcontroller.
    *   Ability to control the BOOT0/BOOT1 pins.
    *   Basic microcontroller programming knowledge for creating the exploit firmware.
    *   Access to debugging/programming interface to load the initial exploit code to SRAM.

**Additional Notes from Document:**

* The attack described for CVE-2020-13471 is a multi-stage, low-level attack using a power glitch and the Flash Patch and Breakpoint Unit (FPB) to redirect execution to a shellcode in SRAM and extract the entire flash memory content.
* This attack was successfully demonstrated on both the APM32F103 and the STM32F103 microcontrollers.
* The attack uses a very short power cycle to unlock the flash memory, then redirects execution using the FPB, and finally, a shell code reads the flash memory.
* The exploit code for this attack is available online, alongside other related exploits, which helps demonstrate the simplicity of this attack vector.
* The vulnerability exists because the FPB configuration is preserved after a reset, and this preservation, combined with the reset and boot sequence, makes it possible to manipulate the control flow.

This vulnerability is also described in other sources with CVE-2020-13466, where the same attack technique is shown on the STM32F103 device, and also involves glitching the device to execute code from RAM while bypassing the flash protection.

**Summary:**

The content is highly relevant to CVE-2020-13471. It provides significant details on the technical aspects of a power glitching attack using the FPB in APM32F103 microcontrollers (and similar STM32F103 devices, covered by CVE-2020-13466) to bypass security protections and extract the firmware. The content also details the specific steps required, the necessary attacker capabilities, and the impact of a successful exploit, as well as the underlying causes in the hardware implementation of these devices.
