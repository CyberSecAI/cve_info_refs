| RCA-2121 | Stylesheet | Incorrect value found in the Astro v5 Stylesheet. |

## Manual fixes

#### RCA-2121

In both the **Astro v5 Standard** and **Astro v5 Timebar** stylesheets there are two sections that use the greater than symbol (>). These sections are the *#fpIframe > iframe* and *#digitalframe > iframe* sections

This has been replaced with the value **&gt;** This is causing the on-demand maps and other secondary content to not be displayed correctly.

To resolve, remove the values **&gt;** in the stylesheet.
