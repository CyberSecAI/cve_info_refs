Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13350:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection on the endpoints used to pause or resume runners in the GitLab admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests sent to `/admin/runners/:runner_id/resume` and `/admin/runners/:runner_id/pause`, allowing an attacker to trigger these actions via a crafted request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can use CSRF to:
- **Pause runners:** This would interrupt CI/CD pipelines and potentially halt software development or deployments.
- **Resume runners:** While not as severe, this might cause unwanted resource consumption or reveal configurations intended to be temporarily paused

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to trick an authenticated GitLab administrator into visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the crafted requests. This is achieved by embedding a forged request to the vulnerable endpoints on the malicious page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to convince a logged-in GitLab administrator to visit a malicious website or interact with malicious content (e.g., via a link).
- The attacker does not need prior access to the GitLab instance as the attack relies on the administrator's existing authenticated session.
