An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for singularity fixes the following issues:
- New version 3.6.0. This version introduces a new signature format for
SIF images, and changes to the signing / verification code to address
the following security problems:
- CVE-2020-13845, boo#1174150 In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0,
issues allow the ECL to be bypassed by a malicious user.
- CVE-2020-13846, boo#1174148 In Singularity 3.5 the --all / -a option
to singularity verify returns success even when some objects in a SIF
container are not signed,
or cannot be verified.
- CVE-2020-13847, boo#1174152 In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0,
Singularity's sign and verify commands do not sign metadata found in
the global header or data object descriptors of a SIF file, allowing
an attacker to cause unexpected behavior. A signed container may
verify successfully, even when it has been modified in ways that could
be exploited to cause malicious behavior.
- New features / functionalities
- A new '--legacy-insecure' flag to verify allows verification of SIF
signatures in the old, insecure format.
- A new '-l / --logs' flag for instance list that shows the paths to
instance STDERR / STDOUT log files.
- The --json output of instance list now include paths to STDERR /
STDOUT log files.
- Singularity now supports the execution of minimal Docker/OCI
containers that do not contain /bin/sh, e.g. docker://hello-world.
- A new cache structure is used that is concurrency safe on a filesystem
that supports atomic rename. If you downgrade to Singularity 3.5 or
older after using 3.6 you will need to run singularity cache clean.
- A plugin system rework adds new hook points that will allow the
development of plugins that modify behavior of the runtime. An image
driver concept is introduced for plugins to support new ways of
handling image and
overlay mounts. Plugins built for <=3.5 are not compatible with 3.6.
- The --bind flag can now bind directories from a SIF or ext3 image into
a container.
- The --fusemount feature to mount filesystems to a container via FUSE
drivers is now a supported feature (previously an experimental hidden
flag).
- This permits users to mount e.g. sshfs and cvmfs filesystems to the
container at runtime.
- A new -c/--config flag allows an alternative singularity.conf to be
specified by the root user, or all users in an unprivileged
installation.
- A new --env flag allows container environment variables to be set via
the Singularity command line.
- A new --env-file flag allows container environment variables to be set
from a specified file.
- A new --days flag for cache clean allows removal of items older than a
specified number of days. Replaces the --name flag which is not
generally useful as the cache entries are stored by hash, not a
friendly name.
- Changed defaults / behaviours
- New signature format (see security fixes above).
- Fixed spacing of singularity instance list to be dynamically changing
based off of input lengths instead of fixed number of spaces to account
for long instance names.
- Environment variables prefixed with SINGULARITYENV\_ always take
precedence over variables without SINGULARITYENV\_ prefix.
- The %post build section inherits environment variables from the base
image.
- %files from ... will now follow symlinks for sources that are directly
specified, or directly resolved from a glob pattern. It will not follow
symlinks found through directory traversal. This mirrors Docker
multi-stage COPY behaviour.
- Restored the CWD mount behaviour of v2, implying that CWD path is not
recreated inside container and any symlinks in the CWD path are not
resolved anymore to determine the destination path inside container.
- The %test build section is executed the same manner as singularity test
image.
--fusemount with the container: default directive will foreground the
FUSE process. Use container-daemon: for previous behavior.
- Deprecate -a / --all option to sign/verify as new signature behavior
makes this the default.
- For more information about upstream changes, please check:
<https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>
- Removed --name flag for cache clean; replaced with --days.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for singularity fixes the following issues:
- New version 3.6.0. This version introduces a new signature format for
SIF images, and changes to the signing / verification code to address
the following security problems:
- CVE-2020-13845, boo#1174150 In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0,
issues allow the ECL to be bypassed by a malicious user.
- CVE-2020-13846, boo#1174148 In Singularity 3.5 the --all / -a option
to singularity verify returns success even when some objects in a SIF
container are not signed,
or cannot be verified.
- CVE-2020-13847, boo#1174152 In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0,
Singularity's sign and verify commands do not sign metadata found in
the global header or data object descriptors of a SIF file, allowing
an attacker to cause unexpected behavior. A signed container may
verify successfully, even when it has been modified in ways that could
be exploited to cause malicious behavior.
- New features / functionalities
- A new '--legacy-insecure' flag to verify allows verification of SIF
signatures in the old, insecure format.
- A new '-l / --logs' flag for instance list that shows the paths to
instance STDERR / STDOUT log files.
- The --json output of instance list now include paths to STDERR /
STDOUT log files.
- Singularity now supports the execution of minimal Docker/OCI
containers that do not contain /bin/sh, e.g. docker://hello-world.
- A new cache structure is used that is concurrency safe on a filesystem
that supports atomic rename. If you downgrade to Singularity 3.5 or
older after using 3.6 you will need to run singularity cache clean.
- A plugin system rework adds new hook points that will allow the
development of plugins that modify behavior of the runtime. An image
driver concept is introduced for plugins to support new ways of
handling image and
overlay mounts. Plugins built for <=3.5 are not compatible with 3.6.
- The --bind flag can now bind directories from a SIF or ext3 image into
a container.
- The --fusemount feature to mount filesystems to a container via FUSE
drivers is now a supported feature (previously an experimental hidden
flag).
- This permits users to mount e.g. sshfs and cvmfs filesystems to the
container at runtime.
- A new -c/--config flag allows an alternative singularity.conf to be
specified by the root user, or all users in an unprivileged
installation.
- A new --env flag allows container environment variables to be set via
the Singularity command line.
- A new --env-file flag allows container environment variables to be set
from a specified file.
- A new --days flag for cache clean allows removal of items older than a
specified number of days. Replaces the --name flag which is not
generally useful as the cache entries are stored by hash, not a
friendly name.
- Changed defaults / behaviours
- New signature format (see security fixes above).
- Fixed spacing of singularity instance list to be dynamically changing
based off of input lengths instead of fixed number of spaces to account
for long instance names.
- Environment variables prefixed with SINGULARITYENV\_ always take
precedence over variables without SINGULARITYENV\_ prefix.
- The %post build section inherits environment variables from the base
image.
- %files from ... will now follow symlinks for sources that are directly
specified, or directly resolved from a glob pattern. It will not follow
symlinks found through directory traversal. This mirrors Docker
multi-stage COPY behaviour.
- Restored the CWD mount behaviour of v2, implying that CWD path is not
recreated inside container and any symlinks in the CWD path are not
resolved anymore to determine the destination path inside container.
- The %test build section is executed the same manner as singularity test
image.
--fusemount with the container: default directive will foreground the
FUSE process. Use container-daemon: for previous behavior.
- Deprecate -a / --all option to sign/verify as new signature behavior
makes this the default.
- For more information about upstream changes, please check:
<https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>
- Removed --name flag for cache clean; replaced with --days.

# CVE-2019-11328

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11324.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11331.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11328 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11328)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Singularity 3.1.0 to 3.2.0-rc2, a malicious user with local/network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure permissions allowing a user to edit files within `/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`. The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host.

Maintaining Open Source Singularity Since 2017

# Security Policy

## Focus on Security

A lot rides on Singularity.

If you are an open source user, developer or Sylabs™ customer, we take security very seriously, our goal is to provide all Singularity users with the best-possible assistance regarding any issue that might affect the security of their systems.

Some of the biggest HPC centers on the planet depend on Singularity containers every day to run mission-critical applications. As stewards of the open source Singularity project, we owe it to the community to establish a clear security procedure for the times when vulnerabilities are reported or discovered.

### Do you think you found a vulnerability?

It’s easy to assume that your software is secure, but at Sylabs™, we continuously test the current open source version of Singularity for vulnerabilities.

If you believe **you have discovered a vulnerability** in Singularity, let us know so we can research it! You can notify our team either:

* **via email**: security@sylabs.io ([PGP key](sylabs-security.pub))
* **via web**: fill out the form on our [contact page](/contact-us)

We encourage people who contact Singularity Security team to use email encryption. [Get our PGP public key](sylabs-security.pub) and verify the fingerprint:

`0x0EEDA03B2CF74611AE99A09FB20868209CA9540F`

### The goals of a standardized security response procedure

Before we cover the procedure that Sylabs™ takes to mitigate newly discovered vulnerabilities, let’s talk about the goals we’re trying to achieve.

**Fast turnaround:**Even vulnerabilities that have not been announced publicly are a potential source of danger because a savvy hacker may be able to discover and exploit them independently. Our procedures are designed to first understand and then quickly remediate as primary goals.

**Limited exposure:** Before patches are developed and made available, our goal is to limit the spread of information until after a patch is available and key stakeholders are protected.

**Transparency:**The open-source community must know exactly what Sylabs™ intends to do about vulnerabilities and how we are are carrying out our commitment to security. Vulnerabilities are documented using the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system to provide a permanent searchable record allowing administrators to accurately judge the risks of running a particular version of Singularity within their environment.

**Enable stakeholders over malicious actors:**When a new vulnerability is publicly announced, a race begins between system administrators and those with nefarious intent. SingularityPRO subscribers are provided security patches prior to security announcements as a crucial head start in the security race. Although patches are made available to SingularityPRO customers first, those patches are provided without releasing security-related information. This limits exposure to the open source community while still providing a way to remediation for SingularityPRO customers, with a level of proactive measure.

### Sylabs™ vulnerability procedure

When a vulnerability is discovered, Sylabs™ takes the following steps:

1. Perform due diligence to fully replicate and describe the scope and severity of the bug. (This step is expected to take hours, not days.)
2. A CVE number is requested and embargoed until public release is made.
3. Security patch(es) are confidentially developed. (This step is expected to take hours or days and will be carried out with appropriate urgency.)
4. Security patches are merged into test versions of SingularityPRO and Sylabs™’ testing commences. Bugs related to patch(es) are fixed and testing is repeated as necessary. (This process is expected to take days.)
5. Once patch(es) are developed and fully tested, they are pushed to the main Singularity Pro repos.
6. SingularityPRO customers will receive a standard notification that there is a new version of Singularity available and they should upgrade. This notice will NOT contain any sensitive information and will NOT disclose the presence of a security-related patch.
7. Singularity Pro customers are given a reasonable amount of time to upgrade their installations so that when details of the exploit are revealed they are already protected.
8. After a reasonable period of time has elapsed and SingularityPRO customers have likely upgraded, the patches will be merged from the private development space into the public repository and a release will immediately be made. The release notes will do the following:

   1. Describe the issue in sufficient detail so that affected parties can judge whether to upgrade.
   2. If there is a mitigation or workaround detail it. If there is not explicitly say there is no known workaround.
   3. State whether a malicious user needs access to the system to exploit the vulnerability or whether it can be exploited remotely.
   4. State which versions of Singularity are affected and which OS-es/kernels are affected.
   5. Reference relevant CVE number(s).
9. At the same time that a release is being made, the CVE(s) will be filled out with all relevant information and released from embargo.
10. Announcements will be made on Slack and Google Group that a new version of Singularity is available with all relevant security information and links to release notes.
11. SingularityPRO customers will receive follow-up notification that the last version contains security patches and they should double check that they have upgraded. This email should contain the same information that is in the release notes (along with notifications in Sylabs™ customer support portal.)

Note: All security fixes that Sylabs™ creates will also be made available to the open source community when the full disclosure/CVE have been made public. This will include any patches that are created for legacy versions of Singularity that are no longer being actively maintained by the community.

### Continual Improvements

This security procedure is intended as a guideline and not a one-size fits all mandate. Situations will undoubtedly arise where these steps won’t apply cleanly. But the collective experience of the open source community and the Sylabs™ team, as well as our recent patching efforts lead us to believe this is a well-conceived plan.

# Execution Control List (ECL) Is Insecure

High

[dtrudg](/dtrudg)
published
GHSA-pmfr-63c2-jr5c
Jul 14, 2020

## Package

singularity

## Affected versions

All 3.x <3.6.0

## Patched versions

3.6.0

## Description

### Impact

The Singularity Execution Control List (ECL) allows system administrators to set up a policy that defines rules about what signature(s) must be (or must not be) present on a SIF container image for it to be permitted to run.

In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, the following issues allow the ECL to be bypassed by a malicious user:

* Image integrity is not validated when an ECL policy is enforced.
* The fingerprint required by the ECL is compared against the signature object descriptor(s) in the SIF file, rather than to a cryptographically validated signature. Thus, it is trivial to craft an arbitrary payload which will be permitted to run, even if the attacker does not have access to the private key associated with the fingerprint(s) configured in the ECL.

### Patches

These issues are addressed in Singularity 3.6.0.

All users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.0. Note that Singularity 3.6.0 uses a new signature format that is necessarily incompatible with Singularity < 3.6.0 - e.g. Singularity 3.5.3 cannot verify containers signed by 3.6.0.

Version 3.6.0 includes a `legacyinsecure` option that can be set to `legacyinsecure = true` in `ecl.toml` to allow the ECL to perform verification of the older, and insecure, legacy signatures for compatibility with existing containers. This does not guarantee that containers have not been modified since signing, due to other issues in the legacy signature format. The option should be used only to temporarily ease the transition to containers signed with the new 3.6.0 signature format.

### Workarounds

This issue affects any installation of Singularity configured to use the Execution Control List (ECL) functionality. There is no workaround if ECL is required.
