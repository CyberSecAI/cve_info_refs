{
  "CVE-2020-13845": {
    "Description": "In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, issues allow the ECL to be bypassed by a malicious user. Image integrity is not validated when an ECL policy is enforced. The fingerprint required by the ECL is compared against the signature object descriptor(s) in the SIF file, rather than to a cryptographically validated signature.",
    "Root cause": "Improper validation of an Integrity Check Value.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of signature during ECL enforcement"
    ],
    "Impact": "Bypass of the Execution Control List (ECL) policy, allowing execution of arbitrary, potentially malicious, container images.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious user can craft a container image with an arbitrary payload, which bypasses signature validation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create or modify SIF container images and run them in an environment where the ECL is enforced."
  },
  "CVE-2020-13846": {
    "Description": "In Singularity 3.5 the --all / -a option to singularity verify returns success even when some objects in a SIF container are not signed, or cannot be verified.",
    "Root cause": "Singularity 3.5 fails to report an error in a Status Code when some objects in a SIF container are not signed or cannot be verified.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect error reporting during signature verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "A signed container might be considered valid even when it has been modified or contains unsigned components, which could lead to unexpected or malicious behavior.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a SIF container with unsigned or unverifiable components which would still pass verification when using the `--all`/`-a` option.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create or modify SIF container images and run verification on them."
  },
    "CVE-2020-13847": {
    "Description": "In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, Singularity's sign and verify commands do not sign metadata found in the global header or data object descriptors of a SIF file, allowing an attacker to cause unexpected behavior. A signed container may verify successfully, even when it has been modified in ways that could be exploited to cause malicious behavior.",
    "Root cause": "Singularity's sign and verify commands do not sign metadata found in the global header or data object descriptors of a SIF file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient signature coverage"
    ],
   "Impact": "An attacker can modify metadata in the SIF file that could cause unexpected and potentially malicious behavior, while still passing verification. This means a signed container may have been modified.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can modify the SIF container metadata in the global header or data object descriptors after signing. The modified container would still pass signature verification.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to modify SIF container images and run verification on them."
