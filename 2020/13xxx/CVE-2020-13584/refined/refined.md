Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `ImageDecoderGStreamer` interface within WebKitGTK. This occurs due to improper handling of the `ImageDecoderGStreamer` object during the initialization of an `<image>` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The `ImageDecoderGStreamer` object is deallocated prematurely when the `CacheImage` component detects an invalid image format. However, a dangling pointer remains, and subsequent attempts to access this freed memory lead to the vulnerability.
- **Lack of Proper Reference Counting:** The code does not clear or validate the reference to `ImageDecoderGStreamer` before its subsequent use within the `ImageDecoder`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this use-after-free vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can also lead to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious web page containing an `<image>` tag with the following conditions:
    - The mimetype of a data URL is set to one of the mimetypes supported by `GStreamer` decoder, or
    - The URL points to a resource with a content type supported by the `GStreamer` decoder.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the malicious web page using a vulnerable version of WebKitGTK.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker must be able to host a malicious web page.
- **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges on the victim's system are needed.
- **User Action:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to visit the malicious page, typically through social engineering or other methods.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in WebKitGTK versions prior to 2.30.3.
- The provided crash information shows that the vulnerability manifests when an invalid image format is encountered, and the `ImageDecoderGStreamer` is prematurely freed.
- The Talos report provides a detailed call stack analysis of both the allocation, deallocation, and use-after-free conditions.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the use of a data URL or URL that leads to an unsupported format with `GStreamer` support.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with CVSSv3 score of 8.8
