Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** IP Whitelist bypass

**Product:** Knock Knock Plugin for Craft CMS

**Version:** < 1.2.8

**Root Cause:** The IP whitelist mechanism improperly uses the `X-Forwarded-For` header for IP address comparison, instead of the actual client IP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The plugin relies on the `X-Forwarded-For` header, which can be easily manipulated by a malicious actor.
- The plugin doesn't validate that the IP address from `X-Forwarded-For` is actually the client IP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass IP-based access restrictions by spoofing their IP address in the `X-Forwarded-For` header, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to protected resources, potentially including the Craft CMS control panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with modified headers to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to know the IP addresses that are whitelisted.

**Technical Details:**
- A whitelisted IP, e.g., `4.5.6.7`, is bypassed by sending a request with the `X-Forwarded-For: 4.5.6.7` header.
- The plugin checks this header, not the actual source IP address of the request.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Paweł Hałdrzyński.
- The vendor released a fix in version 1.2.8 on May 20, 2020.
- The public disclosure was on May 25, 2020.
- The changelog entry confirms the fix and also mentions an open-redirect vulnerability also reported by the same person and fixed in the same version.
