The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13828.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input validation and output encoding in Dolibarr CRM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the application. This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites, impacting the confidentiality and integrity of the application and its users.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are through multiple HTTP POST requests targeting vulnerable parameters within the application. These include parameters like `label`, `name_alias`, `customcode`, `subject`, `societe`, `address`, `message`, and `barcode` on various pages of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Dolibarr CRM. The attacker can then inject malicious payloads into the vulnerable parameters when creating or updating records. The attacker can then trigger the malicious script by navigating to a page displaying the injected content.
