- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default file system permissions assigned to critical files and directories by the Moxa MXView series installation. Specifically, the "Users" group has full write permissions to files and directories which are later executed by a service running with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **CWE-276 Incorrect Default Permissions:** The software grants excessive permissions to the "Users" group on several critical files and directories. This allows any user to modify or replace them.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve local privilege escalation to SYSTEM level by:
    - Modifying the JavaScript source file (`bundle.js` or `mosquitto_start.js`) to inject arbitrary code.
    - Replacing the `mosquitto.exe` executable or other executables/DLLs with malicious ones.
    - In both cases, the modified/replaced files will be executed by the MXView service running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, granting the attacker SYSTEM level access.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access is required. An attacker with write access to the affected files/directories can escalate privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have local access to the machine where the vulnerable Moxa MXView software is installed.
    - The attacker must be able to write to the directories/files specified, which is achievable by any user in the "Users" group.
