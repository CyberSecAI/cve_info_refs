Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The issue arises from an incorrect implementation of property key queries for Proxy objects in JerryScript. Specifically, when querying for property keys on a Proxy object, the implementation incorrectly returned all keys, including symbol keys, even when only non-symbol keys were requested.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of property key requests for Proxy objects.
- Failure to differentiate between symbol and non-symbol keys during property key retrieval for Proxy objects.
- This can lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with Proxy objects and incorrect results from `Object.keys()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The incorrect key retrieval can result in unexpected behavior in applications that rely on correct key filtering, such as when serializing/deserializing Javascript objects.
- The specific instance detailed in the issue report involves an assertion failure that leads to a crash of the JerryScript interpreter. The crash occurs during stringification of a Proxy object, specifically when the implementation attempts to get a string from a value that is not a string, indicating that the incorrect keys are being processed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any JavaScript code that creates a Proxy object and then attempts to use `Object.keys()` or a similar method that retrieves property keys.
- The provided test case demonstrates the vulnerability being triggered through a combination of Proxy and `JSON.stringify()` calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code in an environment that utilizes the vulnerable version of JerryScript.
- No specific network access or privileges are required beyond the ability to execute JavaScript.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes both the pull request fixing the issue (3797) and the original issue report (3787) describing the problem.
- The issue is specifically related to the handling of symbol keys with Proxy objects.
- The fix involved correcting the logic in the property key retrieval for Proxy objects to filter out symbol keys as requested.
- The pull request includes comments and code changes which provide additional context.
- The issue was labeled as a 'bug', 'Undesired behaviour' and 'ES2015'.
