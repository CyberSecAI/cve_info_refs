- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs when calculating the buffer size for a record of type 0x002a in a TextMaker Document file. A 32-bit length read from the file is multiplied by 0x23c. If this multiplication overflows, a smaller buffer than intended is allocated on the heap. Subsequently, during parsing, the application attempts to read and write data into this undersized buffer based on the original 32 bit length read from file, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow, heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application due to the heap overflow, potentially leading to system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by enticing a user to open a specially crafted TextMaker Document (.tmd) file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious .tmd document and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable software.
