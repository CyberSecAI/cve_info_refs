Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the usage of a **hardcoded `machineKey`** within the MyLittleAdmin application. This key is used for encryption and decryption of data, specifically for serializing and deserializing objects. The hardcoded key is located in the `web.config` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Cryptographic Key:** The primary weakness is the presence of a static, hardcoded `machineKey`. This means that all instances of MyLittleAdmin share the same key.
*   **Unauthenticated Deserialization:** Attackers can exploit this by creating malicious serialized .NET objects that, when processed by the application, allow arbitrary code execution. Since the key is known, an attacker can generate validly signed objects.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The exploit does not require authentication, meaning any attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By achieving RCE, the attacker can potentially take full control of the server, access sensitive data, and install malware.
*  **Context:** The commands are executed within the context of the IIS application engine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is performed over the network, targeting a publicly accessible web service.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack involves sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system hosting the vulnerable MyLittleAdmin instance.
*   **Knowledge of Hardcoded Key:** The attacker must know the hardcoded `machineKey` to create a valid malicious serialized object. This information is publicly available and was disclosed in the provided exploit.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP POST requests with specific data.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** MyLittleAdmin version 3.8 is confirmed to be vulnerable, and older versions are suspected to be vulnerable as well.
*   **Vendor Response:** The vendor did not respond to attempts to contact them.
*   **Workaround:** A workaround involves generating a new `machineKey` in IIS and resetting IIS.
*   **Exploit:** The provided Python script demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted payload that executes `calc.exe` on the remote server. The script retrieves necessary values such as `__VIEWSTATEGENERATOR` and `__EVENTVALIDATION` from the web page, before injecting the malicious payload, including the ysoserial generated shellcode.
