{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a page, leading to stored cross-site scripting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to inject malicious script through a vulnerable input field or other method of user provided content",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to input and store content into the vulnerable application, and have a victim view the stored, malicious content"
