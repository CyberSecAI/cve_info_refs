Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from GitLab's failure to invalidate existing user sessions upon activation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). When a user enables 2FA, older, unauthenticated sessions remain active, bypassing the intended security controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Management Flaw:** GitLab does not properly manage user sessions in relation to 2FA status changes.
*   **Bypass of 2FA:** Existing sessions can be used without needing 2FA after it's been activated, effectively negating the additional security layer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially use older, unauthenticated sessions to gain access to a user's GitLab account even after 2FA has been enabled.
*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** Attackers could leverage this access to view, modify, or delete sensitive data within the GitLab environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Pre-2FA Session Hijacking:** If an attacker had gained access to a user's session (e.g., via cookie theft) before 2FA was enabled, the session would remain valid post-2FA activation, allowing continued access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs an active session of the victim's GitLab account prior to the activation of 2FA. This could be obtained through various means like session hijacking, malware, or other attack methods targeting a user's active session.
