# Previously created sessions remain active after activating 2FA

**[HackerOne report #676772](https://hackerone.com/reports/676772)** by `xanbanx` on 2019-08-19, assigned to `jmatos_bgtvf`:

### Summary

I found a security problem related to your 2FA implementation. GitLab does not purge user sessions when 2FA gets activated. Instead, they are kept alive without 2FA ever was needed for them.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create 2 session on two devices now named session A and B
2. On session A, go to the user settings and activate 2FA
3. On session B, reload the page. Session B is still active although it was not logged in with 2FA and can use GitLab normally.

### Impact

Sessions without 2FA are kept alive when 2FA gets activated. So these sessions are still usable although 2FA was activated.

### Examples

This happens on gitlab.com

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Older sessions are kept active when 2FA gets activated.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

When 2FA gets activated, all older sessions should be purged forcing them to re-login with 2FA.

## Impact

See above.
