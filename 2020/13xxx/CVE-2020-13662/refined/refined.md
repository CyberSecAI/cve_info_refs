- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of the `destination` query parameter in the `drupal_goto()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirect
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a user into visiting a specially crafted link which would redirect them to an arbitrary external URL.
- **Attack vectors:** A user is tricked into clicking a specially crafted link containing a malicious URL in the `destination` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious link with the vulnerable `destination` parameter. No specific privileges or access is required.
