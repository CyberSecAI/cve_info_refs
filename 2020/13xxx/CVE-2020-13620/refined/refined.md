Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the web administration panel of the FASTGate GPON router. Specifically, the web panel does not include anti-CSRF tokens in its requests which allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper CSRF mitigation techniques, such as synchronizer tokens or double-submit cookies.
-   **Vulnerable HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable action (disabling parental control) is performed via an HTTP GET request, which can be easily triggered by a malicious link. This is not an ideal practice.
-   **No Custom Headers:** The web panel does not enforce the use of custom headers, allowing for "simple" requests that are not subjected to preflight checks, therefore allowing CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can force an authenticated user's browser to perform unwanted actions on the router's administration panel.
-   **Configuration Changes:** Exploitation can lead to changes in the router's configuration, such as disabling parental controls, and other privileged actions.
-   **Potential for Full Control:** If the user is an administrator, the attacker may gain full control over the router, potentially affecting network security.
-    **Login CSRF:** An attacker could potentially use CSRF to force a user to log in to an account they control, which could lead to the user's private information being stolen.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Links:** An attacker can embed a malicious request in a link (e.g. via email, chat) and trick the user into clicking it.
-   **Hidden Forms:** An attacker can create a webpage with a hidden form that automatically submits a malicious request to the vulnerable router upon page load.
-   **Embedded Scripts/iframes:** Attackers can plant malicious script or iframes on pages likely to be visited by the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Attacker Controlled Server:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious HTML code (e.g. "csrf.html").
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting the malicious page while the victim is logged into the router's administration panel.
-  **Network Access (optional):** While the exploit can be crafted off-site, the attacker needs the victim to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or that their traffic has a route to the routerâ€™s address.

**Additional Notes from Content:**

*   **Affected Systems:** FASTGate GPON Model FGA2130FWB through 2020-05-26 is affected.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was eventually fixed by the vendor by implementing CSRF protection, specifically through the use of a custom X-XSRF-TOKEN header.
*  **Defense-in-depth:** The OWASP cheat sheet recommends using multiple layers of protection, including synchronizer tokens, double-submit cookies, custom headers, SameSite cookies, origin validation, and user interaction based protection. The content also notes that XSS can bypass all CSRF mitigation techniques.
*   **Client-Side CSRF:** The content highlights the existence of client-side CSRF, where malicious inputs to JavaScript code can generate forged requests, bypassing traditional CSRF protections.
