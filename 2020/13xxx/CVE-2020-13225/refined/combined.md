## Description

![@wjmccann](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475445?u=d73982d6e18f497d3abfb0747896d2847c39ebe4&v=4&size=48)[wjmccann](https://github.com/wjmccann)opened [on May 17, 2020](https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/issues/3025#issue-619669375)

Version: 1.4

Within the Edit User Instructions field where you can enter source code you are able to generate scripting that then executes in the user's browser when they click on the instructions page.

POC:

 `<body onload=alert(1)></body>`

Additionally,

`<a href=# onmouseover=alert(1)>Text</a>`

will also execute scripting in the browser.

POC video is available here: <https://youtu.be/SpFmM03Jl40>
