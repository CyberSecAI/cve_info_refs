The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13225.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Edit User Instructions" field within the phpipam application. This field allows users to input arbitrary code, which is then executed in the browser of other users viewing the instructions page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. The application fails to properly encode or sanitize user-provided input before rendering it in the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "User Instructions" field. When other users view this page, the injected script will execute within their browsers. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including:

*   **Session hijacking:** Attacker can steal user session cookies and gain access to the user account.
*   **Malware distribution:** Attacker can redirect users to malicious sites or download malware.
*   **Phishing:** Attacker can display fake login forms to steal user credentials.
*   **Data theft:** Attacker can steal sensitive data displayed on the page.
*   **Website defacement:**  Attacker can alter the website content seen by users.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Edit User Instructions" field. An attacker with the ability to edit these instructions can inject malicious scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to edit the "User Instructions" field. This typically requires a user account with sufficient privileges within the phpipam application.
