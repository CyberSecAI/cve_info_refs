  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly restrict access to administrative functionalities, allowing lower-privileged users to access them via forceful browsing by directly entering the URL for admin pages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Privilege Escalation",
      "Inadequate Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged user (viewer) can gain access to administrative functionalities, such as creating invoices, quotes, orders, adding accounts, and more. This allows them to perform actions they are not authorized for, potentially leading to data manipulation and unauthorized financial activities.",

      "Forceful Browsing",
      "Direct URL Access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with viewer privileges. They must be able to log in to the application with these credentials."
