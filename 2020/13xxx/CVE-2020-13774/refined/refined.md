{
  "CVE-2020-13774": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper file extension validation during file uploads in Ivanti Unified Endpoint Manager's web management console.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The main weakness is insufficient file extension validation. The security controls are implemented client-side and can be easily bypassed. Additionally, the insecure handling of uploaded image files, specifically temporary files created during the upload process that are left in an accessible location, contributes to the vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to upload and execute arbitrary ASP.NET (.aspx) files on the Microsoft IIS server within the context of the web application. This leads to remote code execution (RCE) on the server, which can allow for complete system compromise.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote and requires network access to the vulnerable web management console. An attacker needs to be authenticated to the application to upload malicious .aspx files.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the Ivanti Unified Endpoint Manager's web management console. They also need to be either part of the 'LANDesk Administrators' group or part of the 'Landesk Management Suite' group and be assigned to the 'Software Distribution' role."
