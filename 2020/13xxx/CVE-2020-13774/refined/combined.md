### Find the answers you need

- Gmail has always had strong security as a foundation. We work hard to protect you from spam, phishing, and malware, before they reach your inbox. Our AI-enhanced spam-filtering capabilities block nearly 10 million spam emails every minute.
- No. While you may see ads in your no-cost Gmail account, your emails are private. Google does not scan or process Gmail content for advertising purposes.
- While Gmailâs features are secure enough for most users, some accounts may require additional layers of safety. Google's Advanced Protection Program safeguards users with high visibility and sensitive information, who are at risk of targeted online attacks.

  Learn more
- Gmail is part of Google Workspace where you can choose from different plans. In addition to what you love about Gmail, you get a custom email address (@yourcompany.com), unlimited group email addresses, 99.9% guaranteed uptime, twice the storage of personal Gmail, zero ads, 24/7 support, Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook, and more.

Conditional Access Policies (CAPs) are the core of Entra ID’s perimeter defense for the vast majority of Enterprise Microsoft 365 (M365) and Azure environments. The core ideas of conditional access are: Require specific auth strength in scenarios where you wish to grant access Block access in undesirable scenarios If a scenario are neither covered by a or b, then the minimal auth strength (password) would be sufficient A special condition for CAP requirements is that authentication can be required to come from an “Intune Compliant” device (also known as “company managed” to the user), otherwise the authentication would be unsuccessful. In our adversarial engagements, more hardened M365 environments often have this requirement for a large subset of cloud apps used by the company, making running post-exploitation Entra ID tools like GraphRunner, RoadRecon, Teamfiltration, etc. difficult....

I am old enough to remember that it was not always possible to get domain admin within the first hour of a test via Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) misconfigurations or over permissioned SCCM NAA accounts. At present we are spoilt for choice in regards to privilege escalation vectors within the on-premise AD environment's, but I wanted to take a look at some of the other...

In my formative days of learning network hacking, SSH tunnelling was amongst the first tunnelling techniques that I learnt. I still remember trying to repeatedly decode my notes and diagrams on the rather cumbersome syntax of single port forwarding with the -L and -R flags, which at the time was taught as “the way to do it”. If your foothold is (luckily) a Linux server, then you’re blessed with...

# Advisory CVE-2020-13774 – Ivanti Unified Endpoint Manager authenticated RCE via file upload

by xnand | Nov 12, 2020 | [Jumpsec](https://labs.jumpsec.com/category/jumpsec/), [Research](https://labs.jumpsec.com/category/research/)

**Software**: Ivanti Endpoint Manager
**Affected Versions**: <= 2020.1; <= 2019.1.3
**Vendor page**: www.ivanti.com
**CVE Reference**: CVE-2020-13774
**Published**: 12/11/2020
**CVSS 3.1 Score**: 9.9 – [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)
**Attack Vector**: Remote, authenticated
**Credits**: Andrei Constantin Scutariu, Lenk Ratchakrit, Calvin Yau

Summary

Improper validation on file upload functionality present in Ivanti Unified Endpoint Manager’s web management console permits an authenticated user to upload .aspx files and execute them on the MS IIS server’s context. The issue is caused by insufficient file extension validation and insecure file operations on the uploaded image, which upon failure will leave the temporarily created files in an accessible location on the server.

Solution

The issue has been successfully resolved by the vendor in version 2020.1.1. Customers can install the latest available software update to fix the vulnerability. The vendor also communicated this has also been fixed in version 2019.1.4, although this has not been verified by JUMPSEC.

Technical details

The “/LDMS/softwaredistribution/EditLaunchPadDialog.aspx” URL permits the upload of an image file on the server. Security controls on the file extension are implemented client-side and can thus be easily bypassed. By crafting a proper .ico image file containing ASP code and uploading it with .aspx extension, it is later possible to access and execute the malicious file on “/landesk/files/<filename>.aspx”.

The user must be authenticated and either part of “LANDesk Admnistrators” group or both part of “Landesk Management Suite” group and be assigned to the “Software Distribution” role in order to access the vulnerable component.

Timeline

15/04/2020: Issue reported to the vendor
16/04/2020: Vendor acknowledged the issues
02/06/2020: CVE number assigned from MITRE
13/07/2020: 90 days notice period for disclosure given to the vendor
12/11/2020: Advisory published by JUMPSEC

## What is ‘Personal Data’?

The GDPR applies to ‘personal data’, meaning any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified from that information.

## How do we collect personal data?

We collect personal data about you if you use our website, if you contact us about products and services, at events, if you’re a customer or supplier.

## What type of personal data is collected and processed?

We collect and process the following personal data:

* Name and job title
* Contact information including email address
* Other information relevant to our products and services.

## What are our lawful bases for processing personal data?

The GDPR demands that we have a valid lawful basis to process personal data. There are six available legal bases for processing. We rely on at least one of the following legal bases when we collect personal data in the ways described above:

* Your consent, which is explicitly given and can be easily withdrawn
* A legitimate interest, ours and / or yours. If you ask us for information, it is in your legitimate interest that we process your personal data. If we have a contractual relationship with you, it is in both our legitimate interests that we process your personal data.

## How do we use personal data?

JUMPSEC uses personal data for the following reasons:

* To respond to explicit requests about our products and services
* To improve our products and services
* To manage our employees, suppliers, clients, contractors, prospects, and contacts
* To maintain our own accounts and records
* To inform you of IT-related and JUMPSEC news, events, activities, and services.

## How long do we keep personal data?

We keep personal data so long as we have consent to keep it or legitimate interest in keeping it.

## What will we not do with personal data?

* We will not share your personal data with others unless they have a legitimate interest in it or we are required by law to share it.
* We will not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area or to any international organisation without prior written content.

## How secure is the personal data we process?

JUMPSEC is committed to ensuring that personal data is secure. Personal data is treated as strictly confidential.

To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, technical, and managerial controls to safeguard and secure personal data.

## What are your rights in relation to your personal data?

The GDPR gives individuals the following rights in relation to their personal data:

* The right to be informed about the collector, collection, and processing of your personal data (which is what we are doing in this Privacy Policy)
* The right to access their personal data, i.e. you can ask us for a copy of your personal data. We must respond to such requests within one month
* The right to rectification, i.e. you can ask us to amend your personal data if it is inaccurate or out of date. We must respond to such requests within one month
* The right to request that your personal data be erased where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing
* The right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data if you contest its accuracy or the legitimacy of its processing
* The right to data portability, i.e. the right to request that we provide you with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format
* The right to object to the processing of personal data for legitimate interests, the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority, direct marketing, and/or scientific or historical research and statistics
* The right to escalate any data privacy complaints to the Information Commissioners’ Office.

## How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes, and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

## Links to other websites

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites, and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

## [Weaponize Your Word – Malicious Template Injection](https://labs.jumpsec.com/weaponize-your-word-malicious-template-injection/)

Weaponize Your Word - Malicious Template Injection Historically, files sent via email have been a common initial access technique employed by threat actors. Personally, I have seen emails containing malware prove effective, and in the case of an IR (Incident Response) involving a malware infection, it would be one of the first places I would look to identify the source of compromise. There are many techniques for bypassing an email solution to deploy malware on an endpoint, however an old...

by Bjoern Schwabe | Aug 6, 2024 | [Jumpsec](https://labs.jumpsec.com/category/jumpsec/), [Research](https://labs.jumpsec.com/category/research/)

If you are a pentester you probably never really think about programming. Instead you are testing what others have developed. However, every now and then a quick python or bash script is needed to exploit some stuff you have found, or automate a certain process you are using.  Things become interesting when you are in a penetration testing company that has many strong penetration testers and everyone writes these scripts. Clearly each script solves a particular problem, either for the tester...

Writing custom DNS tunnelling protocol, exploiting unexpected AWS Lambda misconfiguration – in a web app Pen test (Part 2)](https://labs.jumpsec.com/whats-in-a-name-writing-custom-dns-tunnelling-protocol-exploiting-unexpected-aws-lambda-misconfiguration-in-a-web-app-pen-test-part-2/)

In Part 1 of the series we looked at how an AWS Lambda-powered feature was exploited in a web app penetration test initially leading to RCE and further on with out-of-band data exfiltration via DNS. Though the exact mechanism of achieving remote-code execution with Python was not discussed, we went in depth in how to return data as a result of the code being executed. Initially, with ascii-to-integer encoding I was able to find the username of the runtime user - sbx\_userNNN. In the first blog...

This is a war story of an AWS web application test where remote code execution was first obtained on the client's application. Then I needed to write my own DNS tunnelling 'protocol' to get the data out. Following a number of twists and turns I impersonated the application and attempted to laterally move within the AWS tenant. Before storytelling though, let's start with a public service announcement: The Public Service Announcement As the title suggests, I discovered that it was possible to...

TL;DR Max Corbridge (@CorbridgeMax) and Tom Ellson (@tde\_sec) of JUMPSEC’s Red Team recently discovered a vulnerability in the latest version of Microsoft Teams which allows for the possible introduction of malware into any organisations using Microsoft Teams in its default configuration. This is done by bypassing client-side security controls which prevent external tenants from sending files (malware in this case) to staff in your organisation. JUMPSEC has detailed remediation options, as...

by Newt Tan | Nov 23, 2022 | [Detection](https://labs.jumpsec.com/category/detection/), [Research](https://labs.jumpsec.com/category/research/)

I recently worked on a project focused on log anomaly detection using manageable machine learning pipelines. The pipelines mainly include data collection --- feature extraction --- feature engineering --- detection/prediction --- updating (maintenance).  It’s important to have a solid UI to manage the pipelines so I can easily review the chain of pipelines. After much research, I found many engineers recommended Airflow.  In airflow, the core concept is the Directed Acyclic Graph...

Introduction I’ve recently spoken at several conferences about the changes that are underway within red teaming as a result of cloud migration. My team and I have been delivering majority cloud red team work over the last year and the differences are becoming more apparent by the day. One point I’ve mentioned as ‘controversial’ at several of these events is that cloud migration has actually made AppSec more important than ever. I went some way to trying to explain why I think this is during my...

### Find the answers you need

- Gmail has always had strong security as a foundation. We work hard to protect you from spam, phishing, and malware, before they reach your inbox. Our AI-enhanced spam-filtering capabilities block nearly 10 million spam emails every minute.
- No. While you may see ads in your no-cost Gmail account, your emails are private. Google does not scan or process Gmail content for advertising purposes.
- While Gmailâs features are secure enough for most users, some accounts may require additional layers of safety. Google's Advanced Protection Program safeguards users with high visibility and sensitive information, who are at risk of targeted online attacks.

  Learn more
- Gmail is part of Google Workspace where you can choose from different plans. In addition to what you love about Gmail, you get a custom email address (@yourcompany.com), unlimited group email addresses, 99.9% guaranteed uptime, twice the storage of personal Gmail, zero ads, 24/7 support, Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook, and more.
