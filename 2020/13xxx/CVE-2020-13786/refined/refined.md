Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-13786:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper CSRF protection in multiple web pages of the D-Link DIR-865L router's web interface. This allows an attacker to perform actions on the router without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in multiple pages of the router's web interface.
- The SharePort Web Access portal is also vulnerable to CSRF which is an administrative web site for file sharing located on port 8181.
- Session cookies, including the user ID (UID), are transmitted in cleartext, making them easy to steal.
- The web interface allows bypassing the login screen of the SharePort web access portal by directly navigating to the `folder_view.php` page and manipulating the session cookie.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to password-protected portions of the router's website without knowing the password.
- The attacker can use stolen session information (cookies) to perform administrative actions on the router, such as:
    - Conducting command injection attacks as described in CVE-2020-13782.
    - Accessing the SharePort Web Access portal for file sharing.
    - Viewing, deleting, and uploading files through the SharePort Web Access portal.
- The attacker can potentially upload malware, download sensitive files or delete essential files.
- They can bypass authentication by setting a valid session cookie

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can sniff web traffic to steal session cookies.
- Malicious websites or links can be used to trick users into making unauthorized requests to the router.
- The attacker can perform CSRF attacks using the stolen session cookies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic to obtain session cookies.
- The attacker can be an external user on the same network as the victim router.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject code using the CSRF vulnerability or simply make requests using the valid cookie obtained via sniffing.
