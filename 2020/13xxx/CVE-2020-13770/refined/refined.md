  "CVE-2020-13770": {
    "description": "Ivanti Unified Endpoint Manager named pipe token impersonation privilege escalation",
    "root_cause": "Several services are accessing named pipes with default or overly permissive security attributes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Named pipe access with default or overly permissive security attributes.",
       "Services running as 'NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM' are vulnerable."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation from a standard user or service account to 'NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM'.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access.",
      "Creating a named pipe server and waiting for a vulnerable service to connect as a client to extract its token."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Local standard or service account with SeImpersonatePrivilege (e.g. user 'NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE').",
        "Ability to create named pipe server."
    ],
    "affected_versions": "<= 2020.1.1",
    "technical_details": "The vulnerability is exploited by creating a named pipe server, waiting for a vulnerable service to connect as a client, extracting the clientâ€™s token, and using it to perform privileged actions as 'NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM'. To exploit it, the attacker might need to create the named pipe before the legitimate process or cause it to crash. Affected named pipes include \\\\.\\pipe\\SQLLocal\\ldmsdata."
