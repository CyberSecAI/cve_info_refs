About Affected Software

---

Express Accounts is professional business accounting software, perfect for small businesses needing to document and report on incoming and outgoing cash flow including sales, receipts, payments and purchases.

Additional Information

NCH express Accounts software allows to access it over the web.

The administrator user has access to all modules including Create new invoice, Create new quote, Create new sales order, Create new purchase order, Apply customers payment, View Credit notes, Enter new account payable, view chart of accounts, Make a payment, Receive a payment, Add new item, Add new customer, Supliers list, Add/Edit users

User with viewer privileges don’t have access to above mentioned functionalities by forceful browsing, we will access admin modules using viewer user privileges

Exploit

---

I have created below users for POC

Admin user: admin@tejas.com
Viewer user: lowuser@tejas.com
As demonstred in video “chart of accounts” has only one entry and  lowuser@tejas.com dont have access to “chart of accounts” functionality (or any other module mentioned above) reference video [2:14 min]

login as low privileged user and enter below url

http://[website:port]/acclist

Click add new account

fill all details click okay

Via forceful browsing we were able to add entry as low user

Similerly below via forceful browsing we can access below mentioned functions

Add New Invoice: http://[website:port]/invoiceprop?onok=invoicelist&oncancel=invoicelist

Add New Quote: http://[website:port]/quoteprop?onok=quotelist&oncancel=quotelist
