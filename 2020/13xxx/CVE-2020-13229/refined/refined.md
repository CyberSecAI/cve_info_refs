Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2020-13229:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the usage of the `sid` parameter in the `/scgi` URI as an authentication token, which is transmitted in the GET request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an incorrect access control issue. Specifically, it's a session fixation vulnerability. The server does not properly validate the origin of the session ID (`sid`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can hijack a user's session. By observing the `sid` value in a legitimate user's `/scgi` URI, the attacker can use this `sid` in their own browser session to gain unauthorized access to the user's account. The attacker would not need to authenticate.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `/scgi` URI and observing the `sid` parameter value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to observe a legitimate user's `/scgi` URI with the `sid` parameter, this can be through network sniffing or other methods of intercepting the user's request. The attacker does not need any valid credentials.
