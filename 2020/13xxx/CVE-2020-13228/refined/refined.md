Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `sid` parameter of the `/scgi` endpoint in Sysax MultiServer 6.90.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application directly reflects the value of the `sid` parameter in the response without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `sid` parameter. When a user visits the crafted URL, the injected script executes in their browser within the context of the vulnerable web application.
- **Session Hijacking:** XSS can be used for session hijacking.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive user data.
- **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect to phishing pages.
- **Defacement:** The web page can be defaced by the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a specifically crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload in the `sid` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure a victim to click on the malicious link through social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the Sysax MultiServer.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to trick users into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The content includes a PoC (Proof of Concept) URL demonstrating the reflected XSS vulnerability with an example of how to embed the script code.
- The content also provides a screenshot of the PoC execution that validates the successful exploitation of this vulnerability.
