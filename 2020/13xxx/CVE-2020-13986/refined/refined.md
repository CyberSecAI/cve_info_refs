      "Infinite Loop (CWE-835)",

    "impact": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker may cause denial of service, disclosure of private information, or execution of arbitrary code by sending specially crafted network packets.",
    "attack_vectors": "Specially crafted network packets.",
    "required_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerabilities are present in multiple open-source TCP/IP stacks commonly used in IoT and embedded devices, including: uIP, Contiki-OS, Contiki-NG, PicoTCP, PicoTCP-NG, FNET, and Nut/OS. The vulnerabilities are due to improper memory management during processing of network packets. The impact is highly dependent on the specific implementation, however, a successful exploit can result in remote code execution, information disclosure and denial of service. The lack of supply chain visibility makes assessing the true impact and potential exploitability difficult."
