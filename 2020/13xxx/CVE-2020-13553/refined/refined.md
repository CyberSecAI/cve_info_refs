The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13553.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect default file system permissions on a Node.js script file, `startServerByServerConfig.js`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `startServerByServerConfig.js` file, used by the Dashboard process, has write permissions for the "Everyone" group, allowing any user to modify its content.
- The `dashboard_start.exe` process executes the `startServerByServerConfig.js` script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `startServerByServerConfig.js` file. When the `dashboard_start.exe` process executes this script, the injected code will be run with the privileges of the user who started the dashboard process, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access to the file system is required to modify the vulnerable `startServerByServerConfig.js` file located in the `C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\broadweb\WADashboard\` directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to write to the `C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\broadweb\WADashboard\startServerByServerConfig.js` file. This is possible for any user since the Everyone group has full control over the file.
- An understanding of Node.js and how to inject malicious Javascript.
