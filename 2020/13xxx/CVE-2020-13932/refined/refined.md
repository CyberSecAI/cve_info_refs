- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specifically crafted MQTT packet with an XSS payload in the client-id or topic name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The XSS payload is injected into the admin console's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted MQTT packet to an Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker with the XSS payload in either client-id or topic name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send MQTT packets to the targeted Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker.
