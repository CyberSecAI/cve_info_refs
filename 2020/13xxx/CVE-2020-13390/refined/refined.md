{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Tenda router's web server (httpd). When processing the `entrys` and `mitInterface` parameters of a POST request, the values are directly used in a `sprintf` function call to a local variable on the stack, which leads to overwriting the function's return address.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can construct a payload to achieve arbitrary code execution. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) results in a denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/addressNat` with overly long `entrys` and `mitInterface` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web server. This typically implies network access to the router's web interface."
