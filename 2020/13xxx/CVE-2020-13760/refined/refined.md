- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing token checks in the `com_postinstall` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on the Joomla! site by tricking an authenticated user into submitting a crafted request. This could include actions related to the post-installation process.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could create a specially crafted web page or link, which when clicked by a logged-in Joomla! user, would trigger the vulnerable `com_postinstall` functionality without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in Joomla! administrator/user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious page.
