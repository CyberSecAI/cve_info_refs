```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the fact that todos for confidential issues and merge requests are not redacted when a user's membership changes from a higher access level to a lower access level (e.g., from Repository to Guest).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control; failure to redact todos associated with confidential resources after a user's permissions have been reduced.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users with lower access levels can gain access to confidential issues and merge requests through their todo lists.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by first granting a user a high access level, having them create todos related to confidential issues and merge requests, then lowering their access level.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a user that had higher permissions within the project, then had their permissions lowered. They also need to have previously created todos related to confidential issues and MRs when they had higher access level."
