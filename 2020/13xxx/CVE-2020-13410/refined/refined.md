Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-13410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper error handling within the `writeNumberCached` function of the aedes MQTT broker when processing a crafted payload. This payload has a published header and message length of 0. Specifically, when trying to create a packet for Publish Release, the stream.write() function fails because the datatype becomes an undefined array with -1 as the packet ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper error handling: The application fails to manage errors correctly when processing specific invalid MQTT packets.
- Lack of input validation: The application doesn't validate the header and message length before processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the aedes MQTT broker, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specifically crafted MQTT payload: An attacker sends a malformed MQTT packet with a published header and message length set to 0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the MQTT broker.
- Knowledge of MQTT Protocol: The attacker needs some knowledge of the MQTT protocol to craft the specific malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue was implemented in this commit: https://github.com/moscajs/aedes/pull/493. The fix includes catching writeToStream errors, which prevents the server from crashing.
- The vulnerability was reported on May 18, 2020, and fixed on May 22, 2020.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Arun Magesh.
