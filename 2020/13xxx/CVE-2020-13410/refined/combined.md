Adding a unit test (even with a mock/proxyquire) would be nice.

| [@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina) I'm 👍 for the test but why this isn't working?  ``` // Catch invalid packet writeToStream errors test('reject client requested for unsupported protocol version', function (t) {   t.plan(3)    const broker = aedes()   t.tearDown(broker.close.bind(broker))    const s = setup(broker)    var packet = [     16, 22, 0, 4, 77, 81, 84, 84,     4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 10, 109, 121,     99, 108, 105, 101, 110, 116, 105, 100,     85, 0   ]    s.inStream.write(Buffer.from(packet))    s.outStream.on('data', function (packet) {     t.fail('no data sent')   })   broker.on('connectionError', function (client, err) {     t.equal(client.version, null)     t.equal(err.message, 'Unknown command')     t.equal(broker.connectedClients, 0)   }) }) ```  I mean, it works as test but it doesn't make that function throw  P.S: I asked to the guy of the email to try this fix and he told me that this has fixed the bug 🎉 |

| [@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina) I tried even that way and I'm not able to reproduce the problem, maybe I'm missing something |

| You should use proxyquire to mock writeToStream. |

| [@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina) I saw that if there are errors or client is no connecting/connected the write never calls `done` is this correct or should we also call `done(err)`? |
