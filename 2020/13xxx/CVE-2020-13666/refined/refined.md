- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Drupal AJAX API does not disable JSONP by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session, leading to various malicious activities such as data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting the fact that JSONP is not disabled by default in the Drupal AJAX API, an attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when processed by the AJAX API, lead to XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the URLs processed by Drupal's AJAX API. This could be through social engineering (e.g., tricking a user into clicking a malicious link), or by injecting malicious content into a website that uses the vulnerable Drupal AJAX API.
