Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when executing SQL queries in Ivanti Endpoint Manager (formerly LANDesk). This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple web components within the Ivanti Endpoint Manager application are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically:
    *   The `/LDMS/alert_log.aspx` endpoint, using the `filterValue` parameter, is vulnerable.
    *   The `/remotecontrolauth/api/device` endpoint, using the `global`, `displayname`, `ipaddress`, and `owner` parameters, is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the database, since the account used to query the database is a database administrator.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the database permissions, it could allow attackers to modify or delete data from the database.
*   **Loss of Availability:** It might be possible to cause denial of service by manipulating the database in such a way that it stops responding to queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Authenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any authenticated user of the Ivanti Endpoint Manager application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a user account on the Ivanti Endpoint Manager system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable web endpoints of the Ivanti Endpoint Manager system over the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Ivanti Endpoint Manager versions 2020.1 and earlier, as well as 2019.1.3 and earlier, are vulnerable.
*   **Vendor Solution:** Ivanti has addressed the issue in version 2020.1.1 and later. They also claim to have fixed it in 2019.1.4, although this was not verified by the reporting party.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are `filterValue` on the `/LDMS/alert_log.aspx` endpoint, and `global`, `displayname`, `ipaddress`, and `owner` on the `/remotecontrolauth/api/device` endpoint.
*   **Injection Types:** The vulnerability allows for various SQL injection types including stacked, time-based blind, and boolean-based blind injections.
*  **CVSS Score**: The article states a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
