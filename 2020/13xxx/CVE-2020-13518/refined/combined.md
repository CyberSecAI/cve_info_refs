# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1115

## NZXT CAM WinRing0x64 driver IRP 0x9c402084 information disclosure vulnerability

##### December 16, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13518

### Summary

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the WinRing0x64 Driver IRP 0x9c402084 functionality of NZXT CAM 4.8.0. A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can cause the disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

NZXT CAM 4.8.0

### Product URLs

<https://www.nzxt.com/camapp>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-269 - Improper Privilege Management

### Details

NZXT CAM is software designed as an all-in-one solution for computer hardware monitoring and performance. The software monitors fan speeds, CPU temperatures, network and RAM usage, as well as CPU/GPU frequencies for overclocking. It also has features for in-game overlays to track PC performance. The software also has an inventory for all devices that are installed on the PC at any given time.

The WinRing0x64 driver exists so that the NZXT CAM software can have access to the Windows Kernel as well as elevated privileges required to talk to PCI devices as well as making CPU/GPU configuration changes. This driver creates `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` that is accessible to any user on the system and this driver is used for all elevated tasks.

Using the IRP 0x9c402084 gives a low privilege user direct access to the `rdmsr` instruction that is completely unrestrained which allows reading of any MSR on the system. This access could be used for leak sensitive information about the processor.

00011483  eb0d               jmp     0x11492

```
### Exploit Proof of Concept

This proof of concept reads the MSR 0xC000\_0080 which is the Extended Feature Enable MSR (Core::X86::Msr::EFER)
