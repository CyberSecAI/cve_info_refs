Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the WinRing0x64 driver, specifically how it handles I/O request packets (IRPs) with the code `0x9c402084`. This IRP allows a low-privilege user to directly access the `rdmsr` instruction without any restrictions, enabling the reading of any Model Specific Register (MSR) on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The driver grants low-privilege users unrestrained access to the `rdmsr` instruction, which is a privileged operation.
- **Information Disclosure:** Unrestricted access to MSRs allows attackers to read sensitive processor information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary MSRs on the system.
- This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about the processor.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can send a specially crafted IRP with the code `0x9c402084` to the `\Device\WinRing0_1_2_0` device.
- This can be achieved by interacting with the device driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a low-privilege account on the targeted system.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the device driver interface.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable driver is `WinRing0x64.sys`.
- The driver is installed as part of the NZXT CAM software.
- The specific vulnerability lies in the function associated with IRP `0x9c402084`.
- The exploit proof of concept shows how to read the MSR `0xC000_0080` (Extended Feature Enable MSR).
