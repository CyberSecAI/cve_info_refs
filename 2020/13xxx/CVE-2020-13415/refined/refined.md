The provided content relates to CVE-2020-13415.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to XML Signature Wrapping in SAML, where an attacker with any signed SAML assertion from the Identity Provider can establish a connection. This is true even if the SAML assertion has expired or is from a user not authorized to access Aviatrix.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML Signature Wrapping in SAML. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow unauthorized access to Aviatrix services for users with any SAML assertion, even if expired or unauthorized.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to obtain any signed SAML assertion from the Identity Provider and use it to establish a connection to Aviatrix.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to obtain any signed SAML assertion from the Identity Provider.
