Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13580

**Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the PlanMaker document parsing functionality. The vulnerability occurs because the application reads a user-controlled 16-bit value and uses it as a length for a write operation without proper bounds checking. Specifically, after initially checking a value against a maximum allowed size, the program re-reads the value and uses it to perform a write operation, completely negating the initial size check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A buffer on the stack is overflowed due to an uncontrolled length value used in a write operation.
*   **Lack of proper bounds checking:**  While there is an initial size check, this check is bypassed due to a subsequent read of a user-controlled value used in the write operation.
*   **Trust of user-supplied length:** The application trusts a length value from a specific record type within a document without proper validation during the write operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By overwriting the saved return address on the stack, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.
*   **Memory corruption:** The overflow allows an attacker to corrupt arbitrary memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious document:** An attacker crafts a specially designed PlanMaker document (`.pmd`) containing a record of type `0x8010` with a manipulated length field.
*   **User interaction:** The victim is enticed into opening the malicious document using the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to create a malicious document:** The attacker needs to be able to create a crafted `.pmd` file containing a specific record type with a controlled size.
*   **Ability to deliver the document to the victim:** The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious document to the victim via email, shared network drive, or another method.
*   **Victim must use the vulnerable application:** The victim must be using a vulnerable version of SoftMaker Office PlanMaker and open the malicious document with it.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is located in the processing of the "PMW" stream within a PlanMaker document.
* The vulnerable code is in the handling of record type 0x8010.
* The overflow occurs when the application attempts to write 16-bit null bytes (`0x0000`) to a stack buffer using a length value derived from the document.
* The attacker can control the offset to write from -0x20(%rbp) using the manipulated length. The stack buffer is 0x20 bytes, and a stack canary exists, so a length value greater than 0x10 is needed to overwrite data outside the buffer.
* The proof of concept uses a length of 0x1c which, when multiplied by 2, causes a write to a location 0x28 bytes past the buffer, overwriting the return address on the stack with null bytes, leading to a crash at the address `0x0000000000680004`.
