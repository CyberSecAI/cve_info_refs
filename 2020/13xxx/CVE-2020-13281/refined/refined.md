{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of size checks before decompressing uploaded archive files during the import of GitLab projects, combined with the tar utility's default behavior of preserving file modification times during extraction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted decompression of user-provided files leading to a denial-of-service",
       "Lack of size limits during decompression",
       "Use of tar command without the '-m' flag, causing the file modification time to be preserved, which is later used for cleanup, and causes the uncompressed files to not be cleaned up by the cleanup worker because the time is set in the future."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload a specially crafted compressed file (a 'decompression bomb') that, when extracted, expands to consume excessive disk space, leading to a denial of service. This can result in a multitude of issues, including random 500 errors, inability to create/import projects, issues, or push git changes, inability to upload files, and overall site unavailability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading a malicious tar.gz file via the 'Import an exported GitLab project' functionality.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to upload a file to the GitLab instance via the import functionality. No specific privileges are explicitly stated but it's implied that a valid user account is needed. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious archive."
  },
  "additional_details": {
      "attack_description": "The attacker uploads a tar.gz file that is small in size but contains a large number of zero bytes when decompressed. The GitLab instance processes the file without checking the uncompressed size and therefore will write the large number of zero bytes to disk. By repeatedly uploading this file, the attacker can fill up the disk and cause a denial of service.",
      "mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing limits on the uncompressed size of imported files and ensuring that the '-m' flag is used when extracting tar archives, which prevents the original file modification times from being preserved."
