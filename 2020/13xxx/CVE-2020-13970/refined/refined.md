```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in Shopware versions 6.1.0 up to and including 6.2.2
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Authenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (NEXT-9176, NEXT-9240)
    - Authenticated Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (NEXT-9175)
    - Information Leakage when the development environment is active (NEXT-9174)
    - Session hijacking vulnerability of customer accounts in the storefront (NEXT-9569)
  - Impact of exploitation:
    - XSS: Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    - SSRF: Allows an attacker to make requests to internal resources or third-party systems through the vulnerable server, potentially exposing sensitive data or enabling further attacks.
    - Information Leakage: Exposes sensitive information when the development environment is active, which can aid attackers in further malicious activities.
    - Session Hijacking: Enables attackers to take control of customer accounts in the storefront, potentially leading to unauthorized purchases or data theft.
  - Attack vectors: Web-based attacks via malicious input or crafted requests.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For XSS and SSRF: Authenticated access to the Shopware platform is required.
    - For Information Leakage: Requires the development environment to be active
    - For Session hijacking: Exploiting a vulnerability in the storefront, potentially via crafted links or interaction with malicious content.
