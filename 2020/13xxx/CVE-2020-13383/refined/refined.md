Based on the provided content, this commit relates to a release update for version 7.4 of openSIS-Classic. However, the changes within this commit do not expose a security vulnerability or relate to CVE-2020-13383, so this commit is UNRELATED. The commit primarily focuses on:

-   Updating the version number in SQL files.
-   Modifying user input validation in Javascript files.
-   Minor changes in other php files

The Javascript changes are related to client side user input validation, but this is not related to the exploitation of any server side vulnerability. The changes are specifically focused on:

*   **`js/Ajaxload.js`**: The modifications in this file primarily enforce stricter username validation for staff and students, ensuring usernames adhere to specific character sets (letters, numbers, underscores, "@" and "."). It prevents usernames from being submitted if they contain invalid characters, are too short, or are already taken. This enhances input validation but does not address a security vulnerability in relation to CVE-2020-13383.
*   **`js/DivControl.js`**: The added functionality `checkAllDtMod2` is related to the selection/deselection of student labels and does not have security implications for CVE-2020-13383.

The other changed files involve minor adjustments such as adding the new version number and date in SQL files, modifications to the display of the calendar date, and small adjustments to the display of modules and menus.

There is no indication of a security vulnerability related to CVE-2020-13383 in this commit.
