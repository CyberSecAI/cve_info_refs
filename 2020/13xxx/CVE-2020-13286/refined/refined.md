```
{
  "Root cause": "The git clone command, generated by gitaly, includes a `-c` flag to add the Authorization header, but it improperly handles URLs containing git config values. This allows an attacker to set arbitrary git config settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper handling of user-supplied URLs during git clone operations.",
    "Injection of arbitrary git config settings via a crafted URL.",
     "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the ability to control the `http.proxy` setting."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can set the `http.<url>.proxy` git config, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This could potentially allow the attacker to access internal resources or services.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Crafted import URLs provided during project creation or mirror configuration."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create projects or mirrors and specify the import URL, which is typically available to authenticated users."
