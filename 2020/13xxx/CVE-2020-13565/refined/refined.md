The content is related to CVE-2020-13565.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `return_page` function in `gacl_admin_api.class.php` (or `Gacl/GaclAdminApi.php` in OpenEMR) uses the `$url` parameter in a Location header without sanitization, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an open redirect due to lack of input sanitization of the `url` parameter. The `return_page` function also lacks `exit()` or `die()` call after setting the `Location` header.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to arbitrary URLs, potentially leading to phishing attacks and credential theft. The lack of exit call after redirect could cause unexpected behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious URL in the `return_page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `return_page` parameter that is accessed by a victim. No special privileges or position is needed.
