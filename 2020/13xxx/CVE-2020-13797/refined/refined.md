The provided content is a commit diff from the Navigate-CMS repository on GitHub, specifically addressing a fix for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The commit message states: "HTML Purify some fields to prevent XSS attacks".

Here's a breakdown of the changes relevant to the CVE:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application was not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before rendering it in HTML. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into fields, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the lack of input sanitization in various fields and paths within `feed.class.php`, `menu.class.php`, `menus.php`, `structure.class.php` and `website.class.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
  - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
  - Steal session cookies, potentially hijacking user accounts.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Deface the website.
  - Perform other malicious activities, depending on the access and permissions of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through user input fields such as:
    -  `$fields` in `feed.class.php`
    -  `paths` in `feed.class.php`
    -  `functions` in `menu.class.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to input data into the vulnerable fields. This may require:
    - The attacker to have an account or access level to input data.
    - The attacker to be able to manipulate input data, depending on the application.

**Fix:**
- The commit introduces HTML Purifier using the `$purifier->purify()` function to sanitize user inputs before they are used to construct HTML. This prevents the execution of malicious script code. The changes include the implementation of the purifier in the following files and their respective functions:
  - `lib/packages/feeds/feed.class.php` (`load_from_post`)
  - `lib/packages/menus/menu.class.php` (`load_from_post`)
  - `lib/packages/menus/menus.php` (`load_from_post`)
  - `lib/packages/structure/structure.class.php` (`load_from_post`)
  - `lib/packages/websites/website.class.php` (`load_from_post`)

**Additional Notes:**
- The diff shows changes where a new line containing `$this->dictionary[substr($key, strlen($field.'-'))][$field] = $purifier->purify($value);` was added.

This commit provides a patch that is relevant to CVE-2020-13797, addressing the XSS vulnerabilities.
