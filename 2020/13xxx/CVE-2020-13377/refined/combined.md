# Path traversal in Enterprise loadbalancer VA MAX - v8.3.8 and earlier

21 Apr 2020  » [cve](/category/cve)

Vulnerability: Path traversal (also known as directory traversal or file path injection)

Path traversal in Enterprise loadbalancer VA MAX Appliance v8.3.8-134

Vendor: Loadbalancer.org, https://www.loadbalancer.org

Product: ENTERPRISE VA MAX

Version affected: Loadbalancer.org Appliance v8.3.8 as the latest in October 2019

” as per statement on https://www.linkedin.com/company/loadbalancer-org website.

* CVE ID: CVE-2020-13377* CWE ID: CWE-35

#### Vulnerability description:

Path traversal (also known as directory traversal or file path injection) is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories on a web server that are outside of the web root directory. This vulnerability occurs when a web application does not properly sanitize user input that is used to construct a file path.

The evidence of a path traversal attack could include a log entry that shows an attempt to access a file or directory that is outside the expected range of directories. For example, if the web application is designed to serve files from the directory /var/www/html/, an attacker might try to access the file /etc/passwd by providing input such as ../../../../../etc/passwd.

Other evidence of a path traversal attack could include unusual file access patterns or unexpected file system activity, which could be detected through file system monitoring tools or intrusion detection systems. Additionally, if an attacker is able to successfully exploit a path traversal vulnerability, they may be able to exfiltrate sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the web server. In such cases, the evidence of the attack may include changes to system files or the creation of new files or directories.
##### Proof of Concept

A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted HTTP request. This is exploitable by an authenticated attacker who submits a modified GET request.

Sample GET request to ‘etc/shadow’ file, which allowed an attacker to access files and directories on a web server that are outside of the web root directory. This vulnerability occurs when a web application does not properly sanitize user input that is used to construct a file path.

Identified vulnerable parameters: waf\_filename
