Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the Loadbalancer.org Enterprise VA MAX appliance. The web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the web root by manipulating the `waf_filename` parameter in HTTP GET requests. This is also known as directory traversal or file path injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, like `/etc/shadow`, which contains hashed user passwords, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, the ability to read arbitrary files can sometimes be leveraged for more serious exploits, such as code injection or modification, depending on the files accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP GET requests. The attacker modifies the `waf_filename` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (`../`).
- **Authenticated Attacker:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the admin interface of the Loadbalancer.org appliance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Loadbalancer.org appliance's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials for the administrative interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `waf_filename` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `waf_filename` within the `/lbadmin/ajax/js_dispatcher.php` script.
- The attacker sends a GET request to `/lbadmin/ajax/js_dispatcher.php` with `option=waf_log`, `waf_filename=..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fshadow`, and `log_option=base`.
- The server responds with the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file.

The provided information confirms that this is a path traversal vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to read arbitrary files. The content provides more detail than the description found in most CVE records.
