  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-13847",
    "description": "Sylabs Singularity 3.0 through 3.5 lacks support for an Integrity Check. Singularity's sign and verify commands do not sign metadata found in the global header or data object descriptors of a SIF file.",
    "affected_versions": "3.0 through 3.5",
    "fixed_versions": "3.6.0",
    "root_cause": "The sign and verify commands do not sign metadata found in the global header or data object descriptors of a SIF file.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of Integrity Check for metadata in SIF files",
        "Unsigned metadata allows modification without detection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify metadata within a signed SIF container, causing unexpected or malicious behavior, while the container still verifies successfully. This includes, but not limited to: modifying partition types, altering the global hash-bang header, re-labeling object data types, modifying filesystem types, modifying UID/GID, modifying creation time and name of data objects, modifying image UUID",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to modify the SIF container file, no special privileges required on target system"
  }
