# Release of Cacti 1.2.11

Thank you everyone who are using Cacti and especially those helping to make Cacti better! This release includes a few new features as an attempt to make forward progress on our roadmap, without introducing new bugs. So, the features introduced were those that had a lower risk of introducing undesirable behavior.

The team now hopes to focus more on our next major release while at the same time recognizing that additional issues exist that remain to be solved, and that new issues are likely to continue to be identified by the Cacti community. We will address those in the 1.2.x branch as before, but releases from the 1.2.x branch should decrease.

For additional details check out the [README](https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/develop/README.md) located on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cacti/).

**IMPORTANT:** This release addresses a few minor security issues that should be noted. See the changelog below for details.

## Description

![@sh0lt0](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22929138?v=4&size=48)[sh0lt0](https://github.com/sh0lt0)opened [on Mar 11, 2020](https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/issues/3343#issue-579312165)

**Describe the bug**

Cacti admin console provides a functionality to disable a created user which takes his privileges to perform any action but if a page is auto-refreshed a disabled user can view updated data.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Log in with Admin account and navigate to <http://192.168.56.106/cacti/user_admin.php?action=user_edit&id=5&tab=realms>
2. Give the new user permission to view logs.
3. Login to new user's account and navigate <http://192.168.56.106/cacti/clog_user.php>
4. From Admin's account disable the created user.

**Actual behavior**

A disabled user can view the system logs and the logs are even updating after the refresh time.

**Expected behavior**

A disabled user should not be privileged to view the system logs.

* OS: Ubuntu
* Browser: Firefox
* Version - Cacti 1.2.8

Package        : cacti
Version        : 0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-10060 CVE-2018-10061 CVE-2019-11025 CVE-2020-7106
                 CVE-2020-13230 CVE-2020-23226 CVE-2021-23225 CVE-2022-0730
Debian Bug     : 926700 949996

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Cacti, a web interface for
graphing of monitoring systems, leading to authentication bypass and
cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker may get access to unauthorized
areas and impersonate other users, under certain conditions.

CVE-2018-10060

    Cacti has XSS because it does not properly reject unintended
    characters, related to use of the sanitize_uri function in
    lib/functions.php.

CVE-2018-10061

    Cacti has XSS because it makes certain htmlspecialchars calls
    without the ENT_QUOTES flag (these calls occur when the
    html_escape function in lib/html.php is not used).

CVE-2019-11025

    No escaping occurs before printing out the value of the SNMP
    community string (SNMP Options) in the View poller cache, leading
    to XSS.

CVE-2020-7106

    Cacti has stored XSS in multiple files as demonstrated by the
    description parameter in data_sources.php (a raw string from the
    database that is displayed by $header to trigger the XSS).

CVE-2020-13230

    Disabling a user account does not immediately invalidate any
    permissions granted to that account (e.g., permission to view
    logs).

CVE-2020-23226

    Multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in
    multiple files.

CVE-2021-23225

    Cacti allows authenticated users with User Management permissions
    to inject arbitrary web script or HTML in the "new_username" field
    during creation of a new user via "Copy" method at user_admin.php.

CVE-2022-0730

    Under certain ldap conditions, Cacti authentication can be
    bypassed with certain credential types.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.

For the detailed security status of cacti please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cacti>
