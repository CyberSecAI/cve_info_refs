Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper access control mechanism in Cacti. When a user account is disabled, the system does not immediately invalidate the permissions that were previously granted to that account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to revoke active sessions and permissions when a user is disabled.
- **Session Management Issues:** The system does not immediately invalidate existing sessions of a disabled user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A disabled user can potentially continue to access and view data (e.g., system logs) even after their account is disabled.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information that the user was previously authorized to access may still be viewable.
- **Privilege Escalation (limited):** Although not a full privilege escalation, a disabled user retains the privileges associated with their previous active session and can act with those limited privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the Cacti web interface. An attacker with a user account on the system can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Cacti User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account that can be disabled by an administrator.
- **Session Prior to Disablement:** The attacker must have an active session with the Cacti system prior to their account being disabled.
- **Knowledge of Auto-Refresh:** The attacker must be aware that pages with auto-refresh can continue to pull data even after account disablement.
- **No Need for Admin Privileges:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability as a disabled user, without requiring admin rights, after initial set up and disablement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub issue (#3343) describes a scenario where a disabled user can still view system logs due to the lack of immediate permission invalidation.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Cacti version 1.2.11.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Fedora by updating to cacti-1.2.12.
- Debian LTS also addressed this vulnerability in their security update DLA-2965-1.
