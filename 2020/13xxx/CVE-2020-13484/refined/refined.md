  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient checks when processing URLs in the `services/main/ajax.php?action=attachUrlPreview` endpoint. The application fetches and parses the content of the provided URL. A second server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability is triggered when parsing the content of a fetched HTML document, specifically the `og:image` meta tag, which is not properly checked for local/intranet IPs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Insufficient Input Validation",
      "Bypass of Local IP Restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can force the Bitrix server to make requests to internal services, potentially revealing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions. The vulnerability allows bypassing intended restrictions on access to local IP addresses, making internal infrastructure accessible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker sends a POST request to the `services/main/ajax.php?action=attachUrlPreview` endpoint with a crafted URL.",
      "The crafted URL points to an attacker-controlled server hosting an HTML document with a `og:image` meta tag pointing to an internal IP address."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to access the website, a valid unauthenticated session, and a CSRF token. These requirements can be easily met without needing special privileges."
