The provided content describes three SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpGACL, specifically CVE-2020-13566, CVE-2020-13567, and CVE-2020-13568. Only CVE-2020-13567 is relevant to this query.

**CVE-2020-13567 - phpGACL database parent_id SQL injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `parent_id` parameter within the `admin/edit_group.php` script when the 'Submit' action is triggered. This unsanitized input is then used in SQL queries within the `add_group` and `edit_group` functions, leading to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-89).
    *   Specifically, the `parent_id` parameter is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
    *   Vulnerable code paths are in `admin/edit_group.php`, `add_group` function, and `edit_group` function.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting database records).
    *   Complete database compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to `admin/edit_group.php` with `action=Submit` and a malicious `parent_id` value.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when the application uses the unsanitized `parent_id` in SQL queries.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   The attacker likely needs to have an authenticated session (as indicated by the cookie usage in the provided exploit proof-of-concept).
