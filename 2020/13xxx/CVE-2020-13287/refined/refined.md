Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2020-13287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in GitLab's permission model, specifically regarding the visibility of confidential epics attached to confidential issues. Project reporters (and users with higher roles) could see the titles of confidential epics even if they did not have direct access at the group level where the epic was created. This is because the confidential issue was visible at the project level, and the system was not correctly restricting the display of the attached confidential epic's title.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is a failure to properly enforce access controls for confidential epics. The system did not check if a user had group-level access before displaying the epic's title on a confidential issue viewable at the project level.
- **Information Disclosure:** This leads to an information disclosure vulnerability because the titles of confidential epics, intended to be restricted to a specific group, were exposed to project members who shouldn't have had access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is the disclosure of confidential information. Users with reporter access at the project level could see confidential epic titles, potentially revealing sensitive strategic or planning details intended only for group-level users.
- **Potential for Further Abuse:** While not explicitly mentioned, the disclosed information could be used for further malicious activities depending on the sensitivity and context of the information contained in the Epic titles.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access of Confidential Issue:** An attacker needs to have reporter (or higher) access to a project and then directly view a confidential issue that has a confidential epic attached to it.
- **No Direct Interaction with Group Level:** The attacker does not need any direct access to the group where the confidential epic was created.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Project-Level Access:** An attacker must have at least reporter access to a GitLab project where a confidential issue is created and linked to a confidential epic.
- **Knowledge of the Confidential Issue:** They also need knowledge of a specific confidential issue that has the confidential epic attached to it in order to trigger the vulnerability by viewing the issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was reported on HackerOne with report ID #919468.
- The vulnerability was confirmed on GitLab.com version `13.2.0-pre 2ebd325ab13`.
- The reported fix for this issue would involve checking the user's access level at the group level before showing the epic title on the confidential issue's page.
