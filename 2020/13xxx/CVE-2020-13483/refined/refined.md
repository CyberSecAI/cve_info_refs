Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13483

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `mobileapp.list` component's `ajax.php` handler. Specifically, the `items[ITEMS][ID]` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to neutralize or encode user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript/HTML code into the web page.
- **Bitrix WAF Bypass:** The vulnerability description explicitly states that the XSS is achieved through a bypass of the Bitrix Web Application Firewall (WAF).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **JavaScript/HTML Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code or HTML content into the user's browser when accessing the vulnerable page.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** With injected JavaScript code, the attacker can perform a wide range of actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user, manipulating website content, performing actions on behalf of the user, or potentially gaining access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `components/bitrix/mobileapp.list/ajax.php/` URI.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The malicious payload is inserted via the `items[ITEMS][ID]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Website:** The attacker only needs access to the affected website. There are no additional requirements like authenticated access or special user privileges required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Payload Example:**
```
<img src="//
);
//"><div x
});var BX = window.BX;window.BX = function(node, bCache){};BX.ready = function(handler){};function __MobileAppList(test){alert(document.location);};//</div>
```

**URL Example:**
```

```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Bitrix24 versions up to 20.0.0.
- The issue was reported and fixed in a later patch, but the specific patch version isn't stated.
- The provided information includes a specific IP address in the URL example (`http://192.168.1.30...`) indicating it was likely tested in a local environment.
- Some users in the comments confirm the vulnerability is reproducible but some encounter issues like getting a "Forbidden" response, possibly related to site-specific configurations or WAF rules that might have been updated after the initial discovery of this XSS.
- The comments also mention cases where the response `MAPP_ML_MOBILEAPP_NOT_INSTALLED` was received, which might mean the `mobileapp.list` component was not installed or active, preventing the exploitation.
