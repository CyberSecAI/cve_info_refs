{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The router's web server (httpd) has a buffer overflow vulnerability. When processing the `speed_dir` parameter from a POST request, the value is used in a `sprintf` call to a local stack variable. This overwrites the function's return address.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. The provided PoC can result in a denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetSpeedWan` endpoint with an overly long `speed_dir` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web server. This typically implies network access to the device."
