  "CVE-2020-13320": {
    "description": "User with guest permissions can't view security dashboard of the private project. However, this is not applied when user permission changes from maintainer to guest. As a result, if user was previously a maintainer in the project he/she can add the project to their security dashboard and when their access levels decreases to guest, they can still view new security vulnerabilities result found in the project through their security dashboard. New security issues found in the project are reflecting back to the guest user security dashboard.",
    "root_cause": "The application fails to remove projects from a user's security dashboard when their permissions are reduced from maintainer to guest.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unauthorized access to private project security dashboard"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user can exploit the security issues found, disclose newly added files, dependencies, and the internal structure of the project/application to the unauthorized user.",
    "attack_vectors": "A user who was previously a maintainer adds a project to their security dashboard. When their permissions are reduced to guest, they can still view the project's security dashboard through their own dashboard.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have previously been a maintainer of the private project and have added the project to their security dashboard. Their access level then needs to be reduced to guest."
