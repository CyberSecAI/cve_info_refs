Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of this vulnerability is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically SQL injection. The `CHaD.asmx` web service of AVEVA Enterprise Data Management Web fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `InstanceName`, `InstancePath`, and `ClassName` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through three parameters (`InstanceName`, `InstancePath`, and `ClassName`) in the `CHaD.asmx` web service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the affected database, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information, including:
    - Usernames and password hashes
    - Other data stored in the database
    - The attacker may also be able to modify or delete data or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted SOAP web requests to the `CHaD.asmx` endpoint.
- **SOAP Request Modification:** The attacker modifies the SOAP request to inject SQL code into the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system to send the malicious SOAP requests.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without requiring prior authentication to the application.
- **Low Skill Level:** The CISA advisory notes that the vulnerability is of "low skill level to exploit".

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in AVEVA Enterprise Data Management Web (formerly eDNA Web) versions 2019 and prior.
- Specifically, the Talos report indicates the vulnerability was found in eDNA Enterprise Data Historian 3.0.1.2/7.5.4989.33053.
- The Talos report provides specific SOAP request examples demonstrating the injection points for each of the three vulnerable parameters: `InstancePath` (CVE-2020-13499), `ClassName` (CVE-2020-13500), and `InstanceName` (CVE-2020-13501).
-  CVSS v3 scores are provided:
    - 9.6 for versions prior to 2017 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    - 9.0 for versions 2017-2019 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
   - Talos reports a score of 9.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) for the same vulnerability, indicating that exploitation over the network is possible.
- The vendor recommends upgrading to AVEVA Enterprise Data Management Web v2019 SP1 or contacting support for a hotfix (v2018 SP2).
