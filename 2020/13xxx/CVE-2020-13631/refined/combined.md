FreeBSD-SA-20:22.sqlite Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities in sqlite3
Category: contrib
Module: sqlite3
Announced: 2020-08-05
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2020-06-15 03:10:53 UTC (stable/12, 12.1-STABLE)
2020-08-05 17:13:08 UTC (releng/12.1, 12.1-RELEASE-p8)
2020-06-15 03:10:53 UTC (stable/11, 11.4-STABLE)
2020-08-05 17:13:08 UTC (releng/11.4, 11.4-RELEASE-p2)
2020-08-05 17:13:08 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p12)
CVE Name: CVE-2020-11655, CVE-2020-11656, CVE-2020-13434,
CVE-2020-13435, CVE-2020-13630, CVE-2020-13631,
CVE-2020-13632
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
SQLite is an SQL database engine in a C library. Programs that link the
SQLite library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS
process. The distribution comes with a standalone command-line access
program (sqlite3) that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which
serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.
FreeBSD includes SQLite as a private library for base system usage that is
not generally exposed for third party packages to use.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been published including improper input
validation (CVE-2020-11655), use after free (CVE-2020-11656, CVE-2020-13630),
integer overflow (CVE-2020-13434), null pointer dereference (CVE-2020-13435,
CVE-2020-13632), and namespace collision (CVE-2020-13631).
III. Impact
Malicious SQL statements could crash, hijack processes, or cause data
corruption.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available. The FreeBSD security team is not aware of any
base system components that use SQLite in such a way as to expose these
vulnerabilities to untrusted or remote users, but is updating SQLite out of
an abundance of caution.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 12.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:22/sqlite.12.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:22/sqlite.12.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sqlite.12.1.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 11.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:22/sqlite.11.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:22/sqlite.11.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sqlite.11.4.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 11.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:22/sqlite.11.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:22/sqlite.11.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sqlite.11.3.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/12/ r362190
releng/12.1/ r363922
stable/11/ r362190
releng/11.4/ r363922
releng/11.3/ r363922
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simpliÔ¨Åes installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiÔ¨Åcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.Ô¨Årst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciÔ¨Åc to the customer‚Äôs
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deÔ¨Åned by the customer to accomplish Ô¨Ånal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-1971

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those
name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function
behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses
the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certiÔ¨Åcate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via
the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control
both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
trick a client or server into checking a malicious certiÔ¨Åcate against a malicious CRL then this may occur.
Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certiÔ¨Åcate.
This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certiÔ¨Åcate and CRL being veriÔ¨Åed. OpenSSL‚Äôs
s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the ‚Äú-crl_download‚Äù option which implements
automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note
that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct
encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that
OpenSSL‚Äôs parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

Vulnerability CVE-2020-8625

BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are conÔ¨Ågured to use GSS-
TSIG features. In a conÔ¨Åguration which uses BIND‚Äôs default settings the vulnerable code path is
not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-
gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconÔ¨Åguration options. Although the default conÔ¨Åguration is not
vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well
as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named
process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3450

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT Ô¨Çag enables additional security checks of the certiÔ¨Åcates present
in a certiÔ¨Åcate chain.
It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to
disallow certiÔ¨Åcates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to conÔ¨Årm that certiÔ¨Åcates in the chain are valid CA certiÔ¨Åcates was overwritten. This
effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certiÔ¨Åcates must not be able to issue other certiÔ¨Åcates. If a
‚Äúpurpose‚Äù has been conÔ¨Ågured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certiÔ¨Åcate is
a valid CA. All of the named ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore,
where a purpose is set the certiÔ¨Åcate chain will still be rejected even when the strict Ô¨Çag has been
used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certiÔ¨Åcate veriÔ¨Åcation routines, but it can
be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly
set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT veriÔ¨Åcation Ô¨Çag and either not set a purpose for the certiÔ¨Åcate
veriÔ¨Åcation or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The Ô¨Årst time, on en-
try, the ‚Äúout‚Äù parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the ‚Äúoutlen‚Äù parameter is populated with the buffer
size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufÔ¨Åciently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the ‚Äúout‚Äù
parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of
the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the Ô¨Årst call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overÔ¨Çow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A
malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause
attacker chosen data to overÔ¨Çow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of
other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application
to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3712

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which
contains a buffer holding the string data and a Ô¨Åeld holding the buffer length. This contrasts with
normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
(0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL‚Äôs own ‚Äúd2i‚Äù
functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the
ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures
which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the ‚Äúdata‚Äù and ‚Äúlength‚Äù Ô¨Åelds in the
ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been
directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
without NUL terminating the ‚Äúdata‚Äù Ô¨Åeld, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can
also occur during name constraints processing of certiÔ¨Åcates (for example if a certiÔ¨Åcate has been
directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and
the certiÔ¨Åcate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).
It can also occur in the
X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of
the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing
a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such
as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22883

Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when
too many connection attempts with an ‚ÄòunknownProtocol‚Äô are established. This leads to a leak of Ô¨Åle
descriptors. If a Ô¨Åle descriptor limit is conÔ¨Ågured on the system, then the server is unable to accept
new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a Ô¨Åle. If no Ô¨Åle descriptor limit is
conÔ¨Ågured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22884

Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as the
whitelist includes ‚Äúlocalhost6‚Äù. When ‚Äúlocalhost6‚Äù is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary
domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim‚Äôs DNS server
or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the ‚Äúlocalhost6‚Äù
domain. As long as the attacker uses the ‚Äúlocalhost6‚Äù domain, they can still apply the attack described
in CVE-2018-7160.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22890

curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows a malicious HTTPS proxy to MITM
a connection due to bad handling of TLS 1.3 session tickets. When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3,
libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the
remote server and then wrongly ‚Äúshort-cut‚Äù the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS
proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent
the server TLS certiÔ¨Åcate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note
that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certiÔ¨Åcate that curl will accept for the MITMed
server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certiÔ¨Åcate check.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22901

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory
being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use
this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When
libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it
stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If
the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that Ô¨Årst transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on
that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct
place in memory.

settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential conÔ¨Åguration options. Although
the default conÔ¨Åguration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND
is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with
Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this Ô¨Çaw can be used to trigger a buffer
over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this Ô¨Çaw can
be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overÔ¨Çow and possibly also to achieve remote code
execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it
had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable
ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO
implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

The npm package ‚Äútar‚Äù (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary
File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufÔ¨Åcient symlink protection. node-tar aims to guarantee
that any Ô¨Åle whose location would be modiÔ¨Åed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part,
achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent
unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when
directories are created. This logic was insufÔ¨Åcient when extracting tar Ô¨Åles that contained both a
directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the
directory being created and added to the node-tar directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where
node-tar checks for symlinks occur. By Ô¨Årst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially
allowing an untrusted tar Ô¨Åle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
Ô¨Åles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary Ô¨Åle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in

repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. ///home/user/.bashrc) would still resolve to an absolute
path, thus allowing arbitrary Ô¨Åle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a
custom onentry method which sanitizes the entry.path or a filter method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which
Ô¨Åxes a similar bug in later versions of tar.

Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted
Directory (‚ÄòPath Traversal‚Äô)

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37701

The npm package ‚Äútar‚Äù (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary Ô¨Åle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any Ô¨Åle
whose location would be modiÔ¨Åed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufÔ¨Åcient when extracting tar Ô¨Åles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
\ and / characters as path separators, however \ is a valid Ô¨Ålename character on posix systems.
By Ô¨Årst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar Ô¨Åle to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary Ô¨Åles into that location, thus allowing
arbitrary Ô¨Åle creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
Ô¨Ålesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at FOO, followed by a symbolic link named foo, then
on case-insensitive Ô¨Åle systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from
the Ô¨Ålesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.
A subsequent Ô¨Åle entry within the FOO directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic
link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases
4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches
for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version
of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37712

The npm package ‚Äútar‚Äù (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary Ô¨Åle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any Ô¨Åle
whose location would be modiÔ¨Åed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufÔ¨Åcient when extracting tar Ô¨Åles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on
Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same Ô¨Åle system entities as their 8.3 ‚Äúshort
path‚Äù counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the
path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same Ô¨Åle system entity,
followed by a Ô¨Åle using the Ô¨Årst form. By Ô¨Årst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the Ô¨Ålesystem, it
was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted
tar Ô¨Åle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary Ô¨Åles into that location,
thus allowing arbitrary Ô¨Åle creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18,
5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for
these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of
node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37713

The npm package ‚Äútar‚Äù (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary Ô¨Åle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any Ô¨Åle
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part,
accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain .. path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This
logic was insufÔ¨Åcient on Windows systems when extracting tar Ô¨Åles that contained a path that was not
an absolute path, but speciÔ¨Åed a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as C:some\path.
If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example D:\extraction\dir, then the result
of path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath) would resolve against the current working
directory on the C: drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a .. portion of the
path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as C:../foo, and was not properly sanitized
by the logic that checked for .. within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects
users of node-tar on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.
There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions
of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39134

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency con-
tracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected
folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency speciÔ¨Åers deÔ¨Åned in package.json man-
ifests for dependencies with a speciÔ¨Åc name, and nesting folders to resolve conÔ¨Çicting dependencies.
When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist‚Äôs internal data structure saw
them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the node_modules hierarchy. How-
ever, on case-insensitive Ô¨Åle systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined
with a symlink dependency such as file:/some/path, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in
which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the Ô¨Ålesystem. For example, a package
pwn-a could deÔ¨Åne a dependency in their package.json Ô¨Åle such as "foo": "file:/some/path". An-
other package, pwn-b could deÔ¨Åne a dependency such as FOO: "file:foo.tgz". On case-insensitive
Ô¨Åle systems, if pwn-a was installed, and then pwn-b was installed afterwards, the contents of foo.tgz
would be written to /some/path, and any existing contents of /some/path would be removed. Anyone
using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive Ô¨Ålesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39135

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the
expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project‚Äôs node_modules
folder. If the node_modules folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced
with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on
the Ô¨Åle system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are Ô¨Åltered out, so
another means of creating a node_modules symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A preinstall
script could replace node_modules with a symlink. (This is prevented by using --ignore-scripts.)
2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run npm install
--ignore-scripts in the root. This may be successful, because npm install --ignore-scripts is
typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.
This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more
information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : sqlite
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 3.32.1
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <http://www.sqlite.org/>
Summary : Library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine
Description :
SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and
flexibility of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of
supporting a separate database server. Version 2 and version 3 binaries
are named to permit each to be installed on a single host
