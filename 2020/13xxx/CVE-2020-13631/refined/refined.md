Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-13631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a logic error in SQLite's handling of virtual table names during the renaming process. Specifically, it allows a virtual table to be renamed to the name of one of its shadow tables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation when renaming virtual tables.
- Lack of a check to prevent renaming a virtual table to a name that is already in use by one of its shadow tables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption**: A maliciously crafted SQL query might lead to data corruption.
- **Denial of Service**: An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by exploiting this issue, which may lead to an application crash or otherwise impede operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to be able to execute SQL queries that include the renaming of virtual tables. This likely involves local access to an application using the SQLite database or remote access if the database is exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute SQL commands on the vulnerable SQLite database.
- The attacker needs the knowledge of how virtual tables and their shadow tables are named to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker could be a local or remote user depending on the context of the application using the vulnerable SQLite library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved adding a check to prevent a virtual table from being renamed to one of its shadow tables.
- This vulnerability affects various platforms, including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, Windows, and Linux distributions like Fedora and Ubuntu.

The information from the various sources, especially the Apple security updates and the Red Hat bugzilla entries, clearly indicate the vulnerability's nature and its remediation. The fix implemented involves checking if the target name is already in use by a shadow table. The Ubuntu notice indicates that the issue is a potential denial of service. The SQLite commit message also confirms the fix.
