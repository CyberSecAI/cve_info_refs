Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13566:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries. Specifically, the `group_id` parameter within the `del_group` function is directly concatenated into a SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the `admin/edit_group.php` script within the `del_group` function where the `delete_group` parameter (mapped to `group_id`) is used without sanitization within the SQL query.
- Unsanitized parameters: Specifically, `delete_group` POST parameter is not sanitized when used in SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary SQL injection.
- An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or perform other malicious actions allowed by the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP requests, specifically through POST requests.
- The vulnerable code is located in `admin/edit_group.php`.
- The attacker can manipulate the `delete_group` parameter when the `action` parameter is set to "Delete" to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker would likely need to have some knowledge of the application's structure to craft effective SQL injection payloads.
- According to the CVSS score, a low privileged user is required to perform the attack.
