The provided content is a documentation page for the `pandas.read_pickle` function. It contains a warning about the potential dangers of loading pickled data from untrusted sources. This is related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13091, which involves arbitrary code execution via a malicious pickle file.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pandas.read_pickle` function uses Python's `pickle` module to deserialize data. The `pickle` module is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if the pickle data is crafted maliciously.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The weakness is the use of Python's `pickle` module which allows for arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by crafting a malicious pickle file and tricking the victim into loading it via `pandas.read_pickle`.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a maliciously crafted pickle file, which can be delivered in various ways (e.g., through email attachments, malicious websites, or other means of file transfer).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious pickle file and the victim needs to execute `pandas.read_pickle` on the malicious file.

The warning on the page clearly states: "Loading pickled data received from untrusted sources can be unsafe. See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)." This directly reflects the vulnerability associated with `pickle` and is relevant to CVE-2020-13091.
