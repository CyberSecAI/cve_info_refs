Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the `/api/users/search` endpoint in Harbor. This endpoint was intended to be restricted to administrators but could be accessed by non-administrator users due to a bypass in the search functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User Enumeration:** The primary vulnerability is user enumeration. By sending a GET request to the `/api/users/search` endpoint with the `username` parameter set to `_`, an authenticated user could retrieve a list of all users, including their user IDs and usernames, which often included email addresses. This was unintended and a bypass of access controls.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The vulnerability was further exacerbated by the use of the underscore character (`_`) as a wildcard in the `username` search parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could obtain a list of usernames and user IDs, potentially including email addresses.
- **Social Engineering Attacks:** The disclosed user information, especially email addresses, could be used as targets for social engineering attacks such as phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests to the `/api/users/search` endpoint of the Harbor instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** An attacker needs to have a valid, non-administrator account on the Harbor instance.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Harbor server.
