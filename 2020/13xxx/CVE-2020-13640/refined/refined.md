Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13640

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress Plugin wpDiscuz versions 5.3.5 and earlier

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the `order` parameter within the `wpdLoadMoreComments` AJAX endpoint. The plugin directly uses unsanitized user input from the `$_POST['order']` parameter in the `loadMoreComments()` function (class.WpdiscuzCore.php) which is then passed to the database query via the WordPress `comments_clauses` hook without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection. The injected SQL code is placed within the `ORDER BY` clause of a database query that retrieves comments. Due to the blind nature, the attacker does not receive direct error messages but can infer the success or failure of the injected SQL through whether the comment list in the response is empty or not.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize the user-supplied `order` parameter before using it in the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database, such as user credentials, plugin data, database names, table names, and other confidential information.
- **Potential Data Modification:** Although not explicitly detailed, SQL injection vulnerabilities could potentially be used to modify or delete data.
- **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** Exploiting the vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and potentially manipulate website data, leading to breaches in confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **`order` Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `order` parameter.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker utilizes the server's response to determine the success or failure of the injected SQL query using the presence or absence of the comment list.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, making it easily accessible to any attacker with network access.
- **Knowledge of Target Site:** The attacker needs the target website's URL and the plugin is installed
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests with the malicious `order` parameter.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker should be knowledgeable about SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
- **At least one Comment on a Post:**  To exploit, there must be at least one comment for a post in the database so that the injected query can be tested if it was successful or not.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in wpDiscuz versions 5.3.5 and earlier.
- It was fixed in version 5.3.6 for the 5.x branch and was also resolved in the 7.x version of the plugin.
- The provided exploit.py PoC demonstrates how to extract data from the database, including user credentials, and names of non-builtin DB tables.

In summary, this is a critical vulnerability due to its ease of exploitation, the ability to perform unauthenticated information disclosure, and the potential for other malicious actions by exploiting this SQL Injection vulnerability.
