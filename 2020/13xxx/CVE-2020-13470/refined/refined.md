Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13470:

**Verification:**

The document explicitly mentions `CVE-2020-13470` in Table 4, linking it to the `GD32F130` device and the `H1: Invasive Data Eavesdropping` and `H2: Invasive RDP Manipulation` vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the hardware design of the GD32F130 microcontroller, specifically the use of a dual-die system where the logic and flash memory are on separate dies connected by bonding wires. This exposes the inter-die communication (QSPI bus) to physical eavesdropping and manipulation. Additionally, the way the RDP setting is loaded in the system's startup sequence and the presence of the RDP level 0 value in the factory configuration enables a manipulation attack on the option bytes address, causing the system to fall back to RDP level 0, and allowing debug access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **H1: Invasive Data Eavesdropping:** The QSPI bus between the logic and flash memory dies is accessible through the bonding wires. Data transmitted on this bus, including the firmware, can be eavesdropped using a logic analyzer after decapping the device and connecting to the bond wires. Additionally, the data on the bus is obfuscated via word and bit permutation, but this obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.
*   **H2: Invasive RDP Manipulation:** The RDP setting is loaded during startup and is present on the QSPI bus in plain text.  By manipulating the address of the QSPI transaction that loads the option bytes, the device can be forced to load the RDP level 0 value from the factory configuration area instead, effectively downgrading the security level to RDP level 0 and enabling full debug access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to the complete compromise of the GD32F130 microcontroller. An attacker can extract the entire firmware, thereby gaining access to sensitive data and intellectual property. The attacker can also bypass the security mechanisms implemented by the RDP setting, allowing for arbitrary manipulation of the device's operation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **H1: Invasive Data Eavesdropping:** The attacker must physically access the bonding wires of the GD32F130 microcontroller by carefully removing the casing using sandpaper and acid. Then, they need to make contact with the bonding wires (using thin wires or conductive silver paint) and attach a logic analyzer to eavesdrop on the QSPI communication. They will also need to reverse engineer the word and bit permutations.
*   **H2: Invasive RDP Manipulation:** The attacker must gain access to a single bonding wire of the QSPI bus (specifically IO2). They then must use an external attack board to monitor the signal and inject a fault in the address phase of the option byte loading, redirecting it to the factory configuration. This downgrades the RDP level and enables full debug access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **H1: Invasive Data Eavesdropping:** Requires physical access to the device, knowledge of decapping techniques, ability to connect to bonding wires, use of a logic analyzer, and understanding of the QSPI protocol to reverse-engineer the data.
*  **H2: Invasive RDP Manipulation:** Requires physical access to the device, knowledge of decapping techniques, ability to connect to one of the QSPI bond wires (specifically IO2), use of an external attack board with precise timing capabilities, and knowledge of the QSPI protocol.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document provides a detailed explanation of how the obfuscation is performed and how it can be reverse-engineered, with a mathematical representation of the address and bit permutation.
*   The attacks are considered low-cost DIY attacks, achievable without sophisticated lab equipment, making them a significant threat.
*   The document includes a coordinated disclosure section indicating that the manufacturers were informed of the vulnerabilities prior to publication.
*   The document references supplementary material, which is online.
