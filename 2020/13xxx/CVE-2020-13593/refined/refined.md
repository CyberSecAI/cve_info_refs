  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2020-13593",
    "description": "The provided content mentions a fix for a pairing process issue in Texas Instruments' BLE-Stack 1.5.2 SDK. It states: 'Fixed an issue with the pairing process. An initiator will now reject a confirmation value identical to its local confirm value (BLESTACK-5453).'",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the pairing process within the Texas Instruments BLE-Stack 1.5.2 SDK, specifically the lack of validation of confirmation values during pairing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of confirmation values during the pairing process."
    ],
     "impact": "The vulnerability allows a malicious initiator to potentially bypass the pairing process by sending a confirmation value identical to the local confirm value, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources or data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the Bluetooth Low Energy pairing process, specifically during the confirmation phase.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to act as a BLE initiator and have the capability to perform the pairing process and send the malicious confirmation value.",
    "additional_details": "The fix, according to the release notes, has been implemented in BLE-Stack 1.5.2 to reject confirmation values that are identical to the local confirm value. This means that the vulnerability was present in prior versions of the stack. The advisory references 'BLESTACK-5453' as a tracking identifier for this issue within TI's systems."
