- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application improperly handles user-supplied input when constructing file paths, leading to a local file inclusion vulnerability. Specifically, the `fileName` parameter in the HTTP request is vulnerable to path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  - Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure of sensitive data such as configuration files, credentials (e.g. Postgresql password), and other system files.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through an authenticated HTTP request, specifically by crafting a GET request to the `/WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/dashboardTree` endpoint and including path traversal sequences (e.g., `..%5c`) in the `fileName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to send the malicious HTTP requests.
