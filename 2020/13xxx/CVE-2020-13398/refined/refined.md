  "CVE-2020-13398": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in FreeRDP before 2.1.1. An out-of-bounds (OOB) write vulnerability has been detected in crypto_rsa_common in libfreerdp/crypto/crypto.c.",
    "Root cause": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the crypto_rsa_common function due to improper handling of buffer sizes during RSA cryptographic operations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Write"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash (denial of service) or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the client system.",
    "Attack vector": "The attack vector is network-based, specifically through a malicious RDP server sending crafted data to the vulnerable client.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or impersonate a RDP server and be able to send specifically crafted RDP data to the client.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is located in libfreerdp/crypto/crypto.c. The fix involves correctly handling the buffer sizes to prevent writing beyond allocated memory boundaries."
