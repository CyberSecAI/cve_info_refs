Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of array bounds checking in the Hobbes programming language interpreter. This allows a user to write to arbitrary memory locations by providing an out-of-bounds index when accessing an array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds (OOB) read/write vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read and write to memory locations outside the allocated bounds of an array.
- **Lack of input validation:** The interpreter doesn't validate array indices, leading to memory corruption issues when using out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to achieve local code execution.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely using the built-in RPC mechanism. An attacker can send a crafted payload to the server, causing arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct array access:** By directly writing to out-of-bounds array indices within the Hobbes language itself (as shown in the REPL example).
- **RPC Mechanism:** Through the Hobbes RPC, a malicious actor can send a lambda function containing the out-of-bounds array indexing to a Hobbes server for remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** A local user who can execute Hobbes code can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Remote Attacker:** A remote attacker with network access to a Hobbes server that is listening for RPC connections can also trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted commands and function definitions.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The exploit described involves a Global Offset Table (GOT) hijacking technique. The attacker uses the OOB write to overwrite a function pointer in the GOT, redirecting execution to attacker-controlled shellcode.
- The exploit spawns a bind shell on a specified port.
- The Hobbes interpreter, in its default configuration, places array buffers in an executable page, making shellcode execution simpler.
- The vulnerability affects the Hobbes interpreter version up to 2020-05-21.
