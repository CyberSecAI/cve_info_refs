Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13331:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or content type handling during file uploads in the GitLab wiki feature. Specifically, it involves allowing the upload of a specially crafted PNG file that actually contains SVG code. This SVG code, embedded within a PNG extension, can be executed as a script by the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows uploading of files with arbitrary content disguised as PNG files.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The embedded SVG code, when rendered by the browser, can execute arbitrary JavaScript. This is a stored XSS vulnerability as the malicious code is persisted within the GitLab wiki page.
*   **Improper Content Type Handling:** The system fails to correctly identify and handle the uploaded file, treating the malicious SVG as a legitimate image format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into wiki pages by uploading specially crafted PNG files.
*   The injected JavaScript can be used to perform actions such as:
    *   Stealing user cookies and session tokens
    *   Accessing sensitive information from the user's browser
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Rewriting HTML content of the page
*   The impact is amplified if the wiki pages are public, as a larger audience can be affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the wiki feature of GitLab. Specifically, by uploading a malicious file with a disguised format through a wiki page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account on GitLab or a project they can contribute to with the ability to create/edit wiki pages.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a PNG file that contains SVG code with JavaScript to be executed.
*   The attacker must have the ability to upload the malicious file and have it rendered on a page viewed by other users.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report mentions that the vulnerability was tested on Google Chrome, but it likely affects other browsers as well due to how they interpret image data and SVG.
*   The provided links to the attackerâ€™s proof-of-concept pages show how the issue can be triggered.
*   The attacker was able to use the file upload vulnerability to inject Javascript code, leading to stored XSS.
