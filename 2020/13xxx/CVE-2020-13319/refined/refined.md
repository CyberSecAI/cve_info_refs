Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks in the GitLab API endpoints for adding and resetting spent time on issues. Specifically, the API allows non-project members to modify time tracking data on issues they created, despite documentation stating that such actions are limited to project members.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inconsistent Authorization:** The vulnerability stems from inconsistent access control between the GitLab UI (where quick actions like `/spend` are correctly restricted for non-members) and the API, which incorrectly allows these actions.
- **Missing API Access Control:** The API endpoints for `add_spent_time` and `reset_spent_time` lack proper validation to ensure the user is a project member before allowing the changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Non-project members can add arbitrary spent time to issues they've created.
- Non-project members can reset the spent time on issues they've created, potentially disrupting project time tracking and reporting.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through direct API calls using the `add_spent_time` and `reset_spent_time` endpoints.
- Attackers can use a private API token to authenticate these calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a non-member of the project.
- They must have created an issue in a public project.
- They need a valid private API token.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by "ashish_r_padelkar" through the HackerOne platform.
- The issue affects GitLab.com and potentially self-hosted GitLab instances.
- The description indicates that quick actions in the UI prevent this behavior but the API does not enforce the same restrictions.
- The provided commit information indicates the vulnerability was addressed on September 28, 2020.
