# Non members can add spent time and reset spent time from issues created by themselves- API

**[HackerOne report #755188](https://hackerone.com/reports/755188)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-12-10, assigned to [@ankelly](/ankelly "Andrew Kelly"):

### Summary

Hello,

As per this `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/time_tracking.html`

`Adding time entries (time spent or estimates) is limited to project members`

However, if the issue is created by non members themselves in a public project, they can add spent time and reset the spent time using APIs

1. `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html#add-spent-time-for-an-issue`
2. `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html#reset-spent-time-for-an-issue`

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a issue as a non member in public project.
2. If you try to use quick actions like `/Spend` , it wont work
3. Now try below API

```
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <Token>" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<ProjectID>/issues/<YourIssueID>/add_spent_time?duration=1h
```

This will add `1h` to your own issue

4. You can also RESET the time spent by project members using below API as a non member.

```
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <Token>" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<ProjectID>/issues/<YourIssueID>/reset_spent_time

```

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Allows non members to add/remove spent time on issues created by them

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

These 2 actions shouldn't be allowed using API too for non members

### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too. This is tested on gitlab.com

Regards,

Ashish

## Impact
