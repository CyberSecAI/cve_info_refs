The provided content relates to CVE-2020-13429.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The piechart panel in Grafana processes any JavaScript present in the "Values Header" configuration option without sanitization, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the "Values Header" configuration option.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser.
- This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload, such as `<img src=/ onerror=alert('piechart\_XSS')>`, and injects it into the "Values Header" configuration option of the piechart panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to modify the configuration of the piechart panel within Grafana. This could mean they have administrative access or have the ability to create or modify dashboards.
