The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13563.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the phpGACL library's improper handling of user-supplied input within its template functionality. Specifically, the `group_id` GET parameter is not properly sanitized when passed to the Smarty template engine, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization of the `group_id` parameter.
- The `group_id` parameter is rendered verbatim in the `assign_group.tpl` template and also within `pager.tpl` when referenced through the `link` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement of the webpage, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click a malicious link containing the crafted `group_id` parameter or trick the application to use the crafted parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't require any authentication or special privileges, just the ability to send crafted HTTP requests.
- The attacker needs to induce a victim to load the crafted URL in a browser or indirectly through an application that may consume the crafted parameter.
