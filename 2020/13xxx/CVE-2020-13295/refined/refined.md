{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The GitLab Runner's Docker client, used by shared runners, does not properly handle HTTP redirects from the Docker daemon. Specifically, the client follows redirects from the Docker REST API, even to local addresses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Improper handling of HTTP redirects"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform SSRF attacks targeting the Shared Runner's localhost, link-local, and local networks, with GET, POST, or DELETE HTTP(S) requests to arbitrary endpoints. This could lead to information disclosure and potential compromise of internal services.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious user can replace the existing `dockerd` with a malicious HTTPS server that sends redirect responses.",
      "Leveraging the fact that the public and private keys used by the docker daemon in the executor are also under the CI job's (user's) control."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute CI jobs within the GitLab environment that uses Shared Runners",
      "Ability to obtain a reverse shell into the Executor",
      "Ability to mount the host file system in the Executor",
      "Control of a malicious server to send redirect responses."

    ],
    "additional_details": "The attacker can partially obtain the response of a successful request (first character of the response) or fully obtain an error response.  Also, resource exhaustion through hanging jobs (when the HTTP response is a valid JSON), and resource exhaustion by sending large responses using gzip are also possible impact."
