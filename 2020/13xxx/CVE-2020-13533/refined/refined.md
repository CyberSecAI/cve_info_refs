Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure default permissions on specific files and registry keys used by the Dream Report application.
*   The `ods_rtm_launch` and `ods_usc` registry keys, point to executables (`RTM.exe` and `usc.exe`) with "full control" permissions granted to "Everyone". These keys are automatically executed when a new user logs in.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** The primary weakness is that the installed files and registry keys have overly permissive default access control lists (ACLs), granting "full control" to "Everyone".
*   **Registry Run Keys:** The use of registry run keys to execute binaries with weak permissions creates a backdoor opportunity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can replace the legitimate executables (`RTM.exe` and `usc.exe`) with malicious ones. When a user logs in, the malicious executable will run with the user's privileges.
*   **Backdoor Installation:** The attacker can effectively backdoor the installation and escalate privileges on subsequent user logins.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user logging in.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Dream Report is installed.
*   **File Replacement:** The attacker needs to be able to replace the legitimate executables with malicious ones. This is achieved because of the overly permissive file permissions.
*   **Registry Modification:** The attacker uses existing registry keys `ods_rtm_launch` and `ods_usc` but this is not a modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system.
*   **File Write Permissions:** The attacker must be able to write to the vulnerable file system path. This is possible due to the insecure default permissions
*   **Basic Understanding of Windows Registry:** Requires knowledge of registry run keys.
*   **Ability to create or obtain malicious executable:** Must be able to create or obtain the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report notes that these are default permissions. The vulnerability exists out-of-the-box.
*   The report provides specific registry paths for 32 bit and 64 bit operating systems.
*   The report gives the full command output for `cacls` that shows the vulnerable permissions.
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities in the Dream Report platform, also including CVE-2020-13532 and CVE-2020-13534.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Yuri Kramarz of Cisco Talos.
