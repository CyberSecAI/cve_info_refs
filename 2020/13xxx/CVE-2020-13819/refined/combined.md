device.

ExtremeXOS uses the IETF YANG data model for ACLs (ietf-access-
control-list) defined in RFC- 8519.

New FlexView for BOSS Power Supply Information
Serial Numbers and Power Supply information were not included in
the BOSS Chassis Components FlexView for ERS devices on which
BOSS 7.8.x or later was installed. The information is now in a new
FlexView called BOSS Power Supply Information.

Enhancement to Alarms in Extreme Management Center
Beginning in Extreme Management Center version 8.5.0, you can
open the map to which a device belongs from the Alarms tab.

VRRP Provisioning Support Added for VSP DevicesExtreme
Management Center now supports VRRP (Virtual Router
Redundancy Protocol) provisioning. Using the Configure Device >
VLAN Definitions tab, you can configure your VSP devices to form a
virtual router interface to act as a redundant forwarding element for
the network.

whether alarm, end-system event, and reporting are included in Extreme
Management Center backups.

Failed to Join Domain Alarm Added

A “Failed to Join Domain” alarm is now automatically generated in Extreme
Management Center when an engine is unable to join a domain and an event is
generated.

REST API Added to GIM

REST API has been added to GIM to increase the .CSV import level for devices

Fabric Attach and Switched UNI Enhancement

Extreme Management Center now supports Fabric Attach (FA) and Switched User
Network Interface (S-UNI) on the same port at the same time.

This feature is supported by VSP firmware version 8.1.1 and later, and on all
platforms currently supported by Extreme Management Center with two
exceptions: XA1400 and VSP-8600.

Enhancements to VPEX

Extreme Management Center now supports the following Virtual Port Extender
(VPEX) configurations:

l VPEX Ring Topologies – When two VPEX cascades are linked together, they
form a VPEX ring. This type of ring provides a redundant connection from
any bridge port extender (BPE) in the ring to the controlling bridge (CB).
Extreme Management Center requires the controlling bridge to have
ExtremeXOS 30.6 or later.

9 of 42

1. Enhancements in Version 8.5

l One-Armed MLAGs – In this dual control configuration, the first tier BPEs are
only connected to one of the two controlling bridges, which leaves more
trusted ports available. In some applications, BPEs are limited to only two
links for forming the ring, and the use of one-armed MLAGs is required.

Improvements to Server Certificates

The following improvements to server certificates are included in Extreme
Management Center version 8.5.0:

l PKCS#12/PFX keystores without a keystore password can be imported

l Unencrypted RSA private keys containing a "BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY"

header can be imported

The Network Status Summary PDF report has been updated to include the
following enhancements:

l Reports display Top 10 instead of Top 5 statistics.

l New “Top 10 WLANs by Clients” and “Top 10 Clients by Bandwidth” reports

have been added.

l Enhanced color and graphic resolution for all reports.

l Ability to select a site and generate a Network Status Summary based on the

activity for that site.

l Scheduling capability to generate the Network Status Summary on an hourly,

daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

The Network Status Summary reports are now also available in the Reports
Catalog under the Network option in the left-panel tree.

New Wireless FloorPlans Summary Added

A new FloorPlans Summary report, which displays AP, WLAN and Client data
based on selected floorplans, has been added to Extreme Management Center's
Reports Catalog under the Wireless option in the left-panel tree. You can also
schedule the FloorPlan Summary to generate hourly, daily, weekly or monthly
reports.

10 of 42

1. Enhancements in Version 8.5

Enhancements to ExtremeConnect

Several enhancements have been made to ExtremeConnect, including:

l New custom end-system data fields and additional operating system data

fields have been added to ExtremeConnect.

l Extreme Management Center backups now include ExtremeConnect

configurations.

l Beginning with Extreme Management Center version 8.5, the following

ExtremeConnect modules are hidden by default:

l FiberlinkMaaS360

l FntCommand

l Intune

l McAfee Dxl

l McAfee EPO

l MobileIron

l MSLync SDN

l OpenStack

l Sophos Mdm

l Xen Desktop

l Xen Server

Extreme Management Center Issues Addressed

Scheduled Firmware Upgrades and Archives are now listed in the
Scheduled Tasks View, where the scheduled actions can be
canceled. Events are logged when the schedules are added and
when they are canceled.

The watchdog.log and appmonitor.log files could not be
configured to remove the oldest files. Now the cleanLogs script is
included with Extreme Management Center so that only the latest 10
files are saved.

Devices with a Poll Type of Maintenance no longer periodically
issue SNMP requests in order to check for component changes.

SNMP timeouts were occurring when Extreme Management Center
was communicating with third-party devices.

Management Center options for displaying MAC addresses with an
OUI prefix were not available.

Discover was not being allowed for valid Sites based on the "Add
Device" capability. The capability for "Sites Read/Write Access" is not
necessary for Site Discover, but it is necessary for adding or editing
sites.

3. Known Issues and Vulnerabilities Addressed

QoS and EAPs fields were required fields to create VLAN scripts for
EXOS in Extreme Management Center. Now, the Create_VLAN
scripts for EXOS have been updated to treat QoS and EAPs as
optional fields.

The default TransferProtocol setting for the Cisco Vendor Profile
database was previously set incorrectly.

The Archive Restore function was not displaying a warning if the
archive was from a different model type.

The Scheduled Task Name, Description, and Subject values were
reverting back to default values after being changed during editing.

NMS-BASE license now allows you to enable, disable and add a port
to a group via the right-click Port drop-down list in the Devices >
Device view.

The Interface History PDF was unclear because it was missing titles
on three area charts and multi-line charts were using the same colors
for each line.

The Generate Show Support feature was not showing the current
status when navigating away and back.

The MLAG Summary report was displaying information from more
than one MLAG pair when devices had identical MLAG
configurations.

Attempting to set an EXOS device's restart time to a date more than a
month ahead would fail, indicating that the proposed reboot time was
in the past.

Extreme Management Center was indicating that devices had
exceeded device memory usage on EXOS and was generating
alarms, although the devices appeared to have plenty of memory
available.

The Mgmt [4095] VLAN for ExtremeXOS devices was incorrectly able
to be added to the Tagged list for a port in Extreme Management
Center. Now, the Mgmt [4095] VLAN is no longer selectable in the
Tagged list for a port.

The maximum SNMP Compass search time has been expanded
from 2 minutes to 10 minutes to support larger deployments.

Workflow paths with a conditional expression were not working for
device specific variables, causing Workflows to fail.

Firmware upgrades were not allowed for devices set to Maintenance /
Remove from Service.

netSNMP log messages were being merged with the device trap
message in the Extreme Management Center > Event view.

Archive menu options were hidden when permission for firmware
upgrade was removed from user permissions.

EXOS 8 Stacks were sometimes timing out before completing archive
backup.

The ICX-7450 stacks with 2 units were mapping as one single system
in Extreme Management Center.

In the Devices table, the Firmware column was displaying the Boot
ROM version for Aruba 2930F.

Workflows triggered by an alarm/event were only working for devices
that existed in the Extreme Management Center database, but not for
missing or unknown devices.

Multiple devices were not able to be removed from device groups. A
Remove from Group option has been added to the device table which
allows multiple devices to be removed at the same time.

The Manage SSH Configuration > Create/Edit/Delete functionality
was not working properly on the Administration > Users tab.

Logical ports on third-party devices were counting against the license
limit.

The MLAG Summary report, generated from the Network > Devices
tab, was displaying unnecessary MLAG information.

End-system groups that were deleted or renamed in Extreme
Management Center were being deleted from GIM Onboarding
Templates. Now, when end system groups are deleted in Extreme
Management Center, a warning message is shown in GIM when the
Onboarding Template is opened for editing.

The Devices > Device > Ports view was not displaying Cisco Fabric
Extender ports correctly.

A message was displaying that a VLAN name could not be modified
when it was assigned to a port. That message no longer displays
because names of VLANs that are assigned to ports can be changed.

The Syslog and Trap “Ignore IP List” filter was not being applied to
new trap or syslog messages.

The Archive Compare File Swap feature was not swapping the
displayed files.

ExtremeAnalytics Issues Addressed

In ExtremeAnalytics, the Application Server compound collector was
not respecting the limit of top 100 apps and top 100 servers per app.

The ExtremeAnalytics > Engine License Rates chart was incorrectly
displaying significantly less unique end-system counts than were
observed.

ExtremeControl Issues Addressed

In the Control> Dashboard> Overview Report page, Authentication
Type wasn’t launching the filtered end-systems table correctly, and in
the Control> Dashboard> Health Report pate, Risk Level wasn’t
launching the filtered end-systems table correctly.

End systems were displaying as "MAC" authenticated on the Control
> End System tab when an X session was active on the switch.

The value of sysObjectID was being incorrectly set for
ExtremeControl engines.

Resetting End-System diagnostics by MAC or IP address was not
completely disabling diagnostics.

The AAA Rule Configuration> Supported RADIUS Type incorrectly
included PAP and EAP-TTLS with tunneled PAP as options for
NTLM authentication. Those options have been removed to clarify
this field.

End-System table live updates were not being filtered by zone when
viewed with view access limited to specified zones.

Sorting some Access Control > Policy Mapping table columns was
throwing exceptions if any values were empty.

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

If you have requested an Extreme Management Center evaluation license, you received
an Entitlement ID. This Entitlement ID allows you to generate a product evaluation
license key. Refer to the instructions included with the Entitlement ID to generate the
license key. Use the key when you install the product.

Evaluation licenses are valid for 30 days. To upgrade from an evaluation license to a
purchased copy, contact your Extreme Networks Representative to purchase the
software. Refer to the Upgrading an Evaluation License section of the Extreme
ManagementCenterInstallationGuidefor instructions on upgrading your evaluation
license.

IMPORTANT: The Compliance tab is available and supported by Extreme on an

Extreme Management Center engine running the Linux operating system
supplied by Extreme. Other Linux operating systems can support
ExtremeCompliance functionality, but python version 2.7 or higher must be
installed. Additionally ExtremeCompliance functionality requires the git,
python2, python mysql module, python setuptools module, and python
"pygtail" module packages be installed and related dependencies
managed by the customer for their server’s unique operating system and
version.

4.1.1 Installing Without an Internet Connection

If your Linux system requires an operating system upgrade, you are prompted to upgrade
using either an internet connection or locally (without an internet connection) if no
additional Ubuntu packages need to be installed.

!!! ATTENTION !!!

We can attempt to upgrade the OS without using the internet if
there were no extra Ubuntu packages installed. If there were
extraneous packages installed, the upgrade will fail with this
method.

Do you want to attempt a local in-place upgrade of the OS and
reboot when complete? (Y/n)

4.1.2 Custom FlexViews

When reinstalling Extreme Management Center Console, the installation program saves
copies of any FlexViews you created or modified in the

23 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

<install directory>
\.installer\backup\current\appdata\System\FlexViews folder.

If you are deploying FlexViews via the Extreme Management Center server, save them
in the appdata\VendorProfiles\Stage\MyVendorProfile\FlexViews\My
FlexViews folder.

4.1.3 Custom MIBs and Images

If you are deploying MIBs via the Extreme Management Center server, they are saved in
the appdata\VendorProfiles\Stage\MyVendorProfile\MIBs\ folder.

If you are deploying device images (pictures) via the Extreme Management Center
server, they are saved in the
appdata\VendorProfiles\Stage\MyVendorProfile\Images\ folder.

4.2 Important Upgrade Considerations

Extreme Management Center 8.5.0 supports upgrades from Extreme Management
Center version 8.3.x or 8.4.x. If you are upgrading from version 8.1 or earlier of
NetSight/Extreme Management Center, you must perform an intermediate upgrade. For
example, if you are upgrading from NetSight 8.1, you must first upgrade to the latest
Extreme Management Center 8.3 or 8.4 release, then to 8.5.0.

IMPORTANT: When performing an upgrade, be sure to back up the database prior to

performing the upgrade, and save it to a safe location. Use the
Administration > Backup/Restore tab to perform the backup.

l When upgrading the Extreme Management Center server, ExtremeAnalytics
engine, or ExtremeControl engine to version 8.5.0, ensure the DNS server IP
address is correctly configured.

l When upgrading to Extreme Management Center version 8.5.0, if you adjusted the

Extreme Management Center memory settings and want them to be saved on
upgrade, a flag (-DcustomMemory) needs to be added to the
/usr/local/Extreme_Networks/NetSight/services/nsserver.cfg
file.

For example:
-Xms12g -Xmx24g -XX:HeapDumpPath=../../nsdump.hprof -
XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:MetaspaceSize=128m -
DcustomMemory

24 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

l If your network is using ExtremeAnalytics or ExtremeControl engines, Fabric

Manager, or another add-on feature, you must first perform the Extreme
Management Center upgrade to version 8.5.0 and then add the feature.

l If you are running Data Center Manager (DCM), a Mobile Device Management
(MDM) integration, or other ExtremeConnect or Fusion integration with Extreme
Management Center, or are accessing Web Services directly or through
ExtremeConnect, you need to install an Extreme Management Center Advanced
(NMS-ADV) license. Contact your Extreme Networks Representative for
information on obtaining this license.

4.2.1 License Renewal

Upgrading to Extreme Management Center version 8.5 requires you to renew your NMS
license if generated prior to July 31, 2020. Licenses generated prior to July 31, 2020
expire 90 days after upgrading to Extreme Management Center version 8.5.

4.2.2 Upgrading Hardware

When attempting to upgrade the Extreme Management Center server, the
ExtremeAnalytics engine, or the ExtremeControl engine to version 8.5.0, the upgrade
might not complete successfully. If the upgrade is not successful, begin the upgrade
again.

4.2.3 Free Space Consideration

When upgrading to Extreme Management Center version 8.5.0, a minimum of 15 GB of
free disk space is required on the Extreme Management Center server.

To increase the amount of free disk space on the Extreme Management Center server,
perform the following:

l Decrease the number of Extreme Management Center backups (by default, saved
in the /usr/local/Extreme_Networks/NetSight/backup directory).

l Decrease the Data Persistence settings (Administration > Options > Access

Control > Data Persistence).

l Remove unnecessary archives (Network > Archives).

l Delete the files in the <installation

directory>/NetSight/.installer directory.

25 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

4.2.4 Site Discover Consideration

Discovering devices via the Site tab using a Range, Subnet, or Seed discover might not
successfully add all expected devices. To correct the issue, increase the Length of
SNMP Timeout value on the Administration > Options > Site tab in the Discover First
SNMP Request section.

4.3 ExtremeAnalytics Upgrade Information

Enabling or disabling the disk flow export feature might cause enforce operations to time
out. Enforcing again resolves the issue.

When you delete an ExtremeXOS device that is configured as a flow source via the Flow
Sources table of the Analytics > Configuration > Engines > Configuration tab from the
Devices list on the Network > Devices tab, an error message is generated in the
server.log. The message does not warn you that the device is in use as a flow
source. Adding the device back in the Devices list on the Network > Devices tab or
removing the device from the Flow Source table fixes the issue.

The Flow Sources table on the Analytics > Configuration > engine> Configuration tab
may take a few minutes to load.

4.4 ExtremeControl Upgrade Information

4.4.1 General Upgrade Information

Before upgrading to Extreme Management Center 8.5.0, upgrade your ExtremeControl
engine version to 8.3 or 8.3. Additionally, both Extreme Management Center and the
ExtremeControl engine must be at version 8.5.0 in order to take advantage of the new
ExtremeControl 8.5.0 features.

NOTE: ExtremeControl 8.5 functionality is not supported on the 2S Series and 7S Series

ExtremeWireless Controllers.

You can download the latest ExtremeControl engine version at the Extreme Portal:
https://extremeportal.force.com. Be sure to read the UpgradingtoExtremeControl8.5
document (available on the Documentation tab of the Portal) for important information.

26 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

In addition, if your ExtremeControl solution utilizes a Nessus assessment server,
upgrade your assessment agent adapter to version 8.5.0 if you upgrade to the
ExtremeControl engine 8.5.0. Version 8.5.0 of the assessment agent adapter requires an
operating system with a 64-bit architecture.

4.4.2 ExtremeControl Version 8.0 and later

Beginning in version 8.0, ExtremeControl may fail to join Active Directory when
accessing as a Standard Domain User with Descendant Computer Objects ("Reset
password" permissions only) group member.

To allow this functionality, add the following permissions:

l Reset Password

l Validated write to DNS host name

l Validated write to service principal

l Read and write account restrictions

l Read and write DNS host name attributes

l Write servicePrincipalName

4.4.3 Other Upgrade Information

Immediately after you install version 8.5.0 on the ExtremeControl engine, the date and
time does not properly synchronize and the following error message displays:

WARNING: Unable to synchronize to a NTP server. The time might
not be correctly set on this device.

Ignore the error message and the date and time automatically synchronize after a short
delay.

Additionally, the following message might display during the ExtremeControl upgrade to
version 8.5:

No domain specified

To stop domain-specific winbindd process, run /etc/init.d/winbindd stop
{example-domain.com}

27 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

4.5 Fabric Configuration Information

4.5.1 Certificate

Fabric Manager might be unavailable via Extreme Management Center after upgrading if
the certificate is missing in Extreme Management Center Trust store.

To ensure Fabric Manager is available, enter the Fabric Manager certificate in the
Extreme Management Center Trust store using Generate Certificate option.

4.5.2 Authentication Key

When you provision authentication keys for Fabric Attach, the key cannot be read back
for security reasons. When the key is read from the device, it always shows "****". For
this reason, it might seem that there is a configuration mismatch when one does not
exist.

4.5.3 Service Configuration Change

If you change a configured service via the Configure Device window that references one
of the following, and then enforce those changes to the device, the configuration on the
device might change unexpectedly:

l MLT

l SMLT

l Port-specific settings to a port belonging to an MLT or SMLT

To prevent this merge, change rows in the Enforce Preview window where MLT or
SMLT are in use from Current to Desired.

To correct the issue after enforcement, modify the service on the device via the CLI.

4.5.4 CLIP Addresses

Using the CLIP Addresses table in the Configure Device window, you can enter
addresses in both IPv4 and IPv6 formats. However, Extreme Management Center
version 8.5.0 only supports applying a single address (either IPv4 or IPv6) to a Loopback
Interface.

4.5.5 Gateway Address Configuration Change

In versions of Extreme Management Center prior to 8.5.0, the Default Gateway IP
Address is configured as part of the VLAN. In 8.5, the Default Gateway IP Address is

28 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

configured as part of the VRF.

When enforcing VRFs to a device after upgrading to version 8.5, merge any Default
Gateway IP Addresses from the device into the configuration of Extreme Management
Center to prevent incorrect configuration of the device.

4.5.6 Upgrading VSP-8600

When upgrading from Extreme Management Center version 8.2 to version 8.3. manually
reload previously discovered VSP-8600 devices to gain access to Fabric Connect
features.

4.5.7 Removing Fabric Connect Configuration

Removing a device's Fabric Connect configuration by setting the Topology Definition to
<None> may fail if the device has Logical Interfaces assigned to ISIS.

4.5.8 Password Configuration

Fabric Manager fails to onboard in Extreme Management Center if the root password
includes an ampersand (&) character. Additionally, if the Administration > Inventory
Manager > SCP tab contains a password that includes an ampersand (&) in Extreme
Management Center, the Fabric Manager firmware does not download successfully.

Ensure you use a password without an ampersand (&) character.

4.5.9 VRF Configuration

VSP SNMP performance is adversely affected as the number of VRF configurations
increases. This issue can be resolved by upgrading to VSP release 8.1.1 or later or
VSP8600 series version 6.3.3 or later.

4.6 Device Configuration Information

4.6.1 VDX Device Configuration

To properly discover interfaces and links for VDX devices in Extreme Management
Center, enable three-tuple-if on the device.

NOTE: To enable three-tuple-if on the device in Extreme Management Center:

1. Access the Network > Devices tab.

2. Right-click on the device in the Devices table.

3. Select Tasks > Config > VDX Config Basic Support.

29 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

Additionally, for Extreme Management Center to display VCS fabric , the NOS version
must be 7.2.0a or later.

Rediscover VDX devices after upgrading to Extreme Management Center version 8.4.2.

4.6.2 VSP Device Configuration

Topology links from VSP devices to other VSP or ERS devices might not display in a
topology map (or might display inconsistently). To ensure topology map links display
correctly, verify that the VSP device is configured to publish its management IP address
in the autotopology (SONMP) data.

Ensure that the output of show sys setting command shows:

autotopology : on
ForceTopologyIpFlag : true
clipId-topology-ip : 0

If the output values displayed are different, configure the VSP device to publish
management IP address in SONMP data by executing the following CLI commands:

(config)# autotopology
(config)# sys force-topology-ip-flag enable
(config)# default sys clipId-topology-ip

The Status of LAG links in maps will start working after the next polling following an
upgrade to Extreme Management Center version 8.4. You can initiate the polling of a
device by performing a refresh/rediscovery of the device.

4.6.3 ERS Device Configuration

ERS devices might automatically change VLAN configurations you define in Extreme
Management Center. To disable this, change the vlan configcontrol setting for
ERS devices you add to Extreme Management Center by entering the following in the
device command line:

CLI commands
enable
config term
vlan configcontrol flexible

Additionally, configure all VLANs on the port for an ERS device with the same tag status
(tagged or untagged). If enforcing to an ERS device on which a port has at least one
VLAN as tagged, Extreme Management Center adds all untagged VLANs to the tagged
VLAN list and clears the untagged VLAN list.

30 of 42

4. Installation, Upgrade, and Configuration Changes

Creating an archive for ERS devices using the Network > Archives tab does not
complete successfully if Menu mode (cmd-interface menu) is used instead of CLI mode
(cmd-interface cli). Use CLI mode to create the archive.

4.6.4 SLX Device Configuration

When creating a ZTP+ Configuration for an SLX 9240 on which firmware version
18s.01.01 or 18s.01.02 is installed, the ZTP+ process fails if the Administration Profile
value uses SSH or Telnet CLI credentials. Extreme Management Center indicates that
the SSH or CLI profile is not supported by the device.

To create a ZTP+ configuration for an SLX 9240:

1. Create a new Device Profile with the CLI Credential set to < No Access >.

NOTE: The SLX ZTP+ Connector does NOT support configuring CLI credentials on the

device.

2. Create the ZTP+ Configuration and select the new Device Profile you created in

Step 1 as the Administration Profile.

3. After the ZTP+ process successfully completes and the device is added to Extreme
Management Center, select a Device Profile that uses the correct CLI credentials
for the SLX device in the Administration Profile.

4.6.5 ExtremeXOS Device Configuration

ExtremeXOS devices on which firmware version 30.3.1.6 is installed do not download
and install new firmware versions successfully via the ZTP+ process. To correct the
issue, access the Network > Firmware tab in Extreme Management Center, select the
ExtremeXOS device you are updating via ZTP+, and change the Version field in the
Details right-panel from builds/xos_30.3/30.3.1.6 to 30.3.1.6.

4.7 Firmware Upgrade Configuration Information

Extreme Management Center supports firmware downloads and uploads to devices
using TFTP, FTP, SCP, and SFTP. However, before firmware images can be
downloaded or uploaded from the server, Extreme Management Center needs the root
path or directory for each of the protocols. The following default root paths for each
protocol are configurable from the Administration > Options > Inventory Manager tab:

Protocol Root Path:

31 of 42

5. System Requirements

l TFTP: /tftpboot/firmware/images/

l FTP: /tftpboot/firmware/images/

l SCP: /root/firmware/images/

l SFTP: /root/firmware/images/

To upload firmware images that are 2 GB or less to the server, use the Extreme
Management Center Network > Firmware tab. For files larger than 2 GB, use a third-
party client (such as SCP, WinSCP, or FTP).

For example, to use SCP to upload a firmware image to the SCP root path on the server,
enter the following:

l scp <LOCAL_FIRMWARE_PATH> root@<Extreme Management Center_

SERVER_IP>:/root/firmware/images

l Where:

l <ExtremeManagementCenter_SERVER_IP>= IP Address to Extreme

Management Center Server

l <LOCAL_FIRMWARE_PATH>= fully qualified path to a firmware image on

the client machine

4.8 Wireless Manager Upgrade Information

A High Availability pair cannot be added as a flow source if the WLAN(s) selected are
not in common with both wireless controllers.

Following a Wireless Manager upgrade, clear the Java Cache before starting the
Extreme Management Center client.

5. System Requirements

IMPORTANT: Wireless event collection is disabled by default in version 8.5.0 due to the increase

in disk space usage required. To enable event collection, select Enable Event
Collection on the Administration > Options > Event Analyzer tab.

desktop-supported browsers available on a mobile device. Before login, make sure
to select the Desktop site option in the browser options.

6. Getting Help

l Guest and IoT Manager Application is best viewed in 1920 x 1080 resolution or

higher. Lower resolutions might result in improper layouts in some cases.

l If you are using self-signed certificates, they must be added in the Trusted Root
Certificate store on the client machine or you might observe issues in the “print”
use cases. This is only applicable for Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Internet
Explorer browsers.
