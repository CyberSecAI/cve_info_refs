Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13673:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of user-supplied input within the Drupal core Media module and the Entity Embed module. Specifically, the modules allow embedding media and entities in content fields. The issue lies in how these modules handle the embedding process, potentially leading to the injection of malicious HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Although the advisory title mentions CSRF, the description points more towards a stored XSS vulnerability. The vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to inject HTML into a page when a trusted user accesses it. This is achieved through the embedding mechanisms of the Media/Entity Embed modules, which can be considered a form of CSRF-like behavior since a user interaction triggers the vulnerability.

*   **HTML Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary HTML into a web page. This occurs because the filtering of user-provided media/entity embed information is insufficient.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The HTML injection vulnerability can potentially lead to XSS if the injected HTML contains malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML into pages that will be viewed by other users. This could range from defacing the website to phishing attempts.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the injected HTML contains malicious JavaScript, an attacker can perform a wide range of actions, such as:
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unprivileged User Input:** The attack vector involves an unprivileged user who can supply input to the media/entity embedding system. This is usually done through a content creation form or a similar interface that enables the embedding of media or entities.
*   **Trusted User Interaction:** The attack is realized when a trusted user (e.g., an administrator or content editor) with permissions to embed media or entities views the page containing the malicious HTML injected by the unprivileged user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege Account:** The attacker needs a user account with the ability to input data into the media/entity embed feature, but does not need to have special permissions such as content administrator or editor.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge that the filtering is insufficient and be able to craft malicious HTML for injection.
*   **Targeted User Interaction:** The attacker needs a trusted user to load the page where malicious HTML has been injected.
