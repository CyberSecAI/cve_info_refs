# Drupal core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Request Forgery - SA-CORE-2021-006

Project: [Drupal core](/project/drupal)Date: 2021-September-15Security risk: [**Moderately critical** 10 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:User/CI:None/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:Default](/security-team/risk-levels "AC - Access complexity: Basic or routine (user must follow specific path)
A - Authentication: User-level access (basic/commonly assigned permissions)
CI - Confidentiality impact: No confidentiality impact
II - Integrity impact: Some data can be modified
E - Exploit (Zero-day impact): Theoretical or white-hat (no public exploit code or documentation on development exists)
TD - Target distribution: Default or common module configurations are exploitable, but a config change can disable the exploit")Vulnerability: Cross Site Request ForgeryAffected versions: >= 8.0.0 <8.9.19 || >= 9.1.0 <9.1.13 || >=9.2.0 <9.2.6CVE IDs: CVE-2020-13673Description:

The Drupal core Media module allows embedding internal and external media in content fields. In certain circumstances, the filter could allow an unprivileged user to inject HTML into a page when it is accessed by a trusted user with permission to embed media. In some cases, this could lead to cross-site scripting.

This advisory is not covered by [Drupal Steward](/steward).

Also see [Entity Embed - Moderately critical - Cross Site Request Forgery - SA-CONTRIB-2021-028](https://www.drupal.org/sa-contrib-2021-028) which addresses a similar vulnerability for that module.

*Updated 18:15 UTC to clarify text.*

Solution:

Install the latest version:

* If you are using Drupal 9.2, update to [Drupal 9.2.6](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.2.6).
* If you are using Drupal 9.1, update to [Drupal 9.1.13](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.1.13).
* If you are using Drupal 8.9, update to [Drupal 8.9.19](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.19).

Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.9.x and versions of Drupal 9 prior to 9.1.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage.

Drupal 7 core is not affected.

This advisory addresses a similar issue to [Drupal core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Request Forgery - SA-CORE-2021-006](https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2021-006).

The Entity Embed module provides a filter to allow embedding entities in content fields. In certain circumstances, the filter could allow an unprivileged user to inject HTML into a page when it is accessed by a trusted user with permission to embed entities. In some cases, this could lead to cross-site scripting.

Solution:

Install the latest version:

* If you use the Entity Embed module for Drupal 8 or 9, upgrade to [Entity Embed 8.x-1.2](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_embed/releases/8.x-1.2).

Drupal 7 versions of Entity Embed do not have a stable release and therefore do not receive security coverage.
