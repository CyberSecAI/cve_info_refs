Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-13578:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `soap_wsse_get_BinarySecurityTokenX509` function within the Genivia gSOAP WS-Security plugin.
- The `data` pointer, used to store the decoded X509 certificate, is not initialized, leading to use of uninitialized memory
- This uninitialized `data` pointer is then passed to `d2i_X509` which attempts to decode a X509 certificate from the memory location that the pointer points to, leading to a crash due to dereferencing invalid memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uninitialized Pointer:** The primary issue is the use of an uninitialized `data` pointer.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference**: Although not strictly a NULL pointer dereference the uninitialized pointer is being dereferenced which could lead to a crash depending on the memory location that the pointer is pointing to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition due to a crash, making the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SOAP Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SOAP request containing a `BinarySecurityToken` element.
- **HTTP Request:** The SOAP request is sent over HTTP, making it accessible over a network.
- **Specific Token:** A `BinarySecurityToken` with specific `EncodingType` and `ValueType` attributes is needed to trigger the vulnerability. Specifically, if the EncodingType is set but doesn't match the hardcoded URIs and the ValueType is set to "wsse_X509v3URI" then the uninitialized data pointer is used by `d2i_X509`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the service that is using the vulnerable gSOAP library.
- **Ability to Craft SOAP Requests:** The attacker must be able to generate SOAP requests to exploit the vulnerability.
