Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13783:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `tools_admin.php` page stores the admin password in clear text within the HTML source code of the webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):** The admin password is not encrypted or hashed and is stored as plain text in the HTML source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** An attacker with physical access to a machine that is logged into the router's web interface can easily view the admin password by inspecting the page's HTML source.
- **Complete Router Control:** With the admin password, the attacker gains complete access to the router's configuration, potentially leading to further malicious activities, such as changing settings, accessing the network, or installing malicious firmware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who has physical access to a computer that is logged into the routerâ€™s web interface. The attacker must be able to inspect the source code of the `tools_admin.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical access** to a machine logged into the router's web interface
- **Ability to inspect HTML source code** of a webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability does not involve network transmission of the password in cleartext, only the storage within the browser's rendered HTML.
