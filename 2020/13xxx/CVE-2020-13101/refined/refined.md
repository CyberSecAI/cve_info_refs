{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The combination of the InlineXML option (XML payload within the DSS transport document) and a specially crafted XMLDSig allows an attacker to circumvent the non-repudiation property of the signature.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The DSS core 1.0 specification does not properly handle XMLDSig with the InlineXML option."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can circumvent the non-repudiation property of the signature.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a specific XMLDSig that leverages the InlineXML option within a DSS transport document."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft a specially crafted XMLDSig and have the ability to interact with a system using the vulnerable DSS implementation.",
    "additional_info": "The recommended mitigation is to move to DSS-X core 2.0 or deny the use of the InlineXML option."
