- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the `mosquitto.exe` executable and other files/folders within the Moxa MXView installation directory. The "Users" group has full control, allowing any user to modify these files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure file system permissions. The "Users" group has full control over critical files and folders required by the MXView service.
    - The MXView service executes `mosquitto.exe` and other executables with NT SYSTEM privileges, creating an opportunity for privilege escalation if an attacker can modify these executables.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can replace the legitimate `mosquitto.exe` (or other executables/dlls) with a malicious binary. When the MXView service executes this modified binary, the attacker gains arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local file system manipulation. The attacker needs local access to the system where Moxa MXView is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user on the system where the vulnerable Moxa MXView software is installed and must be able to write files to the file system where the vulnerable executables reside.
