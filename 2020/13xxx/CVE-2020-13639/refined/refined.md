Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-13639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It occurs because user-supplied input submitted as feedback through the `/ECT_Provider/` endpoint is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores the malicious script within the feedback data.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: User-provided input is not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious JavaScript code is executed within the context of the administrator's browser when they view the feedback submitted by unauthenticated users.
- This can potentially lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities, depending on the payload's complexity and access levels of the administrator user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by submitting feedback with a malicious JavaScript payload to `/ECT_Provider/` endpoint.
- The payload is then stored in the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to submit malicious feedback.
- The attacker only needs network access to the OutSystems application to submit a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be logged into the application.
- The attack requires an administrator to view the malicious feedback, triggering the stored XSS.
