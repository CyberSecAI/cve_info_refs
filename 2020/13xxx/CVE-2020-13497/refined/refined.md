The provided content relates to CVE-2020-13497.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking when accessing the `_strings` array within the `GetString` function of the Pixar OpenUSD library when parsing a malformed USD file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `GetString` function.
- The `GetString` function uses an index read from the USD file to access the `_strings` array without verifying that the index is within the array's bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: By providing a crafted USD file with an out-of-bounds index, an attacker can read arbitrary memory, which can leak sensitive process information.
- Potential memory corruption: The out-of-bounds read could be leveraged to cause memory corruption.
- Bypassing mitigations: Information leaks could help bypass ASLR and other exploit mitigations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The victim needs to access a specially crafted, malformed USD file provided by the attacker.
- The file format parser attempts to read an index from the file's `FIELDS` section representing the `String` type. This index is used to retrieve the actual string using the `GetString()` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a malformed USD file.
- The victim must process the malformed USD file with a vulnerable version of Pixar OpenUSD.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing the `FIELDS` section of the `usd` file format, specifically when handling string types.
- The `_strings` array is populated when parsing the `STRINGS` section of the file, and there is no check to ensure the index is within bounds when later accessed via the index read from the `FIELDS` section.
- The `GetString` method uses the provided index to retrieve a string from an array of strings.
- The content provides a detailed crash analysis using AddressSanitizer (ASAN)
- The file format described is usually distributed in `usdz` archives.
- This vulnerability is related to two others, CVE-2020-13496 and CVE-2020-13498
