Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which aligns with CVE-2020-13443:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks on file extensions and MIME types during file uploads within the ExpressionEngine CMS. Specifically, the CMS uses a blacklist approach for file extensions, which is bypassed by adding a space encoded as `%20` at the end of the extension (e.g., `.php%20`). Additionally, the MIME type check can be circumvented by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (like PNG) that contains malicious PHP code within its comment section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insufficient Blacklisting:** The CMS relies on a blacklist of file extensions. This approach is flawed, as it's easy to find ways to bypass the blacklist by using variations of known dangerous extensions.
2.  **MIME Type Bypass:** The MIME type validation can be bypassed by crafting a file with a valid MIME type but with malicious content (PHP code) inside.
3.  **Direct Access to Uploaded Files:** The application stores uploaded files directly under the web root, which allows for direct access to these files without any short alias, leading to direct access to uploaded files.
4.  **Lack of Proper Sanitization:** The file name isn't properly sanitized and validated after the initial checks, allowing a modified filename to be used when the file is stored.
5.  **Low Privilege User Upload:** A low-privileged user (member) can upload files, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This results in **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, which could lead to:

*   Full compromise of the server.
*   Data theft or manipulation.
*   Installation of backdoors.
*   Website defacement.
*   Further attacks on other systems within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Messages Composer:** The vulnerability is triggered via the "Compose Msg" feature in the member messaging system.
2.  **File Upload:**  The attacker uploads a specially crafted file through the attachment functionality.
3.  **Direct Web Access:** The attacker accesses the uploaded file through the web server using the file path, triggering the execution of the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to be a registered member of the ExpressionEngine site or able to create a member with default group id 5 (default member group). This indicates that a public registration or forum feature with member registration enabled will be vulnerable.
2.  **Ability to Compose Messages:** The attacker needs to have the ability to compose and send messages within the messaging system.
3.  **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to bypass file extension and MIME type checks by appending `%20` to the extension and embedding code in a file with valid MIME type.
4.  **Network Access:** Remote network access to the affected web application.
