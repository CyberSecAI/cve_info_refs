Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13904:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in FFmpeg's HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) demuxer when parsing a crafted m3u8 playlist file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that a segment's filename pointer (`lpd.filename`) is freed during the parsing of the playlist file (specifically during `free_segment_dynarray` call in `hls.c`).  However, after freeing, the code attempts to access the freed memory location, resulting in the use-after-free. This occurs because `av_probe_input_format3` attempts to use the freed pointer at line 168 in format.c.
*   **Improper Duration Handling:**  The `EXTINF` duration value in an m3u8 file is not properly validated, leading to the freeing of resources, and later an attempt to read it when a very small duration is provided or not provided correctly. Specifically, the default EXTINF duration is not set when duration is smaller than 1ms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, which may result in a crash of the application or unpredictable behavior.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As demonstrated in the provided crash log, the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided content, use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if the attacker has enough control over memory layout and contents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted m3u8 File:** An attacker needs to create a specially crafted m3u8 playlist file.
*   **File Processing:** This crafted file is then processed by FFmpeg (e.g., using the `ffmpeg -i input_file` command).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation/Delivery:** An attacker needs to be able to create the malicious m3u8 file, and deliver it to a target system.
*   **FFmpeg Usage:** The attacker needs to have the target system or user process the crafted m3u8 file using a vulnerable version of FFmpeg.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability occurs during the call to `parse_playlist` which frees the `lpd.filename` pointer via the `free_segment_dynarray` call.
* The fix involves checking the segment duration and setting a default value to 1ms if duration is smaller than 1ms.
* The provided patch from patchwork.ffmpeg.org shows that the fix is implemented in `libavformat/hls.c`.
* The gentoo advisory notes that a successful exploit could result in arbitrary code execution.
* The ubuntu advisory notes the vulnerability can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
