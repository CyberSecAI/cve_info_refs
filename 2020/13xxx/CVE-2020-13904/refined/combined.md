Make sure to compile with fsanitize=address.

My configuration:

--cc=clang --extra-cflags='-O2 -g3 -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -Wno-error' --extra-ldflags='-O2 -g3 -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -Wno-error' --enable-debug

My command line is:

./ffmpeg -i input\_file

Make sure you don`t have a file named au\_to0.ts, It suppose to fail while trying to open it.

I compiled with various compilers and this specific input file with clang6.0 and ran the binary in Ubuntu 18.04.
