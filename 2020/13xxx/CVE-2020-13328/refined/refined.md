Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `package_presenter.rb` file, specifically in the `package_link` method. The `required_python` parameter, used when creating PyPi packages, is incorporated into an HTML anchor tag without proper sanitization, allowing for arbitrary HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `required_python` parameter. This code is then stored and displayed when a user accesses the PyPi simple API endpoint, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PyPi Package Creation:** The attacker creates a malicious PyPi package with a crafted `required_python` value containing XSS payload.
*   **Simple API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the simple API endpoint `/api/:version/projects/:id/packages/pypi/simple/*package_name` which displays the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab User:** The attacker needs to be a GitLab user with the ability to create PyPi packages within a project.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to be familiar with GitLab's PyPi API to upload the malicious package.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `required_python` field has a database constraint limiting it to 50 characters, but this doesn't prevent HTML injection.
*   The vulnerability is present on GitLab.com, which is mentioned in the "Output of checks" section.
*   The report mentions that the XSS is currently blocked by the Content Security Policy (CSP) on gitlab.com, however, the underlying vulnerability exists.
