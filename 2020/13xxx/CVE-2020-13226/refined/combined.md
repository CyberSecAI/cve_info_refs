### Describe your problem(s)

Currently, the API endpoint validation (`https://localhost:9443/api/am/publisher/v1.0/apis/validate-endpoint?endpointUrl=''`) in the Publisher portal takes place via a direct HTTP Head call initiated from the Publisher node. This can be further improved by routing this request through the Gateway node, even though the original behavior is the intended.

### Describe your solution

Make endpoint validation request goes through WSO2 API Gateway.

### How will you implement it

Deploy the API "ValidateEndpoint" by default for each tenant in API Gateway. If needed, provide admin users with the capability to set rate-limiting as well, so that request bursting will be prevented.

**Description:**

in a WSO2 API-M deployment, we recommend restricting outbound connections of the Publisher node only to the required internal nodes (only to the nodes which Publisher portal is intended to communicate with) of the deployment. So even if privileged user credentials were exploited to a user with malicious intent, they cannot perform unintended network interactions
