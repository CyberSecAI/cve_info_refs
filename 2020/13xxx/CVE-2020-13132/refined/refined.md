Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `ykpiv_util_generate_key()` function within the libykpiv library. Specifically, it involves an incorrect `free()` call in the cleanup section of the function. If the `ptr_modulus` variable is set, the code attempts to free the memory pointed to by the `modulus` variable, instead of the memory allocated for `ptr_modulus` itself. This leads to a double-free or free of unallocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Memory Management:** The primary weakness is the incorrect `free()` call, which can lead to memory corruption or a crash.
- **Error Handling Flaw:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific error condition, where the code reaches the cleanup section after some checks are successful, but a subsequent check fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. The incorrect `free()` call will result in a crash of the application using the libykpiv library, making it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Smartcard:** The attack vector involves using a malicious PIV smartcard that provides crafted responses during the RSA key generation process.
- **Specifically Crafted Response:** The malicious smartcard needs to provide specific responses that pass the initial checks in the function, but then trigger the incorrect free call in the cleanup section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the host machine to plug in a malicious smartcard.
- **Ability to Mimic PIV Smartcard:** The attacker must be able to create a device that mimics a PIV smartcard and can send specific, crafted responses to the host.
- **Knowledge of the Protocol:** The attacker needs to understand the PIV protocol and how the data structures are parsed to craft the correct responses to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specifically related to the RSA key generation path within the `ykpiv_util_generate_key()` function.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific error handling case and might not be obvious during normal use of the library, which explains why it was not found earlier.
- The vulnerability was found using fuzzing techniques.
- The issue is present in libykpiv versions before 2.1.0.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.0 of libykpiv.
- Yubico assigned a CVSSv3.1 score of 4.3 to this issue.
