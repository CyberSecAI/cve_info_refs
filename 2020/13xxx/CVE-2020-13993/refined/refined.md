Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-13993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **blind SQL injection vulnerability** present in the `screen_resolution_height` and `screen_resolution_width` parameters of the ticket submission functionality within the "Mods for HESK" (MFH) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly display the results of the SQL query, making it a blind SQL injection. Attackers need to infer information based on the application's behavior (e.g., time delays).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection allows unauthenticated attackers to retrieve sensitive information from the database, including ticket details and potentially user credentials if chained with other vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker can use the SQL injection to extract user information and password hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Ticket Submission:** The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a new ticket through the `submit_ticket.php` endpoint, specifically manipulating the `screen_resolution_height` and `screen_resolution_width` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely via the web application's public interface.
*   **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests with crafted parameters to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of the SQL structure**:  The attacker needs to use techniques for blind SQL injection to extract data without directly seeing the database responses.
*   The attacker needs to send multiple requests to gather the information.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post mentions that this vulnerability is present in "Mods for HESK" versions between -2019.1.0- and -June 28 2017 Version 3.1.0-.
*   The blog post highlights that the SQL injection is blind, requiring techniques to infer the database's structure.
*   It suggests that the SQL injection can be used in conjunction with XSS to exfiltrate user credentials and build a token for automatic login, providing a path to privilege escalation to admin user.
