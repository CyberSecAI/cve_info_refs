{
  "CVE-2020-13160": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a format string vulnerability that occurs when the AnyDesk application processes a UDP discovery packet. The application uses a format string in a vsnprintf call without sanitizing user-provided input.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Format string vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). By sending a crafted UDP packet, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target machine.",
    "Attack vectors": "A single crafted UDP packet sent to the target machine.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted UDP packet to the target machine. No prior authentication or interaction with the target system is required. The attacker must be able to reach the UDP port (50001) of the AnyDesk service process on the target machine. The attacker does not need to be on the same local network segment and can attack remotely."
  },
    "CVE-2022-24637": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a single quote/double quote confusion. Specifically, the header of a PHP cache file is defined as '<?php\\n...' instead of \"<?php\\n...\". The single quotes cause the backslash and n characters to be written literally, instead of being interpreted as a newline. This results in the cache file not being parsed as PHP code, but as plain text, thus leaking sensitive cache information.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Information disclosure due to improper quoting",
      "Arbitrary PHP file write"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can gain RCE by chaining the information disclosure vulnerability with the arbitrary PHP file write vulnerability. Information disclosure allows for bypassing authentication. Arbitrary PHP file write allows for injecting and executing arbitrary PHP code.",
    "Attack vectors": "The initial information disclosure vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP request. The arbitrary file write requires an HTTP POST request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making HTTP requests. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target system and have network access."
  },
  "CVE-2021-30145": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the use of sprintf within an undocumented feature of the mpv media player's custom 'mf://' protocol handler. The protocol handler does not properly validate the input it receives through the URL, allowing an attacker to use format specifiers which then get evaluated using sprintf.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Format string vulnerability",
      "Heap overflow vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The format string vulnerability, due to FORTIFY_SOURCE on Linux, has a limited impact. Though, the heap overflow can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting an adjacent heap chunk and setting a function pointer to an attacker controlled value. Exploitation probability in real-life is estimated as low.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious playlist file, such as an m3u file, containing a crafted URL using the 'mf://' protocol handler.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening a malicious playlist. The attacker needs detailed information about the victim's system to properly fine-tune the exploit. The attacker needs to have a network position to serve such playlist file."
