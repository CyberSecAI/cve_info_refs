{
  "CVE-2020-13388": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `jw.util` package's configuration loading functionality, specifically when loading from a stream with YAML, is vulnerable to arbitrary python command execution. This is because it uses `yaml.load` instead of `yaml.safe_load`, allowing an attacker to embed and execute python commands within loaded YAML data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of `yaml.load` instead of `yaml.safe_load`",
      "Insecure handling of YAML input",
      "Arbitrary code execution through YAML parsing"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Python commands on the system running the vulnerable software, leading to potential data breaches, data modification, or a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By inserting malicious Python code within a YAML source, which is then loaded using `jw.util`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have control over the YAML data that is being loaded by the vulnerable jw.util configuration function. No specific position is required as long as they can influence the YAML file used."
