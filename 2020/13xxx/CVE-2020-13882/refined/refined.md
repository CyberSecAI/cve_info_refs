Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-13882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU) race condition in the symlink detection routine of Lynis. This occurs when Lynis checks permissions on log and report files, but the files can be modified by an attacker between the check and the use of the files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **TOCTTOU Race Condition:** The core weakness is the race condition allowing an attacker to manipulate the log and report files after Lynis has checked them but before they are used.
*   **Bypassed Symlink Detection:** The intended symlink detection mechanism in Lynis is bypassed because of the race condition, allowing an attacker to use symlinks to manipulate the log and report files.
*   **Insufficient File Permission Checks**: The vulnerability highlights an issue in the permission checking routine that allows the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can manipulate the log and report files to cause a denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to retrieve additional system information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers might be able to achieve privilege escalation by manipulating the log and report files. This is the most severe potential impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to manipulate files during a specific time window between the permission check and the actual usage of log and report files by Lynis.
*   **Symlink Manipulation:**  The attacker exploits the ability to create and modify symlinks.
*   **Unprotected Symlinks:** The vulnerability is exacerbated if the kernel doesn't protect symlinks (`fs.protected_hardlinks` or `fs.protected_symlinks`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to create symlinks:**  The attacker must be able to create symlinks.
*   **Timing Awareness:** The attacker must have an understanding of the timing window where the race condition can be exploited.
* **Wait for Lynis Execution:** The attacker must wait for another (non-privileged) user to run Lynis.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Kernel Protection:** Linux users with kernel 3.6 or higher can mitigate this by setting `fs.protected_hardlinks=1` and `fs.protected_symlinks=1`.
*   **Upgrade Lynis:** Upgrading Lynis to version 3.0.0 or later, which includes the fix for the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sander Bos, and the fix was implemented by Katarina Durechova.
*   The vulnerability affects Lynis versions prior to 3.0.0, including the tested version 2.7.5.
*   The fix is included in Fedora updates for Fedora 31 and 32.
