Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-13435, extracted from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a result of a NULL pointer dereference within the `sqlite3ExprCodeTarget` function in the `expr.c` file of SQLite. This occurs due to an incorrect handling of certain expressions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The code attempts to dereference a pointer that may be NULL, leading to a crash. This happens during the processing of specific expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash or segmentation fault in SQLite, leading to a denial of service. The service or application using the vulnerable SQLite library will likely become unavailable.
*   **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources suggest the possibility of arbitrary code execution, though not as likely as a DoS, which could lead to further compromise if successfully exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious SQL Statements/Queries:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted SQL statements or queries.
*   **Processing Malformed Input:** The vulnerability can be exploited by feeding malformed input or database schemas to SQLite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Crafted SQL:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted SQL statement to the application using the vulnerable SQLite library.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges or authentication in some instances.
*   **Network Access**: In many cases remote exploitation is possible via network access since the vulnerable component is exposed over various protocols.

**Additional Information from Different Sources:**

*   **FreeBSD:** The FreeBSD Security Advisory mentions CVE-2020-13435 as a "null pointer dereference" vulnerability within the sqlite3 library, noting that it could be exploited by malicious SQL statements leading to crashes. However, FreeBSD does not expose this vulnerability to untrusted or remote users through base system components.
*   **Oracle:** The Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory indicates that CVE-2020-13435 is addressed in multiple Oracle products including Oracle Database Server (though not directly exploitable), Oracle Solaris, and others as part of third-party component updates.
*   **Apple:** Apple's security advisories for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and iTunes list CVE-2020-13435 as a denial-of-service vulnerability in SQLite, addressed through improved checks. Also, Apple notes there were multiple SQLite vulnerabilities addressed in various products by updating to sqlite 3.32.3.
*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Red Hat's bug tracking entry mentions that CVE-2020-13435 causes a segmentation fault in `sqlite3ExprCodeTarget` within the `expr.c` file, primarily affecting Fedora. It was resolved by updating the `sqlite` package.
*   **NetApp:** The NetApp advisory states that SQLite versions through 3.32.0 are vulnerable, and successful exploitation could lead to DoS.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo's advisory notes that the vulnerability is exploitable remotely and could result in arbitrary execution of code, which is addressed by upgrading the `dev-db/sqlite` package.
* **Ubuntu:** The Ubuntu Security Notice specifies CVE-2020-13435 affects the sqlite3 package and indicates an attacker could use the issue to cause SQLite to crash, resulting in a denial of service or possible arbitrary code execution.

In summary, CVE-2020-13435 is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in SQLite that can lead to a denial of service, and possibly arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted SQL queries or malformed input, and can be exploited remotely when the vulnerable component is exposed over a network. Multiple vendors have addressed this issue in various products.
