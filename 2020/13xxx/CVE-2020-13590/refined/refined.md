The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13590.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input within SQL queries. Specifically, the `selected_fields` parameter is directly injected into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `selected_fields` parameter within the `entities/fields` page.
- The vulnerability occurs in the `mulitple_edit`, `copy_selected` and `export` functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- The attacker could potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the application's `entities/fields` page.
- The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload within the `selected_fields` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated, either with administrator credentials or through cross-site request forgery.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
