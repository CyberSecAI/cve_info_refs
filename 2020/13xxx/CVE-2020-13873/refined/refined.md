Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-13873) found in Codoforum:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$tid`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. The code assumes that `$tid` is an integer, but does not enforce this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** While initially a blind SQL injection, the application's error reporting configuration allowed the attacker to use error-based SQL injection to extract data. Specifically, the `extractvalue()` MySQL function was used to trigger error messages that revealed the query results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** An unauthenticated attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Administrator Account Compromise:** By exploiting the SQL injection, the attacker can retrieve a password reset token for the administrator account.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With admin access, the attacker can upload a PHP shell and execute arbitrary code on the web server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication through the `/Ajax/topic/:tid/:from/get_posts` route.
- **Manipulated Topic ID:** The attacker manipulates the `$tid` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **No Prior Knowledge or Privileges:** No prior knowledge of the system or privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `sys/CODOF/Forum/Topic.php` within the `get_topic_info()` function.
- The user-controlled `$tid` is directly embedded in the SQL query on line 462 and executed on line 464.
- The `extractvalue()` function was used with a crafted XPath query to extract data through error messages.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided text contains a demonstration video of how the vulnerability is exploited to extract a reset token and gain admin access.
- A patch was released by the vendor that casts `$tid` to integer.
