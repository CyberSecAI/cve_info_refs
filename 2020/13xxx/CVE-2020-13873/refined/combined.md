In the SonarSource R&D team we are equally driven by studying and understanding real-world vulnerabilities, then by helping the open-source community secure their projects. This recently led us to uncover and report multiple security vulnerabilities in Codoforum, an open source forum software developed in PHP. The vulnerabilities enable different attack vectors for a complete take over of any Codoforum board with version <4.9 and are rated as critical. No prior knowledge or privileges are required by a remote attacker. We reported all issues responsibly to the affected vendor who released a security patch immediately.

In this blog post we analyze the technical root cause of three vulnerabilities, what security measures were found and bypassed, and how to correctly prevent these in your code. We will look at the vulnerabilities from an attacker’s perspective and demonstrate how various exploitation techniques are used in an attack to sharpen your defender’s mindset.

## SQL Injection (CVE-2020-13873)

We found two SQL Injection vulnerabilities and one of these can be exploited as an unauthenticated forum user to extract data from the database. These allow an attacker to fully compromise an administrator account by retrieving a password reset token. Once an administrator account is accessed, the attacker can gain Remote Code Execution on the targeted web server and compromise the system’s host and data.

For demonstration purposes we’ve created a short video that shows the most critical SQL injection vulnerability and its impact.

### Technical Analysis

The vulnerability hides within the API call for fetching forum posts. Its code is defined in the *routes.php* file. Here, a dispatch function maps a route to a function that processes certain URL parameters. As shown in line 165, a topic ID `$tid (:tid)` is processed from the route that can be modified by a malicious user.

**routes.php**

```
165 function dispatch_get('Ajax/topic/:tid/:from/get_posts', function ($tid, $from) {
// ⋮
168    $topic = new \CODOF\Forum\Topic(\DB::getPDO());
169    $topic_info = $topic->get_topic_info($tid);
179 }
```

This route has neither CSRF protection nor a permission check and can be accessed from any visitor without authentication. The user input $tid is then passed to the get\_topic\_info() function without any sanitization.

In the `get_topic_info()` function, the user controlled variable `$tid` is concatenated directly into a SQL query in line 462 which is executed in line 464. This is a textbook SQL injection that allows an attacker to malform the SQL query in order to access other SQL tables and columns than intended. Erroneously, the developer assumed that the parameter `$tid` is an integer before it is included into the query as we can see from the comment in line 461.

**sys/CODOF/Forum/Topic.php**

```
458 public function get_topic_info($tid) {
⋮
461    // $tid is converted to integer so its safe
462    $qry = "SELECT t.redirect_to,t.topic_id,t.post_id, t.no_posts, t.no_views,t.uid," . "t.title, c.cat_name,t.post_id, c.cat_alias, c.cat_id," . "t.topic_created, t.topic_updated, t.topic_status " . "FROM codo_topics AS t " . "INNER JOIN codo_categories AS c ON c.cat_id=t.cat_id " . "WHERE t.topic_id=$tid AND t.topic_status<>0 LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0";
463
464    $res = $this->db->query($qry);
⋮
```

Although the SQL injection is easily triggered via the get\_posts route, the challenge for an attacker is that there is no access to the SQL query’s result (blind SQL injection). Worst-case, an attacker would need to extract data character by character by using timing techniques. However, there is the possibility to extract the result via an uncaught `PDOException` because error reporting is enabled by default in Codoforum. This requires less HTTP requests and the data can be extracted in chunks.

The MySQL function `extractvalue()` can be abused during a SQL injection attack for this purpose. It constructs an XPath query and checks for correct syntax. When we define a faulty XPath that includes information that we want to read, e.g. the MySQL version number, then this is leaked as part of the error message.

```
EXTRACTVALUE(RAND(),CONCAT(0x3a,(SELECT VERSION() LIMIT 0,1))
```

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8...)![]()![](https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95361965-6528-012b-61fc-b49456de9702/ad769000-3fcd-48dc-a5a1-c068e4100745/codoforum_leak.png.webp?w=943&h=362&auto=format&fit=crop)

With the help of this error-based technique, an attacker can extract data from the database quickly and efficiently. For example, the attacker could extract all passwords from the users table. This is very inefficient though because Codoforum stores only the hashes of all passwords using the bcrypt algorithm. The attacker would need to make the effort of cracking these hashes in order to login.

There is a more clever way. By requesting a password reset for a user, for example the forum’s administrator, a password reset token is generated and stored in the database. Although the attacker does not have access to the admin’s email to receive this token, he can now abuse the SQL injection to extract that token directly from the database. As a result, the attacker can reset the admin’s password with that token and then login as administrator. From here, the attacker can abuse administrator features to compromise the server as we will see in the last section of this post.

### Patch

By using prepared statements or an integer typecast it is prevented that an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL syntax and mix user input with the SQL query. This way, the attacker cannot modify the SQL query to its advantage anymore.

**sys/CODOF/Forum/Topic.php**

```
458  public function get_topic_info($tid) {
461     $tid = (int)$tid;
462     $qry = "SELECT t.redirect_to,t.topic_id,t.post_id, t.no_posts, t.no_views,t.uid," . "t.title, c.cat_name,t.post_id, c.cat_alias, c.cat_id," . "t.topic_created, t.topic_updated, t.topic_status " . "FROM codo_topics AS t " . "INNER JOIN codo_categories AS c ON c.cat_id=t.cat_id " . "WHERE t.topic_id=$tid AND t.topic_status<>0 LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0";
463
464     $res = $this->db->query($qry);
⋮
```

But there were alternative ways for an attacker to compromise the Codoforum board software.

## Path Traversal (CVE-2020-13874)

The second vulnerability type found was a Path Traversal that allows an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files from the server, such as sensitive configuration files. Although the developers tried to prevent this vulnerability with input sanitization, the filter could be bypassed. Let’s have a look at the details.

### Technical Details

The vulnerability resides in the file attachment feature of the forum. Via the route *serve/attachment* the `attachment()` function is called as shown in the code below. Here, in line 64, it calls the constructor `Serve()`. Note that there are several routes that lead to the vulnerable `Serve()` function and this route can be used as an unauthenticated user.

**routes.php**

```
62  dispatch_get('serve/attachment', function () {
63
64     $serve = new \Controller\Serve();
65     $serve->attachment();
66  });
```

We now inspect what happens in this `serve()` function. In line 37, a user controlled input `$_GET['path']` is retrieved and sanitized. It is concatenated with other strings and then used as a file path in line 42 to open a file that is offered for download. The whole security is based on the `sanitize()` function in line 37 which is supposed to prevent a path traversal attack.

**sys/Controller/Serve.php**

```
35  private function serve($path) {
36
37     $name = $this->sanitize($_GET['path']);
38     $dir = DATA_PATH . $path;
39
40     $path = $this->setBasicheaders($name, $dir);
41     header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $this->getRealFileName($name) . '"');
42     @readfile($path);
43     exit;
44  }
```

The following code listing shows the sanitization approach. In line 123, the characters `..` are removed and then the url encoded representation `%2e%2e` is also removed in the next line.

**sys/Controller/Serve.php**

```
121  private function sanitize($name) {
122
123     $name = str_replace("..", "", $name);
124     $name = str_replace("%2e%2e", "", $name);
125
126     return $name;
127  }
```

The problem is that the PHP function `str_replace()` does **not** replace the string recursively and is only processed once from left to right. This means that if the variable `$name` contains something like `/.%2e%2e./` it will be replaced back to `/../` and the sanitization is bypassed.

Thus a path traversal attack is possible and an unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the server by traversing in the file system and accessing sensitive files (`…/…/…/other/path/file`). This can lead to a full takeover of certain servers hosted with Codoforum.

The faulty sanitization can be fixed by first using `urldecode()` and then using `str_replace("..")` or by removing the second replacement altogether.

## Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2020-13876)

Last but not least, we uncovered a Persistent XSS vulnerability in Codoforum. It enables a low privileged, malicious user to inject a JavaScript payload into the admin backend. When an admin then visits an infected user profile, the XSS payload is executed and the attacker can perform any action as authenticated admin, including the execution of arbitrary code on the targeted web server.

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8...)![]()![](https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95361965-6528-012b-61fc-b49456de9702/efbdefc8-72f3-4e2e-9d69-e0f0042d468a/codeforum_xss.png.webp?w=1098&h=613&auto=format&fit=crop)

Let’s have a look at how this works. When registering a new user, we can specify an e-mail address which is then reflected in the admin backend. In the following code snippet, in line 679, the registration process is initialized.

**routes.php**

```
675  dispatch_post('/user/register', function () {
676
677     if (Request::valid($_POST['token'])) {
678        $user = new \Controller\user();
679        $user->register(true);
680
681        CODOF\Smarty\Layout::load($user->view, $user->css_files, $user->js_files);
682     }
683  });
```

The following code shows the simplified `register()` function. Here, in line 3, the user input `$_REQUEST['mail']` is retrieved and checked with other information in line 4. If there is no error, such as an invalid or already existing email address, the user will be registered.

**sys/Controller/user.php**

```
1  public function register($do) {
⋮
3     $register->mail = $_REQUEST['mail'];
4     $errors = $register->get_errors();
5
6     if (empty($errors)) {
7        //register user
8     }
⋮
```

For this purpose, the user controlled `$mail` variable is checked with the PHP built-in function `filter_var()` and its filter option `FILTER_VADLIDATE_EMAIL` in line 108. If `$mail` is a valid email and does not exist, the registration will work without problems (see above).

According to the PHP documentation, the `FILTER_VADLIDATE_EMAIL` generally validates the email address against the syntax defined in *RFC 822*. Hence, malicious HTML characters that can be used to construct a JavaScript payload can be used within an email address. Something like `"><script>alert(1)</script>x@foo.com` is valid and will not be rejected by the filter.

**sys/CODOF/Constraints/User.php**

```
105  public function mail($mail) {
106
107     $errors = array();
108     if (!filter_var($mail, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
109        $errors[] = _t("email address not formatted correctly");
110     }
111
112    if (\CODOF\User\User::mailExists($mail)) {
113       $errors[] = _t("email address is already registered");
114    }
115
116     $this->errors = array_merge($errors, $this->errors);
⋮
```

**admin/layout/templates/users/edit.tpl**

```
50  Email:<br>
51  <input type="text" name="email"  value="{$user.mail}" class="form-control" placeholder=""      required />
52  <br/>
```

Since Codoforum uses the PHP template engine Smarty, the escape modifier of Smarty can be used as a patch by replacing line 51 with the following content:

```
51  <input type="text" name="email"  value="{$user.mail|escape:'html'}" class="form-control" placeholder="" required />
```

If an admin visits the user profile to edit (block/delete) our registered user, the XSS payload is rendered in the admin’s web browser and we can perform any action as admin on the page. For example, administrator features can be abused to upload a PHP shell and to execute arbitrary code on the server. A [similar XSS issue](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/codoforum-software-patched-against-stored-xss-vulnerability "similar XSS issue") was found earlier that affected the user name.

As a result, an attacker can smuggle an XSS payload within the email address of a new user which is reflected unfiltered in the HTML response of the admin backend.

## Summary

In this blog post we analyzed three different security vulnerabilities in Codoforum, a popular board software. Each of these issues could lead to a complete takeover of the application. We’ve learned that a malicious user can take multiple paths when attacking an application and that finding only one single vulnerability is enough to fully compromise its security. Hence it is our task to make our applications as robust and secure as possible. Checking all user inputs properly and leveraging existing and proven sanitization and validation mechanisms is the first step towards a solid defense.

Due to the severity of the issues we’ve postponed the release of our blog post since the release of a fix in March. If you are hosting a Codoforum and didn’t update your installation yet, we highly recommend to do so now. Thanks to the Codoforum team, a patch version was quickly released after our reports.

Once an administrator account is accessed, the attacker can gain Remote Code Execution on the targeted web server and compromise the system’s host and data.

For demonstration purposes we’ve created a short video that shows the most critical SQL injection vulnerability and its impact.

[Codoforum 4.8.7: SQL Injection (CVE-2020-13873)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNjDkhfuGBo)

## Technical Analysis

The vulnerability hides in the API call for fetching forum posts. Its code is defined in file routes.php. Here, a dispatch function maps a route to a function that processes certain URL parameters. As shown in line 165, a topic ID `$tid (:tid)` is processed from the route that can be modified by a malicious user.

This route has neither CSRF protection nor a permission check and can be accessed from any visitor without authentication. The user input `$tid` is then passed to the `get_topic_info()` function without any sanitization.

**routes.php**

```

165 function dispatch_get('Ajax/topic/:tid/:from/get_posts', function ($tid, $from) {
⋮
168    $topic = new \CODOF\Forum\Topic(\DB::getPDO());
169    $topic_info = $topic->get_topic_info($tid);
179 }

```

In the `get_topic_info()` function, the user controlled variable `$tid` is concatenated directly into a SQL query in line 462 which is executed in line 464. This is a textbook SQL injection that allows an attacker to malform the SQL query in order to access other SQL tables and columns than intended. Erroneously, the developer assumed that the parameter `$tid` is an integer before it is included into the query as we can see from the comment in line 461.

**sys/CODOF/Forum/Topic.php**

```
458 public function get_topic_info($tid) {
⋮
461    // $tid is converted to integer so its safe
462    $qry = "SELECT t.redirect_to,t.topic_id,t.post_id, t.no_posts, t.no_views,t.uid," . "t.title, c.cat_name,t.post_id, c.cat_alias, c.cat_id," . "t.topic_created, t.topic_updated, t.topic_status " . "FROM codo_topics AS t " . "INNER JOIN codo_categories AS c ON c.cat_id=t.cat_id " . "WHERE t.topic_id=$tid AND t.topic_status<>0 LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0";
463
464    $res = $this->db->query($qry);
⋮

```

Although the SQL injection is easily triggered via the get\_posts route, the challenge for an attacker is that there is no access to the SQL query’s result (blind SQL injection). Worst-case, an attacker would need to extract data character by character by using timing techniques. However, there is the possibility to extract the result via an uncaught PDOException because error reporting is enabled by default in Codoforum. This requires less HTTP requests and the data can be extracted in chunks.

The MySQL function `extractvalue()` can be abused during a SQL injection attack for this purpose. It constructs an XPath query and checks for correct syntax. When we define a faulty XPath that includes information that we want to read, e.g. the MySQL version number, then this is leaked as part of the error message.

**`EXTRACTVALUE(RAND(),CONCAT(0x3a,(SELECT VERSION() LIMIT 0,1))`**

[![sqli](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/sonarsource/uploads/sonarcommunity/optimized/2X/b/b0a81d62a5622257e9d4e092a7cd3e9feabdf6f1_2_690x264.png)
sqli943×362 67.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/sonarsource/uploads/sonarcommunity/original/2X/b/b0a81d62a5622257e9d4e092a7cd3e9feabdf6f1.png "sqli")

With the help of this error-based technique, an attacker can extract data from the database quickly and efficiently. For example, the attacker could extract all passwords from the users table. This is very inefficient though because Codoforum stores only the hashes of all passwords using the bcrypt algorithm. The attacker would need to make the effort of cracking these hashes in order to login.

There is a more clever way. By requesting a password reset for a user, for example the forum’s administrator, a password reset token is generated and stored in the database. Although the attacker does not have access to the admin’s email to receive this token, he can now abuse the SQL injection to extract that token directly from the database. As a result, the attacker can reset the admin’s password with that token and then login as administrator. From here, the attacker can abuse administrator features to compromise the server as we will see in Part 3.

## Patch

By using prepared statements or an integer typecast it is prevented that an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL syntax and mix user input with the SQL query. This way, the attacker cannot modify the SQL query to its advantage anymore.

**sys/CODOF/Forum/Topic.php**

```
458 public function get_topic_info($tid) {
⋮
461    $tid = (int)$tid;
462    $qry = "SELECT t.redirect_to,t.topic_id,t.post_id, t.no_posts, t.no_views,t.uid," . "t.title, c.cat_name,t.post_id, c.cat_alias, c.cat_id," . "t.topic_created, t.topic_updated, t.topic_status " . "FROM codo_topics AS t " . "INNER JOIN codo_categories AS c ON c.cat_id=t.cat_id " . "WHERE t.topic_id=$tid AND t.topic_status<>0 LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0";
463
464    $res = $this->db->query($qry);
⋮

```

But there were alternative ways for an attacker to compromise the Codoforum board software.

# Path Traversal (CVE-2020-13874)

The second vulnerability type found was a Path Traversal that allows an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files from the server, such as sensitive configuration files. Although the developers tried to prevent this vulnerability with input sanitization, the filter could be bypassed. Let’s have a look at the details.

[![fd_codo](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/sonarsource/uploads/sonarcommunity/optimized/2X/2/28a727cf2cd8ef9fea8fcd826fcc168b9fd48a23_2_690x304.png)
fd\_codo930×410 75.6 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/sonarsource/uploads/sonarcommunity/original/2X/2/28a727cf2cd8ef9fea8fcd826fcc168b9fd48a23.png "fd_codo")

## Technical Details

The vulnerability resides in the file attachment feature of the forum. Via the route `serve/attachment` the `attachment()` function is called as shown in the code below. Here, in line 64, it calls the constructor `Serve()`. Note that there are several routes that lead to the vulnerable `Serve()` function and this route can be used as an unauthenticated user.

**routes.php**

```

62 dispatch_get('serve/attachment', function () {
63
64    $serve = new \Controller\Serve();
65    $serve->attachment();
66 });

```

We now inspect what happens in this `serve()` function. In line 37, a user controlled input `$_GET['path']` is retrieved and sanitized. It is concatenated with other strings and then used as a file path in line 42 to open a file that is offered for download. The whole security is based on the `sanitize()` function in line 37 which is supposed to prevent a path traversal attack.

**sys/Controller/Serve.php**

```
35 private function serve($path) {
36
37    $name = $this->sanitize($_GET['path']);
38    $dir = DATA_PATH . $path;
39
40    $path = $this->setBasicheaders($name, $dir);
41    header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $this->getRealFileName($name) . '"');
42    @readfile($path);
43    exit;
44 }

```

The following code listing shows the sanitization approach. In line 123, the characters `..` are removed and then the url encoded representation %2e%2e is also removed in the next line.

**sys/Controller/Serve.php**

```
121 private function sanitize($name) {
122
123    $name = str_replace("..", "", $name);
124    $name = str_replace("%2e%2e", "", $name);
125
126    return $name;
127 }

```

The problem is that the PHP function `str_replace()` does **not** replace the string recursively and is only processed once from left to right. This means that if the variable `$name` contains something like `/.%2e%2e./` the sanitization is insufficient.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before | After | Line |
| /.%2e%2e./ | /.%2e%2e./ | 123 |
| /.%2e%2e./ | /…/ | 124 |

Thus a path traversal attack is possible and an unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the server by traversing in the file system and accessing sensitive files (…/…/…/other/path/file). This can lead to a full takeover of certain servers hosted with Codoforum.

The faulty sanitization can be fixed by first using `urldecode()` and then using `str_replace("..")` or by removing the second replacement altogether.

# Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2020-13876)

Last but not least, we uncovered Persistent XSS vulnerability in Codoforum. It enables a low privileged, malicious user to inject a JavaScript payload into the admin backend. When an admin then visits an infected user profile, the XSS payload is executed and the attacker can perform any action as authenticated admin, including the execution of arbitrary code on the targeted web server.

[![xss_codo](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/sonarsource/uploads/sonarcommunity/optimized/2X/8/84b9d2a9557883f90816b1c01bb4e4debf782c2c_2_690x385.png)
xss\_codo1098×613 23.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/sonarsource/uploads/sonarcommunity/original/2X/8/84b9d2a9557883f90816b1c01bb4e4debf782c2c.png "xss_codo")

Let’s have a look at how this works. When registering a new user, we can specify an e-mail address which is then reflected in the admin backend. In the following code snippet, in line 679, the registration process is initialized.

**routes.php**

```
675  dispatch_post('/user/register', function () {
676
677     if (Request::valid($_POST['token'])) {
678         $user = new \Controller\user();
679         $user->register(true);
680
681         CODOF\Smarty\Layout::load($user->view, $user->css_files, $user->js_files);
682     }
683  });

```

The following code shows the simplified `register()` function. Here, in line 3, the user input `$_REQUEST['mail']` is retrieved and checked with other information in line 4. If there is no error, such as an invalid or already existing email address, the user will be registered.

**sys/Controller/user.php**

```
1 public function register($do) {
⋮
3    $register->mail = $_REQUEST['mail'];
4    $errors = $register->get_errors();
5
6    if (empty($errors)) {
7       //register user
8    }
⋮

```

For this purpose, the user controlled `$mail` variable is checked with the PHP built-in function `filter_var()` and its filter option `FILTER_VADLIDATE_EMAIL` in line 108. If `$mail` is a valid email and does not exist, the registration will work without problems (see above).

According to the PHP documentation, the `FILTER_VADLIDATE_EMAIL` generally validates the email address against the syntax defined in *RFC 822*. Hence, malicious HTML characters that can be used to construct a JavaScript payload can be used within an email address. Something like `"><script>alert(1)</script>x@foo.com` is valid and will not be rejected by the filter.

**sys/CODOF/Constraints/User.php**

```
105 public function mail($mail) {
106
107    $errors = array();
108    if (!filter_var($mail, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
109       $errors[] = _t("email address not formatted correctly");
110    }
111
112    if (\CODOF\User\User::mailExists($mail)) {
113       $errors[] = _t("email address is already registered");
114    }
115
116    $this->errors = array_merge($errors, $this->errors);
⋮

```

**admin/layout/templates/users/edit.tpl**

```
50 Email:<br>
51 <input type="text" name="email" value="{$user.mail}" class="form-control" placeholder="" required />
52 <br/>

```

Since CODOFORUM uses the PHP template engine smarty, the escape modifier of smarty can be used as a patch by replacing line 51 with the following content:

```
51 <input type="text" name="email" value="{$user.mail|escape:'html'}" class="form-control" placeholder="" required />

```

If an admin looks at the user profile to edit (block/delete) our registered user, the XSS payload is rendered in the admin’s web browser and we can perform any action as admin on the page. For example, administrator features can be abused to upload a PHP shell and to execute arbitrary code on the server. A [similar XSS issue](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/codoforum-software-patched-against-stored-xss-vulnerability) was found earlier that affected the user name.

As a result, an attacker can smuggle an XSS payload within the email address of a new user, which is reflected unfiltered in the HTML response of the admin backend.

# Summary

In this story we analyzed three different security vulnerabilities in Codoforum, a popular board software. Each of these issues could lead to a complete takeover of the application. We’ve learned that a malicious user can take multiple paths when attacking an application and that finding only one single vulnerability is enough to fully compromise its security. Hence it is our task to make our applications as robust and secure as possible. Checking all user inputs properly and leveraging existing and proven sanitization and validation mechanisms is the first step towards a solid defense.

Due to the severity of the issues we’ve postponed the release of our story since the release of a fix in March. If you are hosting a Codoforum and didn’t update your installation yet, we highly recommend to do so now. Thanks to the Codoforum team, a patch version was quickly released after our reports.

* On my site only registered users can create post and reply. Now I want to make a category where anyone, even if not registered, can create a post and reply. In that case, I create a category and assign permissions to all users to create new topics, in particular to the guest user.When an unregistered user ( guest ) enters the category, the "New Topic" button appears correctly.

[Looking for Guidance on Customising Codoforum to Increase User Engagement](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/14485/looking-for-guidance-on-customising-codoforum-to-increase-user-engagement)

Hello Everyone,

I'm utilising right now to create an online community for a project, and I'd appreciate some tips on how to increase user involvement through customisation. The forum functions flawlessly, however I believe there is still room for improvement in terms of user interaction and aesthetic appeal.

In particular, I'm curious about:

Customising the Theme: Is there a way to change the default forum layout, colour scheme, or typography? Are there any themes or tools that would improve appearance without compromising functionality?

Features of User Interactivity: I've noticed that a lot of well-known forums have leaderboards, achievements, and medal systems. Are these kinds of gamification elements supported by Codoforum, and if so, how can I use them? If not, is it possible to include outside programs to include these features?

What are some best practices for search engine optimisation on Codoforum? Does my forum have to have a certain plugin installed or configuration to rank higher in search results?

Security and Spam Prevention: Although the built-in security protections are useful, I'm wondering if there are any more actions or plugins that could assist protect the forum from spammers and unsolicited messages in particular.

Your suggestions or success stories about increasing [mendix](https://www.igmguru.com/digital-marketing-programming/mendix-training "www.igmguru.com ") user engagement and personalisation would be much appreciated. Any advice, sources, or samples would be greatly valued!

Thank you in advance.

Hi again, it's been a while.

I was looking around and had a question. Is it possible to have the server send a webhook request, or a few, when someone makes a new topic, and change each request by category (such as posting in a category called 'games' will send one webhook but a post in a category called 'internal' would not.

Hello, all!

This is my first post after just joining this discussion, so please forgive me and provide kind assistance if I have posted to the wrong subsection!

I am new here but a real enthusiast and loving this community so far. I have a background in teaching coding and in education and feel I could help with documentation, at least for starters.

As a new member in this forum and wish to share and gain some knowledge. I am looking forward to create my own discussion to resolve my query and gain some knowledge though I have taken part in various discussion which is definitely helped me a lot.

Also in what category should be taken depends on what factors?

Thank you in advance.

I'm creating a new thread so as not to hijack someone Else's thread. When visitors access my website they are greeted by the infamous blue box. I'm sure it has something to do with the group chat. I have disabled group chat for visitors and only logged in members can use it (using the ACL) . Logged in members do not get the blue box and are able to use it just fine. I'm currently running the following:

Joomla 3.4.5
Freichat 10
Freichat Plugin v7
php 5.5.22
MySql 5.5.43
Community Builder 2.0.12

I have used both basic and silver themes and the problem persists with both. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

Can we, in Freichat, see as an Administrator users chat history? For example Seeing the last two days chat...

Also, Can Freichat automatically delete old chat messages? For example, deleting all messages older than 5 days... Or do we have to do it manually?

Thank you

## Hello community,

I have been a volunteer moderator here for many years, helping the Codoloic team in the forum.

### What's going on right now:

As you have noticed, the development of **Codoforum** and **also the support** in the forum have been somewhat limited, or rather, **have come to a standstill** for the time being.
This is for **private reasons**, but the **Codologic team will get back to it**, so you can certainly hope that everything will return to normal - however, **I cannot give you a time frame for this**. Everyone has **good and bad times in life, so please take this into account**.

**Here you can read more avout the topic:**

### Do NOT spam and write in ENGLISH please:

Another important topic is **spam here and language**. **Anyone who leaves spam here will have their topic deleted** in any case, and **if they violate this again, their account will be banned forever**!

So please **refrain from spamming** and **the language in the forum is only ENGLISH**.

 **Thank you very much and best regards**.

Your moderator, WebCrew ![smile](https://codologic.com:443/forum/sites/default/assets/img/smileys/cool.gif)

Hi!

Is Codoforum still being developed? The forum looks abandoned / unmoderated, the code base not maintained for quite a while (including open CVEs).

I'm looking for a (support) forum to be integrated into my app's landing page, and Codoforum seems to tick all boxes - but I don't want to flog a dead horse...

My install uses SSO connected to a WordPress website.

After restoring to a backup of the files and database from a day earlier, site SSO not working, there are two Warnings, the site CSS is obviously not loading. Wondering how to solve this. Any help appreciated.

Warning: file\_put\_contents(/.../cache/css/5ebdc806ce4da3ce174874d104fba209.css): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /.../sys/CODOF/Asset/Stream.php on line 265

I have been told that the restored backup of the files did not include the cache, which makes sense why I am seeing those Warnings. So is there a way to generate new cache files? Would that likely get this back up and running?

Can someone reach out to Malwarebytes as Malwarebytes web protection is detecting codoforum.com as malicious/hijacked domain.

Any user who uses our forums who uses Malwarebytes gets constant warnings from Malwarebytes due to codoforum getting stuff from the domain.

Hallo [@adesh](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/adesh "adesh") and [@admin](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/admin "admin")

I usually don't write any suggestions or only very rarely. The fact that I enjoy working here as a volunteer (as far as I can) gave me the following idea:

It would be a great feature if it could be possible to create some kind of "article templates" in the admin backend.

What I mean by that is that it allows you to create a fixed template structure for forum posts, for example:

1. for tutorials
2. support requests
3. or reviews
4. etc.

That would simply be an ingenious feature to bring more order and, of course, a nicer structure to a forum, for which it would be clearer and more uniform.
Furthermore, I think it would give Codoforum a good advantage over most other forum software since the feature is very rare.

**What do you think of it - would this be feasible and would you want to tackle it?**

Kind regards and thx for your awesome work.

Hallo [@admin](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/admin "admin") and [@adesh](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/adesh "adesh")

I would have thought of something **small that could perhaps be integrated with little effort**.

You know **my dark theme here in the community**. How would it be **to use this as a kind of day/night theme**?

All that would be necessary would be two links in the user menu with **one link pointing to the Codoforum standard theme** (i.e. light design / day mode) and you could **add my theme to the system as a theme and use it as a dark theme** via a link. So all you have to do is integrate these two links into the user menu **and the theme chosen by the user is then stored in the browser cookie**. Bingo ready is the Codoforum Day/Night Mode ![smile](https://codologic.com:443/forum/sites/default/assets/img/smileys/smile.gif)

That would be a little thing that many would be happy about and **for me it's ok if you use my theme for it**.

Codoforum gives the right to self-host forums if you opt for the free plan. (All forum features cannot remove Powered by) ([source](http://codoforum.com/buy "source")).

As someone who self-hosts an install of Codoforum myself (Configured an Ubunutu Server myself, setup web server, maintenance, security) I also have to configure the content security policies. And if Codoforum gave a list domains to add to the list so Codoforum works without issue then it'd remove the headache of figuring out which some features do not work (as example from above, the badges not working if [https://unpkg.com/vue@next](https://unpkg.com/vue%40next "https://unpkg.com/vue@next") is not whitelisted, Freichat not working if [https://nodelb.freichat.com](https://nodelb.freichat.com "https://nodelb.freichat.com") also is not whitelisted, and so on.

[https://unpkg.com/vue@next](https://unpkg.com/vue%40next "unpkg.com ")

Hey PHP developers! We’re a team of passionate PHP users, and we’ve launched a free PHP vulnerability scanner. It detects SQL injections, XSS, command injections, and more.

We’re in beta, and it would be extremely helpful to get feedback from a more professional audience. Please check it here -

We’re looking for any tips, wishes, or constructive criticism you could offer. Thank you!

Hello folks,
I found this forum just amazing!

In my forum I needed a like button. I did not found anything looking around, so I decided to write it by my own.

I downloaded Codoforum just yesterday so it is my very first plugin, fell free to use it and contribute it ![smile](http://codologic.com/forum/sites/default/assets/img/smileys/smile.gif)

## Issues

* Post drafts does not save entered polls
* Browser push notifcations does not seem to work
* When a user is modifying their bio, it adds the HTML code `<p></p>` to it
* When a user is modifying their profile and goes under "preferences" it does not show if `Show real-time notifications` or `Show desktop notifications` is enabled.
* When a user clicks on the search bar at the top it auto-jumps up to the top of the forum when scrolling
* When in the admin dashboard and the user enables "Spam Filter" it changes but refreshes and it shows as if it did not change until the user reloads the page

## Suggestions

* A way to prevent guests from voting twice on a poll if logged out (ex. IP)
* Use more gender-neutral language during UI elements (ex. polls saying "Can user recast his vote?" (Not major, just more professional language)

Just some things i've noticed playing around with Codo, cheers

Hey [@admin](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/admin "admin") it's me again. Hope you're doing great!

Man, I got 2 more problems.

1. I can't happen to Add or Show Pagination in Tags pages. You see, it's not there by default. And I tried to write my own codes but that didn't work.
2. Stuffs don't show up for Specify Pages. When I put just 1 path, it works fine. But when I put multiple paths (one per line) it doesn't work at all.

posted May 20 '22 at 12:22 am

I'm creating a forum related to a particular, but broad topic, and it needs to have the following specific features:

-the ability to follow individual users and have all their posts AND COMMENTS show up in your main feed.

-the ability to upload/download documents as a post that can be commented under like any other post. (It would also be great if it could somehow be displayed in the post, but that's not essential).

-the ability to search for the document posts based on specific keywords. Not a global site search, but searching within the "documents" sub itself.

-the ability to create private subs.

If anyone could tell me if codologic has those features, that would be great. Thanks!

Login Form

```

          <div class="form-label-group">
            <input type="text" name="user" id="user" class="form-control" placeholder="User ID" required>

            <label for="pass">Password</label>
          </div>
          <p>logins are automatically remembered for 60 days. use the <a href="signout.php">signout</a> page to sign out. </p>
