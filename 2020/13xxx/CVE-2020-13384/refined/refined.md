Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload functionality within the Monstra CMS. The application does not properly validate the type of uploaded file and allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application lacks proper input validation and allows uploading files with potentially dangerous extensions (in this case, `.php7`).
- Lack of file type validation: The system fails to check and restrict the type of files being uploaded, leading to the possibility of executing malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successfully exploited, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control of the system and potentially sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web Interface: The vulnerability is accessed through the web interface of the CMS, specifically the file manager section.
- HTTP POST Request: The exploit involves crafting a specific HTTP POST request with a malicious payload (PHP code) as the file content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Monstra CMS with access to the file manager.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Monstra CMS server to send malicious requests.
- Understanding of HTTP: The attacker needs to craft HTTP requests and understand file uploads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses the `.php7` extension, which suggests it is specifically targeting servers that support PHP7.
- The provided exploit code includes a basic shell which allows the attacker to execute system commands through `?cmd=`.
- The provided exploit is specific to version 3.0.4 of the CMS.
- The content provides a detailed example of the HTTP request needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Although the exploit uses `shell.php7` for the exploit, the content indicates that the file extension can be anything, allowing the attacker to potentially bypass basic file type filtering.
- The content does not reference a CVE ID, however, the exploit report relates to CVE-2020-13384 based on the vendor and version.
