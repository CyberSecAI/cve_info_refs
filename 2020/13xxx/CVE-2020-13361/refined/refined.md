Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-13361:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `es1370_transfer_audio` function within the `hw/audio/es1370.c` file in QEMU. This function doesn't properly validate the frame count provided by a guest OS.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Access:** The lack of proper frame count validation allows a guest OS user to trigger an out-of-bounds access during an `es1370_write()` operation. Specifically, a crafted `frame_cnt` value can lead to incorrect calculations, making the `size` variable smaller than the `cnt` variable and resulting in an out-of-bounds read during audio data processing (`audio_pcm_sw_read`).
*   The frame count itself is derived from user provided data. The `frame_cnt` value is split in two with bitwise operations to provide the `size` and `cnt` variables used in the vulnerability.
    ```c
        int cnt = d->frame_cnt >> 16;
        int size = d->frame_cnt & 0xffff;
    ```

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. A successful exploit can crash the QEMU process on the host, rendering the virtual machine unavailable.
*   **Possible Information Disclosure**: One source mentions the possibility of information disclosure, but does not elaborate on how beyond leaking host memory.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest OS User:** The attack vector involves a malicious user or process within the guest operating system.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Access within Guest:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges within the guest OS to control the frame count being passed into the vulnerable function.
*   **Ability to interact with the vulnerable code:** The attacker must be able to use the emulated hardware in the QEMU virtual machine to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to execute code within the guest OS.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs because the code does not check if the total frame count (`size`) is greater than the number of frames already processed (`cnt`). If `size` is less than `cnt`, calculations lead to out-of-bounds access.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered during both ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) channel operations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `size` is not less than `cnt` before proceeding with calculations in `es1370_transfer_audio`. This avoids the out-of-bounds access.
*   The vulnerability affects QEMU versions 5.0.0 and earlier.
*   Upstream patches and various distribution-specific security advisories (e.g., Debian DLA/DSA, Ubuntu USN, SUSE security advisories) are available to address this flaw.
*  The CVSS v3 score for this issue ranges from 3.9 to 5.5 depending on the source.
*   Multiple security teams at universities and other organizations are credited with discovering the vulnerability.

This vulnerability is a relatively straightforward out-of-bounds read issue, that can lead to a denial-of-service when triggered by a malicious guest OS process.
