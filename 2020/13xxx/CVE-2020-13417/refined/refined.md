The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2020-13417.

**CVE-2020-13417**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Aviatrix VPN client on Linux, macOS, and Windows is vulnerable to an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability. The vulnerability was previously reported as CVE-2020-7224, and a patch was released but the fix was incomplete. This incomplete fix allowed for dangerous OpenSSL parameters that are not authorized, to be executed.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Elevation of Privilege due to incomplete fix in OpenVPN client. Vulnerable to OpenSSL parameter alteration.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**: Unauthorized code execution due to OpenSSL parameters not being properly validated.

*   **Attack Vectors**: By altering OpenSSL parameters, an attacker could potentially load unauthorized third-party libraries and achieve code execution, leading to elevation of privilege. This affects Linux, macOS, and Windows clients.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker would need the ability to alter OpenSSL parameters during the connection process.

This entry provides more detail than a typical CVE description, by specifying the root cause of the vulnerability being an incomplete fix from a previous CVE, and describing the attack vector of OpenSSL parameter alteration, and the resulting impact of arbitrary code execution.
