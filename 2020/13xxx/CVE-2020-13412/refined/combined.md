# PSIRT Advisories

Aviatrix Product Security Team continually tests the software product, looking for vulnerabilities and weaknesses. If you have a security issue to report, please open a support ticket at Aviatrix Support Portal at <https://support.aviatrix.com>. Any such findings are fed back to Aviatrix's development teams and serious issues are described along with protective solutions in the advisories below.

Please note the below Aviatrix Security recommendations and communication plans:
- Aviatrix strongly recommend customers to stay on the latest release to resolve features and bug issues. All fixes are in the new release; we do not patch older release versions.
- Customers are strongly recommended to perform image migration 2x a year. The migration process provides the latest system level security patch
- All known software vulerabilities are submitted to Mitre for CVE-ID references by Aviatrix Systems
- Avitrix publish Field Notices and send alerts to Controller Admin in the Controller console when security related issues are published

## Most Recent IR

### 20. Aviatrix Controller and Gateways - Privilege Escalation (CVE-2021-4034 and CVE-2022-0185)

**Date** 02/03/2022

**Risk Rating** Medium

**Description** The publicly disclosed CVE-2021-4034 and CVE-2022-0185 are local privilege escalation vulnerabilities disclosed in the past two weeks.
When successfully executed, an attack exploiting these vulnerabilities can cause a local privilege escalation giving unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine. The Aviatrix Gateway, Controller, and Copilot are all running vulnerable versions of the Linux packages.
However, in order to successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker requires local access to our systems and no vulnerability known to us today would allow such attack.

**Impact** A local user to our appliances can escalate his privileges to root.

**Affected Products** Aviatrix Controller and Gateways.

**Solution**

* Upgrade Copilot to Release 1.6.3.
* Apply security patch [AVI-2022-0001 - CVE-2021-4034 and CVE-2022-0185 Privilege Escalation Patches] to controllers.

### 19. Aviatrix Controller and Gateways - Unauthorized Access

**Date** 01/11/2022

**Risk Rating** High for Gateways, medium for Controller.

**Description** On the Aviatrix Controller, a successful attack would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker partial access to configuration information and allow them to disrupt the service. On the gateway, a successful attack would allow an unauthenticated network-adjacent attacker (i.e.: an attacker present on the gateway's VPC) access to its API.

**Impact** Access to configuration information and disruption of service.

**Affected Products** Aviatrix Controller, Gateways and Copilot.

**Solution** Upgrade your controller and gateway software to:

* 6.4.2995 or later.
* 6.5.2898 or later.

### 18. Aviatrix Controller - Remote file execution

**Date**
10/04/2021

**Risk Rating**
Critical

**Description**
The Aviatrix Controller legacy API had a vulnerability allowing an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files, including .php scripts, to the filesystem. These uploaded scripts will be processed by the web frontend, allowing an attacker to run code of their choosing.

**Impact**
Remote file execution

**Affected Product**
Aviatrix Controller prior to the fixed versions.

**Solution**
The vulnerability has been fixed in:

> * UserConnect-6.2-1804.2043 or later
> * UserConnect-6.3-1804.2490 or later
> * UserConnect-6.4-1804.2838 or later
