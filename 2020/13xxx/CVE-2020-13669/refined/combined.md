# Drupal core - Moderately critical - Cross-site scripting - SA-CORE-2020-010

Project: [Drupal core](/project/drupal)Date: 2020-September-16Security risk: [**Moderately critical** 13 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:User/CI:Some/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:Default](/security-team/risk-levels "AC - Access complexity: Basic or routine (user must follow specific path)
A - Authentication: User-level access (basic/commonly assigned permissions)
CI - Confidentiality impact: Certain non-public data is released
II - Integrity impact: Some data can be modified
E - Exploit (Zero-day impact): Theoretical or white-hat (no public exploit code or documentation on development exists)
TD - Target distribution: Default or common module configurations are exploitable, but a config change can disable the exploit")Vulnerability: Cross-site scriptingAffected versions: >= 8.0.0 <8.8.10 || >= 8.9.0 <8.9.6 || >=9.0.0 <9.0.6CVE IDs: CVE-2020-13669Description:

Drupal core's built-in CKEditor image caption functionality is vulnerable to XSS.

Solution:

Install the latest version:

* If you are using Drupal 8.8.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.8.10](/project/drupal/releases/8.8.10).
* If you are using Drupal 8.9.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.9.6](/project/drupal/releases/8.9.6).
* If you are using Drupal 9.0.x, upgrade to [Drupal 9.0.6](/project/drupal/releases/9.0.6).

Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.8.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage. Sites on 8.7.x or earlier should update to 8.8.10.
