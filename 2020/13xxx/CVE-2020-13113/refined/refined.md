Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13113:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of uninitialized memory within the EXIF MakerNote handling of the `libexif` library. Specifically, when parsing MakerNote data, the library did not initialize data pointers before potentially dereferencing them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use of Uninitialized Memory:** The primary weakness is that the library was using memory without properly initializing it.
- **Potential Use-After-Free:** The uninitialized memory could lead to a use-after-free condition if the memory is freed and then accessed again.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crashes:** The primary impact is that the vulnerability can cause the application to crash, leading to denial of service.
- **Potential Use-After-Free:** While not confirmed, a use-after-free condition is possible, which can lead to more serious exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious EXIF file that triggers the vulnerable code path within libexif's MakerNote handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to supply a specially crafted EXIF image file to an application or service that uses the vulnerable `libexif` library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that MakerNote data pointers are initialized to NULL before being dereferenced.
- The affected code resides within `exif-mnote-data-canon.c`, `exif-mnote-data-fuji.c`, `exif-mnote-data-olympus.c`, and `exif-mnote-data-pentax.c` files within libexif.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity.
- The vulnerability affects libexif versions before 0.6.22.
