Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the HackerOne report, which corresponds to CVE-2020-13316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy between the documented behavior of GitLab's "Disable Repository functionality" setting and its actual implementation when deploy tokens are involved. While disabling the repository is intended to prevent access to project files, it fails to block access via deploy tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Access Control:** The "Disable Repository functionality" setting does not apply to deploy tokens, creating an inconsistency in how access is controlled.
*   **Bypass of Intended Security Measure:** The documentation states that disabling the repository should also disable related features, such as container registry and access to project files. However, deploy tokens bypass this intended restriction.
*   **Lack of Granular Control:**  There is a lack of granular control over deploy token permissions, which allows the tokens to override the disabled repository functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Project Files:** An attacker with a valid deploy token can clone the project repository, even if the repository functionality is disabled by the project owner.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Container Registry:**  An attacker can pull and push container registry images even with the repository disabled.
*   **Potential Data Breach:** This can lead to a data breach if a deploy token is compromised, or when an owner disables the repository functionality as a countermeasure after losing a deploy token.
*   **Circumvention of Security Measures:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass a security measure that project owners might rely on to protect their data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Deploy Token Compromise:** An attacker gains access to a project's deploy token through various means (e.g., phishing, social engineering, token exposure).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Deploy Token:** The attacker must possess a valid deploy token for the targeted GitLab project.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the GitLab instance.
