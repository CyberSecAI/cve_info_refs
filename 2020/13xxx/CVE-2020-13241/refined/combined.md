|  | Product Version: 1.1.18 |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability: Unrestricted File Upload |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | Description: |
|  | The Microweber 1.1.18 application is vulnerable to unrestricted file uploads. Effective controls have not been implemented to restrict users from uploading malicious content to the web server. Files containing code like .php, .exe and etc can be uploaded successfully. |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Type: Local |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: |
|  | Unrestricted file upload is a serious vulnerability with significant impact on the application and its infrastructure. An attacker with the ability to upload a malicious file to the application can be used to gain access to the file system through a web shell. |
|  |  |
|  | Client-side attacks: Uploading malicious files can make the website vulnerable to client-side attacks such as XSS or Cross-site. |
|  |  |
|  | An attacker might be able to put a phishing page into the website or deface the website. |
|  |  |
|  | Steps: |
|  |  |
|  | 1. Login into your Microweber account |
|  | 2. Go to admin page |
|  | 3. Go to Users -> My Profile -> Edit User |
|  | 4. Try to Upload any image extension. It will successfully update. |
|  | 5. Now, download any web shell from google and modify the extension. |
|  | 6. capture the request of upload profile in burp and modify image extension (Eg- test.php.png) |
|  | 7. It will succesfully upload the web shell. |
