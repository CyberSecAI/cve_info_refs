Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13968:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `strSessao` parameter in HTTP requests. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL statements against the application's database. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
- Data exfiltration: Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database.
- Data manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- Privilege escalation: Attackers might be able to gain administrative access to the database or the application.
- Denial of service: Attackers may be able to disrupt the application's availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the application. The `strSessao` parameter within the URL is the point of injection. Any path is vulnerable with the presence of this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required, as it's an unauthenticated vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerable application is "CRK Business Platform" versions <= 2019.1.
- The vulnerability is exploitable on any path where the `strSessao` parameter is used.
- The provided Nmap NSE script `http-vuln-cve2020-13968.nse` attempts to exploit the vulnerability by injecting a single quote `'` into the `strSessao` parameter and checking for an "Invalid object name" error in the response, indicating SQL injection is possible.
- The Nmap script defines a list of ports to scan, which includes common web ports.
- The script includes a reference to the CVE on MITRE.
