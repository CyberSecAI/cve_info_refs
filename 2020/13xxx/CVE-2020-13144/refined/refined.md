Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-13144:

**It is important to note that while the provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in OpenEDX, it does not explicitly state that this RCE is associated with CVE-2020-13144. Therefore, a definitive determination cannot be made with the information given. However, this analysis assumes the RCE described in the Stark0de article is related to CVE-2020-13144 for analysis purposes.**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject and execute arbitrary Python code within a "Custom Python-Evaluated problem" in the OpenEDX platform. This occurs because the platform, by default, does not properly sandbox the Python code, allowing it to interact with the underlying operating system.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: The core weakness is the lack of proper sandboxing or input validation for custom Python code in problem definitions, allowing execution of arbitrary OS commands via `os.system()`.
    *   **Lack of Default Mitigation**: The mitigation, CodeJail, is not enabled by default, leaving vulnerable installations exposed.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the OpenEDX platform with the privileges of the user running the OpenEDX instance. In the given example, the attacker is able to write to a file using  `cat /etc/passwd > /tmp/test_rce`
    *   **Complete System Compromise**: This could lead to complete control of the server, data theft, or further attacks on connected systems.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Malicious Problem Definition**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious custom Python-evaluated problem within the OpenEDX Studio. This is done via the following steps:
        1.  Create an account on the OpenEDX platform.
        2.  Go to the Studio.
        3.  Create a Course.
        4.  Create a Unit in the course.
        5.  Add a Problem.
        6.  Choose "Custom Python-Evaluated problem".
        7.  Insert the malicious python code (e.g., using `os.system()`).
        8.  Click the Submit button to execute the code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Authenticated User**: The attacker needs to have an account on the OpenEDX platform and be able to access the Studio, which is typically an administrative or instructor-level access.
    *   **Knowledge of OpenEDX**: The attacker needs to know the OpenEDX platform and its functionalities to navigate to the problem creation interface.
    *   **Basic Python Knowledge**: The attacker needs to have some understanding of python to inject commands within a python script tag.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text also mentions other vulnerabilities (stored XSS, CSV injection), but these are outside the scope of this specific RCE analysis and potential CVE-2020-13144.
*   The content provides more specific details than a typical CVE description, such as the exact method for exploitation using a python custom response with `os.system`.
*   The content also mentions a recommended mitigation, CodeJail, which is not enabled by default, indicating a configuration issue rather than an explicit flaw in the code that would typically be found in the CVE description.
* The inclusion of screenshots and a GIF in the Stark0de article provides a more concrete understanding of how the exploit is executed.
