Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-13168

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The `accountid` parameter in the `ForgotPassword.jsp` page is vulnerable.
- User-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being reflected in the HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input sanitization or encoding.
- Insufficient XSS protection mechanism. The attempt to mitigate XSS by filtering `<` characters was bypassed with a different payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious activities including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious site
    - Other malicious activities within the context of the user's session

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a crafted URL with the malicious payload injected into the `accountid` parameter of `ForgotPassword.jsp`.
- The victim needs to click on the malicious URL or have it loaded in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into accessing the malicious URL.
- No special privileges on the server or application are required.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered on March 5, 2020.
- The affected versions are 20.1.11b26 and prior.
- The vendor attempted to mitigate the issue with a "<" character filter which was insufficient.
- A modified payload using `'+%2B+alert('xss')+%2B+'` bypassed the vendor's mitigation.
