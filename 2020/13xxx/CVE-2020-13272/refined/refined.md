Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is that GitLab's OAuth implementation doesn't verify a user's email address before granting authorization via the OAuth2 Web application flow. This means that a user can create an account with a non-verified (potentially fake) email address and still obtain an authorization code through OAuth.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Email Verification in OAuth Flow:** The primary vulnerability is that GitLab's OAuth implementation does not check if the user's email is verified before issuing an authorization code. This deviates from the expected behavior of many other OAuth providers.
*   **Trusting Unverified Users:** GitLab's OAuth implementation essentially trusts that a user is legitimate and valid based solely on account creation, even before the associated email has been verified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Web Applications:** The primary impact is on web applications that rely on GitLab as an OAuth provider. If these applications assume that a user's GitLab account is tied to a verified email, they could be vulnerable to account hijacking or other forms of abuse. Specifically, an attacker could register an account using an email address that is not theirs (e.g., `tim@apple.com`) and then use OAuth to authenticate in a third-party app that trusts the email address from GitLab.
*   **Account Hijacking:** In web applications where social logins are linked with email/password based accounts, an attacker could register with a fake email address on GitLab, use the OAuth flow to authenticate on a 3rd-party app, and potentially hijack another user's account on that 3rd-party app.
*   **Social Authentication Abuse:** By returning a possibly fake email address with scope=read_user+profile, GitLab's OAuth could cause 3rd-party applications to believe the user is real and valid, potentially leading to abuse of these web applications' functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **OAuth Web Application Flow:** The attack vector is the standard OAuth2 Web application flow. An attacker begins this flow in a 3rd-party application which relies on GitLab as an OAuth provider.
*   **Unverified Email Account Registration:** The attacker needs to create a GitLab account with an arbitrary email, which doesn't have to be verified, in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create GitLab Account:** The attacker must be able to create a GitLab account with a possibly fake email address.
*   **Access to an OAuth Client Application:** The attacker must use a 3rd party application that uses GitLab as an OAuth provider and initiates an OAuth web application flow.
*   **No Special Network Access:**  The attacker does not require any special network access or insider privileges.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

*   The report highlights that other OAuth providers like GitHub fail OAuth flows when a user's email is not verified.
*   The issue affects all OAuth clients that trust GitLab as a social authentication provider.
*   The vulnerability was found on gitlab.com and is reproducible on the latest versions.
*   The report includes screenshots and logs of the successful Oauth flow with a non verified email account.
