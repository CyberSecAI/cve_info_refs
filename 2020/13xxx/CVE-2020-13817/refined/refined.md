      "root cause": "ntpd uses predictable transmit timestamps when relying on unauthenticated IPv4 time sources.",

        "ntpd transmits sub-second timestamps with limited randomness, making them predictable for attackers.",
        "Rescheduling of transmissions occurs even when a packet lacks a valid origin timestamp."
