- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the File module, which allows an attacker to access the file metadata of a permanent private file they don't have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to a lack of proper access control on file metadata.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to file metadata. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about private files.
- **Attack vectors:** By guessing the ID of the file, a user can gain access to the file metadata.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** User-level access is required. The attacker needs the ability to guess file IDs.
