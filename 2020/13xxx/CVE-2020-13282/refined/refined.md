{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When a subgroup is transferred from one parent group to another, the members of the original parent group retain their access levels on the subgroup, even though they are not explicitly members of the subgroup or the new parent group.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect access control during subgroup transfer",
      "Ghost members with persistent access rights"
    ],
    "impact": "Members of the original parent group can maintain unauthorized access to the transferred subgroup and its projects, including the ability to modify resources and settings, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications. They are not visible in the member list of the transferred subgroup, making it difficult to identify unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "Transferring a subgroup from one parent group to another.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be a member of the original parent group with sufficient permissions (e.g., maintainer or owner) before the subgroup is transferred."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability allows members of the original parent group to have access to the transferred subgroups even when they are not explicitly listed as members. This could also grant them some level of access to the new parent group without being a member."
