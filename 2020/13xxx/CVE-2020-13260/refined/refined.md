Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the web-based management interface of the RAD SecFlow-1v device. The system fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied content when displaying it, resulting in a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This occurs because the device's web interface doesn't properly sanitize user-provided data, particularly within uploaded files.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Encoding:** The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and output encoding. Specifically, when uploading an OVPN file or a static key file via the web interface, the device directly displays the content of these files without sanitizing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious file (e.g., OVPN config or a static key file) containing JavaScript code. When an administrator or authorized user views the configuration page where the file content is displayed, the malicious JavaScript will execute within their browser session.
*   **Account Takeover Potential:** When combined with a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-13259), an attacker can upload a malicious file to exploit the stored XSS, potentially leading to full account takeover.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies or session tokens due to the arbitrary JavaScript execution, leading to hijacking the account.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could redirect users to a malicious website, steal credentials, or perform other malicious actions through the injected JavaScript code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector involves uploading a malicious file through the web management interface. Specifically, the "Configuration-Services-Security-OpenVPN-Config" or "Configuration-Services-Security-OpenVPN-Static Keys" upload features are vulnerable.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker relies on an authorized user visiting the affected page on the device's web-based management interface through their web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the RAD SecFlow-1v device. This could be from the internal network or, if exposed, from the internet.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker will need to be authenticated to the device's web management interface (or use the CSRF to perform actions without authentication), otherwise, they will not be able to upload a malicious file and trigger the stored XSS.
*  **CSRF exploit (optional, for full account takeover):** To exploit the full potential of this vulnerability, the attacker would need the ability to leverage a CSRF exploit (CVE-2020-13259).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the RAD SecFlow-1v with OS image SF\_0290\_2.3.01.26.
*   A simple proof of concept involves uploading a file containing `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`. This will trigger a JavaScript alert when the affected page is viewed.
*   The issue is triggered by displaying the contents of the uploaded OVPN or static key file without proper sanitization or encoding, leading to execution of the script included in the file.
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple pages of the web interface.

**Mitigation:**

*   RAD has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   Users of the affected device should upgrade to the latest firmware version.
*  Input validation and output encoding should be implemented to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.

In summary, CVE-2020-13260 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the RAD SecFlow-1v device that can be exploited by uploading malicious files, potentially leading to account takeover.
