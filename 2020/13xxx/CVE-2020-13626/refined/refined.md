Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient protection of the SMS functionality by the OnePlus App Locker. Specifically, Google Assistant can bypass the App Locker when sending SMS messages, even though the SMS application itself is locked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of App Locker:** The core vulnerability is the ability to circumvent the App Locker's intended protection of the SMS application via Google Assistant. The assistant can send SMS messages without the need to unlock the SMS app.
- **Lack of Proper Authentication:** The SMS is sent without proper authentication when using Google Assistant, even though the application is locked.
- **Insecure Communication between Applications:** The interaction between Google Assistant and the SMS functionality bypasses the security measures put in place by the App Locker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized SMS Sending:** An attacker, or even a malicious application using Google Assistant, could send SMS messages through a user's phone without the user's explicit consent, even if the SMS app is locked with the App Locker.
- **Privacy Violation:** The content of sent messages is not protected by the App Locker in this scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Google Assistant:** The primary attack vector is utilizing Google Assistant commands to send SMS messages. Specifically, the command "Message {Contact}" triggers the vulnerable behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the OnePlus Device:** The attacker needs physical or remote access to the victim's OnePlus device.
- **Voice Command Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to issue voice commands to Google Assistant or have a malicious app that can leverage the Google Assistant API.
- **Basic Understanding of Google Assistant:** The attacker needs to know the specific voice commands that trigger the vulnerability.
