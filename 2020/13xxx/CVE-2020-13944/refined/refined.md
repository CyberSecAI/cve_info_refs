The provided content discusses CVE-2020-17515 and CVE-2021-28359, and explicitly states that CVE-2020-17515 is the same issue as CVE-2020-13944, but with an incomplete fix. Therefore, the information is relevant to CVE-2020-13944.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "origin" parameter in the URL passed to specific endpoints like '/trigger' was vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the "origin" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. This code could be used to steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the "origin" parameter and tricks a user into clicking it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs with the vulnerable parameter and to trick the victim into clicking these URLs.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be on the same network, as they can distribute malicious links through various channels, including email and social media.
