- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OpenEDX platform allows instructors to create custom Python-evaluated problems. By inserting malicious Python code within the `<script type="python">` tag, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to unsanitized execution of user-provided python code. The platform doesn't have adequate input sanitization for user-provided Python code within the custom problem feature, specifically within the `<script type="python">` tags of the problem definition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the OpenEDX platform. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities. In the example provided, the attacker was able to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the custom Python-evaluated problem feature in the OpenEDX platform's Studio. An attacker, as an instructor, can craft a malicious problem containing Python code within the  `<script type="python">` tags.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have instructor-level privileges within the OpenEDX platform. Specifically, the ability to create courses, units, and problems is required.
