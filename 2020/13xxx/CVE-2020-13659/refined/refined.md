Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13659:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is due to an issue in the `address_space_map` function within QEMU's `exec.c`. This function is responsible for mapping physical memory into the host's virtual address space. The flaw occurs when, under certain conditions (specifically, when a "BounceBuffer" is in use), `address_space_map` returns `NULL` without also setting the length parameter (`plen`) to zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When `address_space_map` returns `NULL` and the length is not set to zero, subsequent operations that expect a valid memory mapping may attempt to dereference this `NULL` pointer, resulting in a crash.
*   **Improper Resource Handling**: The function fails to properly handle a scenario where resources needed for mapping are exhausted/unavailable (BounceBuffer in use).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker (typically, a guest user/process) can trigger the NULL pointer dereference, causing QEMU to crash. This results in a DoS condition on the host, disrupting the virtualized environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest OS Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by actions originating from within a guest operating system running on the vulnerable QEMU instance. This indicates a local attack vector where the attacker has to have access to execute code in the guest.
*  **Crafted MMIO operations:** A crafted address in an msi-x mmio operation can lead to this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Execution in Guest:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code inside a guest operating system being emulated by the vulnerable QEMU instance. This could be achieved through compromised software or direct access within the VM.
*   **Trigger Specific Conditions**: The attacker needs to trigger the conditions within QEMU where a BounceBuffer is in use during the physical memory to virtual memory address mapping causing `address_space_map()` to return NULL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 emulation, suggesting that the attacker must somehow interact with the emulated hardware.
*  The fix involves ensuring the map length is explicitly set to zero when `address_space_map()` returns NULL, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
*  The issue was discovered by Alexander Bulekov and was reported to QEMU developers.
* The vulnerability has a **moderate** severity according to SUSE's assessment
