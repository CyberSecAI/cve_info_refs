  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way GitLab handles Mermaid diagrams in issue descriptions. Specifically, users can define class names for elements within these diagrams. By setting the class name to `js-issuable-actions` and `btn-close` in conjunction with the `click` action, an attacker can trick the GitLab application to send a PUT request to an arbitrary URL when a user clicks on the crafted diagram element.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary PUT request",
       "Lack of input validation" ,
      "Improper handling of user-controlled data in Mermaid diagrams"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can make arbitrary PUT requests on behalf of the victim, potentially modifying data or performing other actions, leading to data corruption or other unauthorized modifications. The provided example shows how an attacker can change issue descriptions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious Mermaid diagram and embeds it in a GitLab issue description. When a user views the issue and clicks the crafted diagram element, a PUT request is sent to the attacker-specified URL.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a GitLab issue to insert a malicious Mermaid diagram. They can then target other users viewing the issue."
