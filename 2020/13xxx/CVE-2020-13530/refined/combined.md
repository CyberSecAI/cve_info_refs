# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1143

## EIP Stack Group OpENer ethernet/IP server denial-of-service vulnerability

##### December 2, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13530

### Summary

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Ethernet/IP server functionality of the EIP Stack Group OpENer 2.3 and development commit 8c73bf3. A large number of network requests in a small span of time can cause the running program to stop. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

EIP Stack Group OpENer 2.3

EIP Stack Group OpENer development commit 8c73bf3

### Product URLs

<https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-910 - Use of Expired File Descriptor

### Details

OpENer is an EtherNet/IP stack for I/O adapter devices. It supports multiple I/O and explicit connections and includes objects and services for making EtherNet/IP-compliant products as defined in the ODVA specification.

Overloading the OpENer application with requests will result in a broken pipe, when it tries to reply to a socket that has already been closed.

The issue happens since the code does not handle signals of type `SIGPIPE`. In the `source/src/ports/` subdirectory, in file `generic_networkhandler.c`, the following `send()` call takes place in line 846:

```
datasent = send(socket, (char ) outgoingmessage.messagebuffer,
                       outgoingmessage.usedmessagelength, 0);

```

If the remote client has already closed the socket when OpENer tries to write to it, a SIGPIPE is triggered by the OS to the application, which results in OpENer being shut down due to the signal not being handled.

### Crash Information

Strace output for the process:

```
