- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not handle `SIGPIPE` signals, which are triggered when the application attempts to write to a socket that has been closed by the remote client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application lacks proper signal handling for `SIGPIPE`, leading to a crash when a closed socket is written to. This results in a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack causes the OpENer application to terminate, resulting in a denial of service. This means the device will stop responding to Ethernet/IP requests.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send a large number of network requests to the OpENer server in a short amount of time, causing the server to try to reply to a socket that has already been closed by the client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No specific authentication or privilege is required.
