Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure implementation of custom Python-evaluated problems within the OpenEDX platform. The platform allows users to define Python code within problem definitions, which is then executed server-side. This execution is not properly sandboxed or restricted, allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary Python code on the server hosting the OpenEDX platform.
- **Lack of Sandboxing:** The Python code provided by users is not executed within a secure sandbox environment.
- **Insecure Code Evaluation:** The system directly executes user-provided code without proper sanitization or restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Server Compromise:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full control over the server, access to sensitive data, and the ability to disrupt service.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could access sensitive data stored within the OpenEDX platform.
- **Malicious Modifications:** Attackers could modify course content, student data, or platform settings.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could execute resource-intensive code leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Custom Python-Evaluated Problems:** The attacker creates a course and a unit with a problem that uses the "Custom Python-Evaluated" type and embeds malicious code within the `<script type="python">` tag.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires a user to submit or interact with the maliciously created problem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Account Creation:** The attacker must create an account on the OpenEDX platform.
- **Course Creation Privilege:** The attacker must have the privilege to create courses and add content to it.
- **Knowledge of OpenEDX Features:** The attacker needs to be aware of the custom Python-evaluated problem functionality within the OpenEDX platform to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The content also mentions that a mitigation called "CodeJail" exists, but it's not enabled by default. This confirms the vulnerability is due to insecure handling of user-provided python code.
- The attacker also discovered several other vulnerabilities, including Stored XSS and CSV injection, which are not related to CVE-2020-13146.
