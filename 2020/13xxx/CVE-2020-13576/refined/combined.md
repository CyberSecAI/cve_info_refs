# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1187

## Genivia gSOAP WS-Addressing plugin code execution vulnerability

##### January 5, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13576

### Summary

A code execution vulnerability exists in the WS-Addressing plugin functionality of Genivia gSOAP 2.8.107. A specially crafted SOAP request can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Genivia gSOAP 2.8.107

### Product URLs

<https://www.genivia.com/products.html#gsoap>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-680 - Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow

### Details

The gSOAP toolkit is a C/C++ library for developing XML-based web services. It includes several plugins to support the implementation of SOAP and web service standards. The framework also provides multiple deployment options including modules for both IIS and Apache, standalone CGI scripts and its own standalone HTTP service.

One of the many plugins provided by gSOAP includes the wsa plugin for supporting the WS-Addressing specification which provides an asynchronous mechanism for routing SOAP requests and responses. The specification includes a  element for providing URI parameters to a number of different parts of both requests and responses. The URIs may include a username and password for the resource in a standard format. http://user:password@somehost.com A buffer overflow vulnerability existing in the parsing of these extra parameters.

It starts by looking for the `:` in the uri and assumes that if it’s not part of `://` that is is the seperator between the username and password.

```
21234   s = strchr(endpoint, ':');
21235   if (s && s[1] == '/' && s[2] == '/') // Skip the :// part of the parameter
21236     s += 3;
21237   else // Assume it's the seperator and start from the beginning of the element
21238     s = endpoint;

```

Processing continues by trying to find the `@` to seperate the user:pass from the hostname. At this point, parsing of the username and password occurs assuming we have found both seperators (`@` and `:`)

```
21240   t = strchr(s, '@'); // attempts to find the seperator
21241
21242   if (t && *s != ':' && *s != '@')
21243   {
21244     size_t l = t - s + 1;  // Calculate the size of the user:pass part of the string
21245     char *r = (char*)soap_malloc(soap, l); // Allocate enough storage to hold both the user and pass
21246     n = s - endpoint;
21247     if (r)
21248     {
21249       s = soap_decode(r, l, s, ":@");  // s is still pointing to the beginning of the data in this element
21250       soap->userid = r; // r is now a copy of the user part of the string up to the :
21251       soap->passwd = SOAP_STR_EOS;
21252       if (*s == ':') // s now points to the : seperator
21253       {
21254         s++; // Step past the seperator and now we should be pointing to the password section
21255         if (*s != '@') // Make sure the password isn't empty
21256         {
21257           l = t - s + 1; // t points to the @ seperator so here we calculate the length of the password by subtracting between the two seperators
21258           r = r + strlen(r) + 1; // r currently points to the copied username so we skip past to copy the password into the same buffer.
21259           s = soap_decode(r, l, s, "@"); // l is now a very large number allowing us to write us much data to the head as we like and cleanly terminate the copy with an @
21260           soap->passwd = r;
21261         }
21262       }
21263     }
21264     s++;
21265     soap_strcpy(soap->endpoint + n, sizeof(soap->endpoint) - n, s);
21266   }

```

Here the code makes an assumption about the order of the `:` and `@` seperators. It assumes that the `@` (`t`) is after `:`(`s`) and calculates the size for the second soap\_decode based on this assumption. If the `:` comes after the `@`, this calculation causes the calculated size to be negative and wrap around and become a very large length value to `soap_decode` to parse the password.

Within soap\_decode, an attempt to copy the data into a the new heap buffer occurs. As the length is a very large number and the counter is counting backwards, we are able to write an arbitrary amount of data past our destination buffer.

```
7919 soap_decode(char *buf, size_t len, const char *val, const char *sep)
7920 {
7921   const char *s;
7922   char *t = buf;
7923   size_t i = len;
7924   for (s = val; *s; s++)
7925     if (*s != ' ' && *s != '\t' && !strchr(sep, *s))
7926       break;
7927   if (len > 0)
7928   {
7929     if (*s == '"')
7930     {
7931       s++;
7932
7933       while (*s && *s != '"' && --i)
7934         *t++ = *s++;
7935     }

```

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 34 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchain](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchain "Changes/GNUToolchain")
* [F34Boost175](/wiki/Changes/F34Boost175 "Changes/F34Boost175")
* [F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.16](/wiki/Changes/golang1.16 "Changes/golang1.16")
* [Remove\_make\_from\_BuildRoot](/wiki/Changes/Remove_make_from_BuildRoot "Changes/Remove make from BuildRoot")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, Januar 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

### Remove make from BuildRoot

*koji block-group-pkg f34-rebuild build make*

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f34
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f34. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f34 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f34
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-20 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback
