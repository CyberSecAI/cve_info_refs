Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of URI parameters within the WS-Addressing plugin of the Genivia gSOAP toolkit. Specifically, it's triggered when parsing username and password information embedded in the URI. The code incorrectly handles the order of `:` and `@` separators within the URI, leading to an integer overflow during the length calculation for the password, which wraps around, resulting in a very large length value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates the length of the password by subtracting the address of the `@` character from the address of the `:` character, assuming the `:` always comes before `@`. When the `@` appears before the `:`, this calculation wraps around to become a large positive value.
*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The large calculated length is then used by `soap_decode` when copying the password, leading to an arbitrary amount of data being written beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By sending a specially crafted SOAP request with a malicious URI, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow, which could then allow them to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a malicious HTTP request containing a specially crafted SOAP message.
*   **SOAP Request:** The attack is triggered via the `wsa:To` or other similar elements that contain URIs within SOAP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service.
*   **Knowledge of SOAP:** An attacker needs to craft a SOAP request with a malicious URI in the `wsa:To` element (or similar).
*   **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication, meaning any attacker with network access to the service is able to try to exploit the issue.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Genivia gSOAP 2.8.107.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-13576.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Cisco Talos.
*   Patches have been released to address this issue.
