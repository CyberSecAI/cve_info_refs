Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13389:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Tenda router's web server (httpd).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `schedStartTime` and `schedEndTime` parameters from a POST request are directly copied using `strcpy` to a local variable on the stack.
- No bounds checking is performed before copying, allowing for a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer.
- Overwriting the stack will also overwrite the return address of the function

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, giving the attacker control over the router
- The provided POC results in a Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint.
- The attacker must control the `schedStartTime` and `schedEndTime` parameters in the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router's web server.
- This is typically achieved through a network connection to the router or from a browser on a device connected to the same network.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Tenda AC6, AC9, AC15, and AC18 series routers with specific firmware versions.
- The vulnerability is present in both ARM and MIPS architectures.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability by sending an overly long string for the `schedStartTime` parameter.
