The provided content relates to CVE-2020-13263.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that when a project mirror is removed, the `project.mirror_user` relationship is not also removed. This allows a maintainer to create a new pull mirror and assign the old mirror user to it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent state management: The system fails to properly clear the association between a project and its mirror user when the mirror is removed.
- Inadequate access control: A maintainer can assign a mirror user other than themselves, violating the intended restriction that only they can be the mirror user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Backdoor access: A temporary maintainer can set up a mirror using a permanent maintainer's account, even after their own access is revoked. This allows them to push commits to the project with maintainer privileges.
- Privilege escalation: A user can effectively gain privileges beyond their current level.

**Attack vectors:**
- Project settings: The vulnerability can be exploited through the project's "Mirroring repositories" settings.
- Pull mirror creation: The specific attack requires creating a new "pull" mirror.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have "maintainer" role for the project.
- The attacker needs to know the username of a "permanent maintainer" who has created and removed mirror before.
- The attacker needs to be able to access project settings.
