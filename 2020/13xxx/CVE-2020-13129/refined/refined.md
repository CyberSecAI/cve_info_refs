Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-13129:

**1. Verification:**
The content from `www.jvanlaak.de_7f8cfe3c_20250119_120047.html` and `www.jvanlaak.de_b061eb2d_20250119_120047.html` directly reference **CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings** and explicitly mention that it is also known as **CVE-2020-13129**. Therefore, the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of the HTTP GET method to transmit sensitive session credentials (client key and device ID, forming a sessionID) as parameters in the URL, instead of using cookies or other more secure methods.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Exposure of sensitive information in URLs:** The sessionID is included as a parameter in the URL, which is transmitted over the network.
- **Lack of proper session management:** The sessionID is valid for a long period, potentially days, if the user does not log out, increasing the window of opportunity for attackers.
- **No end-to-end encryption for files:** Although not directly related to CWE-598, the advisory mentions that files are not end-to-end encrypted, exacerbating the impact.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** An attacker who gains access to the sessionID can log into the system without needing the user's password.
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can access and download the user's files, as they are not end-to-end encrypted.
- **Circumvention of security measures:** Direct requests to the API using tools like `curl` can bypass browser-level security restrictions such as file export blocking.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- **Server log access:** An attacker with access to web server logs can obtain sessionIDs from the logged URLs.
- **SSL gateway logs:** Similarly, logs from SSL gateways can also reveal sessionIDs.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** Although the vendor dismissed this, an attacker could intercept the sessionID through network sniffing.
- **Referer strings:** As stated in the comments, the session information could be leaked through the referer string.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires access to either web server logs, SSL gateway logs, or the ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to capture the sessionID.
- They do not require the user's password.
- Knowledge of how to construct API requests.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content highlights a disagreement between the vendor's assessment of the vulnerability's severity and the CVSS scores provided by independent organizations.
- The vendor initially downplayed the severity, focusing only on the man-in-the-middle attack vector, while ignoring other methods of leaking sessionIDs such as logs and referer strings.
- The vendor did eventually release a fix in version 3.10.0 and made changes to the website to state files were not encrypted.
