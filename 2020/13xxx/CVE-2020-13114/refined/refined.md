  "CVE-2020-13114": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in libexif before 0.6.22. An unrestricted size in handling Canon EXIF MakerNote data could lead to consumption of large amounts of compute time for decoding EXIF data.",
    "Root cause": "An unrestricted size in handling Canon EXIF MakerNote data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted size handling",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "Consumption of large amounts of compute time during EXIF data decoding, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network (remote)",
      "Local"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted file with malicious Canon EXIF MakerNote data",
       "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing of Canon EXIF MakerNote data, and a crafted file could cause extremely large values in some tags without tripping any buffer range checks leading to large amount of compute time usage and denial of service.  The patch adds a failsafe on the maximum number of Canon MakerNote subtags by tracking the size of the decoded tag data. If the total size of the data in the tags becomes extraordinarily large, the process is aborted. The largest value seen in valid Canon files is <5000, the limit is set to 1,000,000 to avoid false positives."
