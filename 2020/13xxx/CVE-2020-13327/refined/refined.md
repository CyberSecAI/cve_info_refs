{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Kubernetes Executor executes jobs on pods with the default security context, which allows `CAP_NET_RAW` capability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Default security context of Kubernetes pods allows `CAP_NET_RAW`.",
       "GitLab runner is deployed in the same cluster as the GitLab instance in the default Helm chart installation."
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious workloads can use arpspoofing and other methods to attack other workloads running on the same node, potentially leading to admin control over the GitLab instance.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Arpspoofing and other network-level attacks.",
      "Injection of a `GitlabShellWorker` job."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to execute code within a GitLab CI job running on the same Kubernetes cluster as the GitLab instance. The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the CI job to run on a node in the same network segment as the target service.",
    "additional_details": "The provided script demonstrates how to use `arpspoof` and `tcpkill` to sniff the redis authentication token, then inject a job to create an admin user. The vulnerability exists because the GitLab runner is installed by default in the same Kubernetes cluster as the GitLab instance and has `CAP_NET_RAW` capability enabled by default."
