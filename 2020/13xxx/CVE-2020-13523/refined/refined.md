- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `spvve.sys` driver creates a device object accessible to any user, allowing them to send crafted I/O request packets (IRP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to an improperly handled IRP leading to kernel pool memory address leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass kASLR mitigation and potentially achieve local privilege escalation by using this vulnerability in conjunction with another.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malicious IRP to the `\Device\SoftPerfectVolume` device object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user on the system and be able to send IRPs to the specified device object.
