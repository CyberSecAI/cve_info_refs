# Security Advisories for Ivanti DSM Suite

From the end of 2019 on, we reported two critical vulnerabilities in the Ivanti DSM Suite to the vendor. The following CVE IDs were assigned to the issues (but note that they have a status of RESERVED, i.e. titles and descriptions may change in the future):

* CVE-2020-12441: Denial-of-Service (DoS) in Ivanti Service Manager HEAT Remote Control 7.4
* CVE-2020-13793: Unsafe storage of AD credentials in Ivanti DSM netinst 5.1

The vulnerabilities have meanwhile been fixed and an updated software version can be downloaded [here](http://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Ivanti-DSM-Download-Center).

The vulnerabilities have been found in the course of an extensive research project, in which we analyze the security of multiple end-system management solutions. Similar vulnerabilities have been found in other solutions and are currently in the responsible disclosure process. The final outcome of the research project will be published as a conference talk and/or whitepaper as soon as the project including all disclosure processes is finished.

We will provide a short description here such that you can understand the impact of the vulnerabilities better:

## CVE-2020-12441

CVE-2020-12441 is a buffer overflow in the protocol parser of the ‘HEATRemoteService’ agent, which can be triggered over the network (default port: 5900). The overflow causes a Denial-Of-Service and it may be possible to extended it to gain Remote Code Execution on the system.

The following products have been tested as vulnerable so far:

Product: HEATRemoteServer.exe

SW Version: 7.4 <v0>

## CVE-2020-13793

The Ivanti DSM netinst program stores encrypted passwords of service accounts in configuration files on end user systems. At least one of the available encryption methods uses a static, hard-coded key that can be extracted from the DSM Client Agent executables. Both, the configuration file and the respective DLL libraries which contain the hard-coded key are readable by unprivileged users. The service account passwords can be decrypted with the static key and likely have elevated privileges on end user and server systems in the respective environment.

The following products have been tested as vulnerable so far:

Product: Ivanti DSM netinst

SW Version: 5.1
