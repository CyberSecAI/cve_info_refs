Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-13793:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Ivanti DSM netinst program stores encrypted service account passwords in configuration files on end-user systems.
- At least one of the encryption methods uses a static, hard-coded key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The encryption key used to protect the service account passwords is hardcoded within the DSM Client Agent executables.
-   **Insecure Storage:** Configuration files containing encrypted passwords and the libraries containing the hardcoded key are readable by unprivileged users.
-   **Weak Encryption:** The usage of a static key makes the encryption weak and easily reversible.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Credential Disclosure:** An attacker can extract the static key from the client agent executables and use it to decrypt the service account passwords.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** The decrypted service accounts likely have elevated privileges on both end-user and server systems in the environment, potentially allowing for complete compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to a system with the vulnerable Ivanti DSM netinst program installed can read the configuration file and extract the key from the DLLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to have unprivileged access to a system where the vulnerable Ivanti DSM netinst program is installed.
-   The attacker needs to be able to read configuration files and extract the key from the executable files.
