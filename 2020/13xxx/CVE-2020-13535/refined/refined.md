- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the `LinkMasterV3` service. The service grants the `Everyone` group access to the `SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG` option.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to incorrect default permissions, specifically allowing `Everyone` to reconfigure the service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the service binary to point to an arbitrary executable. This arbitrary executable will then run with `NT SYSTEM` privileges, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. An attacker must have access to the system running the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the Kepware LinkMaster service is running. No special privileges are required initially.
