The provided content is a changelog for a Craft CMS plugin called "image-resizer". It includes information about bug fixes, new features, and changes made in different versions of the plugin.

Specifically, version `2.0.9` lists the following fixes:

### Fixed

*   **Fix stored XSS in Bulk Resize action.** Thanks Paweł Hałdrzyński (Limpid Security).
*   **Fix CSRF issues with log-clear controller action.** Thanks Paweł Hałdrzyński (Limpid Security).

Based on this, the content relates to a stored XSS vulnerability and CSRF vulnerability in the image-resizer plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stored XSS: Input sanitization was not performed on user-controlled data used in the Bulk Resize action, allowing malicious code to be stored and executed by other users.
- CSRF: The log-clear controller action did not have proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trigger actions on behalf of authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS
- CSRF

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stored XSS: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the browsers of other users who interact with the vulnerable function, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- CSRF: An attacker could trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions such as clearing logs without their knowledge or consent.

**Attack vectors:**
- Stored XSS: An attacker could inject malicious code through the Bulk Resize action of the plugin, likely through a form field or parameter that is not correctly sanitized.
- CSRF: An attacker could send a crafted request to the log-clear controller action using social engineering, or by embedding the request on a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Stored XSS: Requires the ability to use the bulk resize action and have some knowledge of how to inject XSS
- CSRF: Requires the target user to be logged in to the application and be tricked into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page.
