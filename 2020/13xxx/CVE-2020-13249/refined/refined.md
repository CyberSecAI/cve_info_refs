CVE-2020-13249:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: libmariadb/mariadb_lib.c in MariaDB Connector/C does not properly validate the content of an OK packet received from a server.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper validation of server responses leading to potential exploitation.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially manipulate the server response to trigger unexpected behavior in the client, possibly leading to crashes or other vulnerabilities.
  - Attack vectors: Network access to the MariaDB server.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to control the server response, potentially through a man-in-the-middle attack or by compromising the server itself.

CVE-2020-2760:
  - Root cause of vulnerability:  Unspecified vulnerability in the InnoDB component of MySQL Server.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the InnoDB component.
  - Impact of exploitation: Successful attacks can result in a complete denial of service (hang or crash) of the MySQL server, and unauthorized data modification (update, insert, or delete access).
  - Attack vectors: Network access via multiple protocols.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A high privileged attacker with network access is required.

CVE-2020-2752:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Unspecified vulnerability in the C API of MySQL Client.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Difficult to exploit vulnerability in the C API.
  - Impact of exploitation: Successful attacks can result in a denial of service (hang or crash) of the MySQL client.
  - Attack vectors: Network access via multiple protocols.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A low privileged attacker with network access is required.

CVE-2020-2812:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Unspecified vulnerability in the Server: Stored Procedure component of MySQL Server.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Easily exploitable vulnerability in the Stored Procedure component.
  - Impact of exploitation: Successful attacks can result in a complete denial of service (hang or crash) of the MySQL server.
  - Attack vectors: Network access via multiple protocols.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A high privileged attacker with network access is required.

CVE-2020-2814:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Unspecified vulnerability in the InnoDB component of MySQL Server.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unspecified vulnerability in the InnoDB component.
  - Impact of exploitation:  Successful attacks can result in a complete denial of service (hang or crash) of the MySQL server.
    - Attack vectors: Network access via multiple protocols.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A high privileged attacker with network access is required.
