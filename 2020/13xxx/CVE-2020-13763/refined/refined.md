{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default textfilter configuration did not block HTML inputs for 'Guest' users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Permissions: The default settings allowed HTML input from guest users where it should have been blocked.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Low.  The specific impact is not detailed, but it relates to unfiltered input, which can potentially lead to various issues if not handled correctly on the application side. This could include things like unwanted formatting changes, and depending on where the input is used and displayed, potential XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing HTML input through areas of the application that process user inputs. This affects 'Guest' users prior to version 3.9.19.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to submit input to the application as a guest user. No authentication is needed."
