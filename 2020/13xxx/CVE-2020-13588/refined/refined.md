The provided content is related to CVE-2020-13588.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `heading_field_id` parameter, `entities_id`, and `selected_fields` parameters within the 'entities/fields' page are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89) is present in multiple parameters in the `entities/fields` page.
  - `heading_field_id` parameter in the `set_heading_field_id` action.
  - `entities_id` parameter in the `mulitple_edit`, `copy_selected`, or `export` actions.
  - `selected_fields` parameter in the `mulitple_edit`, `copy_selected`, or `export` actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Modify data within the database.
- Potentially compromise the entire application and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `entities/fields` page.
- Specific actions like `set_heading_field_id`, `mulitple_edit`, `copy_selected`, or `export` trigger the vulnerabilities based on the manipulated parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application, either with administrator privileges or by exploiting a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoints.
