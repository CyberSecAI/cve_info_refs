Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-13784:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a predictable seed in the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to create session cookies. Specifically, the PRNG is seeded with the time of the login attempt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable PRNG:** The use of time as the seed for the PRNG makes the generated session cookies predictable.
*   **Insufficient Randomness:**  The generated session cookies are not sufficiently random or unique, enabling attackers to potentially guess or calculate them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** By predicting session cookies, an attacker can bypass authentication and impersonate a legitimate user.
*   **CSRF Attacks:**  The predicted cookies can be used to carry out cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Bypass HTTPS Encryption:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass HTTPS encryption because they can obtain the session cookie needed to access authenticated sections of the router's management interface, even if HTTPS is used to encrypt session information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** Attackers can passively monitor network traffic to observe the initial login and note the approximate time of the login attempt.
*   **Time Guessing:** With the approximate login time, an attacker can calculate the session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic of the target router's network.
*   **Time Approximation:** The attacker needs to estimate the approximate login time of a legitimate user.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how the session cookies are generated and how the PRNG is seeded.
