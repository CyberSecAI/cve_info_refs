Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2020-13934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue in Apache Tomcat's handling of HTTP/2 connections. Specifically, when an h2c (HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP) direct connection upgraded from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, the HTTP/1.1 processor was not properly released.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Leak:** The failure to release the HTTP/1.1 processor resulted in a resource leak.
*  **Denial of Service:** Accumulation of these unreleased processors can lead to an `OutOfMemoryException`.
*  **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability highlights missing input validation during the transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS). This occurs because the accumulation of unreleased resources eventually exhausts available memory, causing the Tomcat server to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending multiple h2c direct requests to the server.
*   **HTTP/2:** The vulnerability exploits a weakness in the h2c direct connection implementation in Apache Tomcat.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the target server.
*   **Ability to Send Malicious Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send multiple HTTP/2 requests (h2c direct connection requests) to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No authentication is required** for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Details from the Provided Documents:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 through 10.0.0-M6, 9.0.0.M5 through 9.0.36, 8.5.1 through 8.5.56, and 7.0.0 through 7.0.104 are susceptible.
*   **NetApp Products:**  Some NetApp products that incorporate Apache Tomcat are affected (specifically, OnCommand System Manager 3.x), whereas others are not. The vulnerability within NetApp products only results in a denial of service.
*  **SUSE Products:** A number of SUSE products are also affected. Specific versions and fixed packages are provided in the documents.
*   **Oracle Products:** Several Oracle products are affected by this vulnerability, including Oracle Database Server and Oracle Fusion Middleware.
*  **SUSE Severity:** SUSE rated the vulnerability as having moderate severity.
* **SUSE Bugzilla:** SUSE bugzilla entry 1174121 is associated with this CVE
* **SUSE CVSS Score**: SUSE assigned this CVE a CVSS base score of 6.5

The provided information from different sources (NetApp, SUSE, Oracle, Debian, OpenSUSE) paints a comprehensive picture of the CVE-2020-13934 vulnerability, its cause, impact, affected components, and mitigation strategies.

It's worth noting that while the vulnerability is rated as HIGH in the NVD database with a CVSS score of 7.5, SUSE rated it as having moderate severity with a base score of 6.5. The difference in severity scores can be due to how different organizations assess risk and impact, or different attack vectors considered.
