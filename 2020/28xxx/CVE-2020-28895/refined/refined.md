Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2020-28895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory allocator issue within Wind River VxWorks.
- Specifically, there's an overflow when calculating the memory block size during a call to `calloc()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Memory Size Calculation:** The memory allocator incorrectly calculates the required size for the memory block.
- **Heap Overflow:** Because the allocated memory is smaller than what's requested, writing beyond the allocated buffer can cause memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation leads to memory corruption due to the buffer overflow. This can cause application crashes, unexpected behavior or allow for further exploitation (e.g. code execution).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is within the VxWorks operating system's memory allocation routines, specifically in `calloc()`.
- Exploitation would likely involve making calls to `calloc()` with specific arguments that trigger the size calculation overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to execute code within the context of a VxWorks system to trigger this vulnerability
- The attacker would need to be able to control the size parameters used in calls to `calloc()` to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.3 (HIGH).
- The vulnerability affects VxWorks versions 7 and 6.9.
- The vulnerability was fixed in VxWorks 7 (21.03) and VxWorks 6.9 (6.9.4.12 RCPL3).
- The vulnerability is not present in Wind River Linux, Helix Virtualization Platform Cert Edition or eLxr.
- A defect ID associated with the fix is VXHVP-428.
