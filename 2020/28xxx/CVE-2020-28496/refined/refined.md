  "CVE-2020-28496": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a regular expression used to parse color values in the `Color.setStyle` function within the three.js library. The regex `^((?:rgb|hsl)a?)\(\\s*([^\\)]*)\\)` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, a condition that allows an attacker to cause excessive CPU consumption by crafting a malicious input string.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted input string to the color parsing function. This can lead to excessive CPU consumption, making the system unavailable to legitimate users.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `Color.setStyle` function of the three.js library, specifically when handling 'rgb' or 'hsl' color strings. The attacker must be able to influence the input to this function. The provided PoC demonstrates how to construct such an input string using spaces within an rgb string.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input string that is passed to the `Color` constructor of the three.js library."

    "affected_versions": "<0.125.0 (npm package 'three'), <0.127.0 (maven package 'org.webjars.npm:three')",
    "fix_versions": ">=0.125.0 (npm package 'three'), >=0.127.0 (maven package 'org.webjars.npm:three')",
      "details": "The vulnerable regular expression, `^((?:rgb|hsl)a?)\(\\s*([^\\)]*)\\)`, attempts to parse color strings.  The `[^\\)]*` part of the regex is the main source of the issue. It allows matching of any character that is not a closing parenthesis. When given a string that does not contain a closing parenthesis, this causes the regex engine to backtrack extensively in its search, leading to catastrophic backtracking and high CPU usage. The fix was to change the regex to `^((?:rgb|hsl)a?)\(\\s*([^\\)\\s]*)\\)` which excludes white space in the character match."
