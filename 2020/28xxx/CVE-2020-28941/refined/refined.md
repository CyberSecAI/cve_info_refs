Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-28941:

**Root Cause:**
- The Speakup screen reader subsystem in the Linux kernel does not properly enforce that it is bound to only one terminal (tty) device at a time. The code uses a single `speakup_tty` variable to store the tty it is managing, assuming only one user controls the screen reading.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect locking:** The `speakup_tty` variable is not correctly protected against concurrent access when multiple tty devices are opened and closed with Speakup.
- **Use-after-free:** When a tty with Speakup enabled is closed, the `spk_ttyio_ldisc_close` function frees the `speakup_tty->disc_data` and sets `speakup_tty` to NULL. If another tty device is opened and set as `speakup_tty` before the first one is fully closed, the second close would attempt to dereference the now NULL `speakup_tty`, which leads to the null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability can cause a kernel crash due to a null pointer dereference, leading to system instability or unavailability.
-  Memory exhaustion is also mentioned as potential impact, although not elaborated on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to open multiple tty devices and use `tiocsetd()` to set their line discipline to the speakup line discipline.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account on the target system.
- Ability to open tty devices (e.g., `/dev/ptmx`).
- Ability to use `ioctl` with `TIOCSETD` to set the line discipline to the Speakup driver (`0x1a`).

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `drivers/accessibility/speakup/spk_ttyio.c` file, specifically the `spk_ttyio_ldisc_close` function.
- The fix involves adding a mutex to prevent concurrent use of the speakup line discipline (`spk_ttyio_ldisc_open` function). Specifically, the fix ensures that if speakup_tty is already in use then `spk_ttyio_ldisc_open` will return -EBUSY, preventing a race condition.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided patch ([https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty.git/commit/?h=tty-linus&id=d4122754442799187d5d537a9c039a49a67e57f1](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty.git/commit/?h=tty-linus&id=d4122754442799187d5d537a9c039a49a67e57f1)) introduces a mutex lock to prevent the use of the line discipline on multiple ttys, effectively resolving the issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by Shisong Qin and Bodong Zhao from Tsinghua University.
- The vulnerability was present in Linux kernel versions 4.19 and 5.9.
- The fix was backported to stable kernel branches.
