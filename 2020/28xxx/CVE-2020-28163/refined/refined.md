  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-28163",
    "description": "If a DWARF5 line table header has an invalid FORM for a pathname, the fi_file_name field may be null and printing it via %s can result in referencing memory at address 0, possibly generating segmentation violation or application crash. Now in case of null we provide a fixed string of <no file name> and for the form code we print the value and <unknown form> so there are no unpredictable effects.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing null check when printing the `fi_file_name` field in a DWARF5 line table header. If the DWARF data is corrupt and the `fi_file_name` field is null, a direct dereference will lead to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing null pointer check",
      "Improper handling of corrupted data"
    ],
    "impact": "A segmentation violation or application crash can occur due to referencing memory at address 0 if the `fi_file_name` is null in a DWARF5 line table header.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a DWARF5 line table header with an invalid FORM for a pathname that results in a null `fi_file_name` field."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted object file that is parsed by the vulnerable `libdwarf` library."
