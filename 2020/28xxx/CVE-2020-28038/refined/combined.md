# WordPress 5.5.2 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 5.5.2 is now available!

This security and maintenance release features [14 bug fixes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=5.5.2&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&order=priority) in addition to 10 security fixes. Because this is a **security release**, it is recommended that you update your sites immediately. All versions since WordPress 3.7 have also been updated.

WordPress 5.5.2 is a short-cycle security and maintenance release. The next major release will be version 5.6.

You can download WordPress 5.5.2 by downloading from WordPress.org, or visit your Dashboard → Updates and click Update Now.

If you have sites that support automatic background updates, they’ve already started the update process.

### Security Updates

Ten security issues affect WordPress versions 5.5.1 and earlier. If you haven’t yet updated to 5.5, all WordPress versions since 3.7 have also been updated to fix the following security issues:

* Props to Alex Concha of the WordPress Security Team for their work in hardening deserialization requests.
* Props to David Binovec on a fix to disable spam embeds from disabled sites on a multisite network.
* Thanks to Marc Montas from Sucuri for reporting an issue that could lead to XSS from global variables.
* Thanks to Justin Tran who reported an issue surrounding privilege escalation in XML-RPC. He also found and disclosed an issue around privilege escalation around post commenting via XML-RPC.
* Props to Omar Ganiev who reported a method where a DoS attack could lead to RCE.
* Thanks to Karim El Ouerghemmi from [RIPS](https://www.ripstech.com/) who disclosed a method to store XSS in post slugs.
* Thanks to Slavco for reporting, and confirmation from Karim El Ouerghemmi, a method to bypass protected meta that could lead to arbitrary file deletion.
* Thanks to Erwan LR from [WPScan](https://wpscan.com/) who responsibly disclosed a method that could lead to CSRF.
* And a special thanks to [@zieladam](https://profiles.wordpress.org/zieladam/) who was integral in many of the releases and patches during this release.

Thank you to all of the reporters for [privately disclosing the vulnerabilities](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/). This gave the security team time to fix the vulnerabilities before WordPress sites could be attacked.

For more information, browse the [full list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=5.5.2&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&order=priority) on Trac, or check out the [version 5.5.2 HelpHub documentation page](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-5-2/).

CVE-2020-28034

    WordPress before 4.7.19 allows XSS associated with global
    variables.

CVE-2020-28035

    WordPress before 4.7.19 allows attackers to gain privileges via
    XML-RPC.

CVE-2020-28036

    wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php in WordPress before
    4.7.19 allows attackers to gain privileges by using XML-RPC to
    comment on a post.

CVE-2020-28037

    is_blog_installed in wp-includes/functions.php in WordPress
    before 4.7.19 improperly determines whether WordPress is
    already installed, which might allow an attacker to perform
    a new installation, leading to remote code execution (as well
    as a denial of service for the old installation).

CVE-2020-28038

    WordPress before 4.7.19 allows stored XSS via post slugs.

CVE-2020-28039

    is_protected_meta in wp-includes/meta.php in WordPress before
    4.7.19 allows arbitrary file deletion because it does not
    properly determine whether a meta key is considered protected.

CVE-2020-28040

    WordPress before 4.7.19 allows CSRF attacks that change a
    theme's background image.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.7.19+dfsg-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

Debian Bug     : 971914 973562

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to run insecure deserialization,
embed spam, perform various Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site
Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, escalate privileges, run arbitrary
code, and delete arbitrary files.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.11+dfsg1-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
