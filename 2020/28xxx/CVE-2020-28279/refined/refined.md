{
  "CVE-2020-28279": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "The `unflatten()` function in the 'flattenizer' npm module did not validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property, leading to prototype pollution.",
      "Weaknesses": "Prototype Pollution vulnerability. The lack of input validation on the property being assigned allows an attacker to manipulate the object prototype.",
      "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS) and potential Remote Code Execution (RCE). By polluting the prototype, an attacker could manipulate existing properties or create new ones, disrupting functionality or leading to RCE in vulnerable applications.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via network requests, allowing a remote attacker to exploit it.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to send a crafted input to the vulnerable `unflatten()` function. No specific privileges or user interaction is required."
    },
    "affected_components": {
      "affected_versions": "Versions 0.0.5 through 1.0.5 of the 'flattenizer' npm module are affected."
    },
    "fixes": {
      "recommended_action": "Upgrade to version 1.1.1 of the 'flattenizer' npm module.",
       "fix_details": "The fix involves preventing the unflatten function from setting properties on the __proto__ object."
