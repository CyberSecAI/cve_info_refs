Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The default speed test settings on the Tenda AC6 router (specifically located on `mtdbblock5`) point to URLs that host malware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Malicious URLs:** The router's firmware contains pre-configured URLs in its speed test settings that point to locations hosting executable malware.
    - `sh.vnet.cn/downloads/elive1.16.exe?0.4812286039814353`
    - `viewer.d.cnki.net/CNKI%20E-Learning%202.4.1-20140714.exe`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malware Infection:** If a user were to use the default speed test functionality of the router, it would initiate downloads from the malicious URLs, likely resulting in the user's devices being infected with malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the built-in speed test functionality of the router.
- A user interacting with the router's interface and initiating a speed test will unknowingly trigger downloads from the malicious URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No attacker interaction is needed beyond the initial setup of the router. The router is preconfigured with these malicious URLs.
- The attacker's "position" is within the firmware of the device, specifically by providing the malicious default speed test URLs.
