This code was added in [7486573](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/7486573df935b500df49a7aeaf8855eb9492b40f) / [#248](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/pull/248). Do absolute http requests even make sense except for HTTP proxies?

# Dev server redirects to arbitrary url when path starts with double slash // #1639

## Description

![@raminfp](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10054759?u=da73bdc0093c9bf2471a0e7c61c656fe9966be2a&v=4&size=48)[raminfp](https://github.com/raminfp)opened [on Dec 5, 2015](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1639#issue-120582423)
```
from flask import Flask
from flask import request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return  'hello'

app.run(debug=True, port=8000, host='0.0.0.0')
```

If I try to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8000//google.com> (2 slashes), I get redirected to google.com. I correctly get a 404 with <http://127.0.0.1:8000/google.com> (1 slash) and <http://127.0.0.1:8000///google.com> (3 slashses). This is a vulnerability, I shouldn't be redirected to arbitrary urls. Flask should prevent arbitrary redirects from urls.
