{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the TLS handshake handling within Mutt and NeoMutt. Specifically, when an IMAP server sends an illegal initial response during connection establishment, the clients would 'bail out' but fail to properly close the connection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling during TLS handshake",
      "Failure to close the connection on invalid server responses",
      "Reliance on connection status instead of return values for error checking"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to information disclosure, where authentication credentials might be sent over an unencrypted connection, especially if $ssl_force_tls was not consulted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sending a malicious IMAP server response"
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept or control IMAP server responses"
    ]
  },
  "affected_versions": {
    "mutt": "< 2.0.2",
    "neomutt": "< 20201120"
