Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-28858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the OpenAsset Digital Asset Management application. The application does not verify if a request made to itself was intentionally initiated by the user, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application fails to implement proper CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to validate the origin of requests. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Lack of input validation:** The provided PoC also demonstrates a stored XSS vulnerability by injecting malicious javascript into the web share name, which is made possible due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform any action within the application that the victim user is authorized to do. This includes administrative actions and user-specific actions.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a CSRF attack to inject a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload within a "web share" function, which would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution within other user's browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious HTML page that tricks a logged-in user into submitting a forged request to the vulnerable application without the user's knowledge.
- The attacker needs the user to visit the attacker's webpage while the user is logged into the target web application.
- Once the malicious request is submitted, it's processed by the target application as if it was initiated by the logged in user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to host an HTML page on a server they control.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a logged in user of the target application to visit the malicious HTML page.
- **Knowledge of the application**: The attacker needs to know the correct parameters and values to send within the CSRF request to successfully exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**

- 12.0.19 (Cloud)
- 11.2.1 (On-Premise)

**Fixed Versions:**
- 12.0.26 (Cloud)
- 11.4.10 (On-Premise)

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Jack Misiura of The Missing Link.
- The provided PoC uses the web share functionality to demonstrate the vulnerability, but all actions within the application are vulnerable to CSRF.
- The vendor has released patches to address the vulnerability.
- The provided PoC also allows the demonstration of a Stored XSS vulnerability via CSRF, meaning that an attacker can introduce a Stored XSS vulnerability through a CSRF attack.
