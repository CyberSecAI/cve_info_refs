The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28063.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure file upload handling in the ArticleCMS application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Inadequate file type validation:** The application only checks the `Content-Type` header during file uploads and doesn't validate the file extension. This allows attackers to bypass upload restrictions by manipulating the header.
2.  **File processing logic vulnerability**: Even with file abbreviation processing, files with a valid image header can still be uploaded to the server despite not returning an address to the user.
3.  **Insufficient filtering of PHP code:** While the CMS attempts to filter out `<?php` tags, it can be bypassed using short tags like `<?=`, or `<script language='php'></script>`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to:
*   Full compromise of the application and the underlying server.
*   Data theft.
*   Website defacement.
*   Further attacks on other systems accessible from the compromised server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the file upload functionality in the content editing feature of the application's admin panel, accessible at `http://ip/public/admin`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires access to the admin panel's content editing feature, implying that they need to have valid admin credentials or have found a way to bypass authentication mechanisms. The attacker also needs to be able to modify HTTP request headers, specifically the Content-Type header during a file upload.
