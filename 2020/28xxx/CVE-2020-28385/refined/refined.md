Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-28385:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DFT files within the affected applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The improper validation leads to an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when the application attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory for a data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running the affected application). This means that the attacker could potentially gain full control of the application and the user's machine.
*   **Crash:** Opening a malicious file can cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted malicious DFT file with the vulnerable application.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the user to open the file, the vulnerability has a local attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to rely on user interaction. The user must open the malicious file.
*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a malicious DFT file.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker can achieve exploitation by tricking the user locally.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Solid Edge.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Solid Edge SE2020MP13 and later versions and SE2021MP3 and later versions.
*   The advisory recommends avoiding opening untrusted files from unknown sources.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.8, indicating high severity.
