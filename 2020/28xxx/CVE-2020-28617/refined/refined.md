Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-28617:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of the CGAL library. Specifically, it occurs during the parsing of `.nef3` files.
- The code reads indexes from the input file and uses them to access vector elements without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. The code reads an index from the input file and uses it to access elements in vectors such as `Edge_of`, `SFace_of`, `SLoop_of`, etc. If a crafted input file contains an index that exceeds the bounds of the vector, it results in an out-of-bounds read. This vulnerability can be triggered in the function `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_vertex() vh->sfaces_last()`.
- **Type Confusion:** Due to the ability to set object members to arbitrary memory locations via out-of-bounds reads, this could lead to type confusion when these objects are later dereferenced

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** The out-of-bounds read, combined with the type confusion, can lead to arbitrary code execution. By controlling the contents of the crafted `.nef3` file, an attacker could potentially overwrite parts of memory, causing a crash or potentially executing malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted, malformed `.nef3` file. This file, when processed by CGAL, triggers the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the capability to provide a malicious `.nef3` file to an application or system that uses the vulnerable CGAL library to parse the file. The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the system.

**Specific Details for CVE-2020-28617:**
- `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_vertex() vh->sfaces_last()`  - The vulnerability is triggered when reading vertex data and assigning the `sfaces_last()` member to a value outside the bounds of the SFace_of vector.

This vulnerability is one of many discovered in the CGAL library related to parsing malformed Nef polygon data. All of the vulnerabilities share a similar root cause of missing bounds checking.
