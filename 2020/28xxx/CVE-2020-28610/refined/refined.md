{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2020-28610",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of index validation when parsing Nef polygon data, specifically within the `SM_io_parser<Decorator_>::read_vertex()` function in `Nef_S2/SM_io_parser.h`. This leads to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `SFace_of` vector.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution due to the out-of-bounds read and type confusion when parsing a specially crafted malformed file.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a malicious input file containing crafted Nef polygon data to the vulnerable application, triggering the out-of-bounds read during parsing.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed input file to an application using the vulnerable CGAL library. No special privileges or access are required beyond this capability."
