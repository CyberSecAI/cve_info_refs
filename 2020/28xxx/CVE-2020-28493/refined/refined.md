{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `urlize` filter in Jinja2 uses an inefficient regular expression (`_punctuation_re`) with multiple wildcards, particularly the trailing punctuation wildcard, which can lead to excessive backtracking and high CPU consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)",
      "Inefficient regular expression with multiple wildcards causing catastrophic backtracking"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending crafted input to the `urlize` filter, leading to excessive CPU consumption and making the system unavailable to legitimate users.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network: The vulnerable component is accessible over the network."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to send crafted input to the `urlize` filter, potentially remotely."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Versions of the `jinja2` package before 2.11.3"
  ],
  "fix_versions": [
    "Version 2.11.3 and later of the `jinja2` package"
  ],
  "additional_info": {
     "poc": "A proof of concept is provided that shows how the processing time increases exponentially with specific input patterns. The vulnerability can be triggered by providing long strings with specific patterns of characters to the `urlize` filter.",
     "mitigation": "The issue can be mitigated by using Markdown instead of the urlize filter, implementing request timeouts or limiting process memory."
