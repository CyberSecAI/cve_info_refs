Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `djv` package was vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to its improper handling of template strings within JSON schemas. Specifically, the `template` function in `lib/utils/template.js` was vulnerable to code injection. By crafting a malicious schema with code embedded in string values that are used in the template function, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server or client where the vulnerable `djv` package is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of input strings used in the `template` function, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Insecure Template Function:** The `template` function within the djv library was directly executing code embedded within schema strings, without any sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim machine.
*   **Full System Compromise:** RCE could lead to complete control over the affected system, allowing attackers to steal sensitive information, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS scores highlight that all three aspects are severely impacted (High).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network. An attacker does not need local access to the system.
*   **Schema Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the JSON schema that is being validated by the vulnerable `djv` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious Schema:** The attacker must be able to supply the vulnerable application with a malicious JSON schema that contains the injected code within the `minItems` property of an array type as shown in the provided proof of concept (POC).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Proof of Concept (POC) Provided:** The content includes a clear POC demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed by upgrading `djv` to version 2.1.4 or higher. The fix implemented a sanitization function to remove potentially dangerous characters from user supplied string values.
*   **CVSS Score:** Both Snyk and NVD assigned a critical CVSS score of 9.8.

**In summary,** CVE-2020-28464 is a critical RCE vulnerability in the `djv` package that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious JavaScript into JSON schema values that are used unsafely in the template function. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and requires no authentication. Upgrading to version 2.1.4 or higher is necessary to mitigate this risk.
