Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of signature verification for shared libraries on PAX payment devices running ProlinOS. While the system enforces signature checks on executable files, it doesn't do so for libraries. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended security measures by injecting malicious code into a library and causing it to be executed by a signed application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Signature Checks on Libraries:** The core weakness is the absence of signature verification for shared libraries, while ELF executables are checked for signatures.
*   **Reliance on Userspace Signature Verification:** The system uses a userspace component (`installer` called by `xcbd`) for initial signature verification, and the kernel also performs checks through `/dev/verify`, but this only applies to executables.
*   **Executable Signature Bypass (not directly CVE-2020-28045 but related):** The signature scheme is known (RSA 2048 signature appended at the end of the file plus `SIGNED_VER:00001`).
*   **Writable Libraries by User:** Libraries used by user-installed applications are writable by the user that installed them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By replacing a legitimate library with a malicious one, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of any application using that library.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This can be used to escalate privileges to root, as demonstrated in the document, by injecting a library with a privilege escalation payload.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access via XCB:** The attacker can leverage the XCB service which allows pushing files to the device and can be accessed via serial or network, to replace a targeted shared library.
*   **`LD_PRELOAD`:** While `shell` functionality is not always available, the attack can be performed via `LD_PRELOAD` if the attacker has shell access or by directly replacing the library, as the exploit demonstrates.
*   **`xtables-multi`:** The exploit leverages the `xtables-multi` command with the `--modprobe` option in combination with replacing a shared library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Device via XCB (serial or network):** The attacker needs the ability to push files to the device through the XCB service.
*   **Ability to Identify a Shared Library:** The attacker needs to identify a shared library used by a signed application.
*   **Ability to Write Files to `/data/app/MAINAPP/lib/`:** The attacker needs to be able to overwrite the target shared library with a malicious one.
*   **Ability to Trigger the Signed Application:** The attacker needs to trigger the execution of the signed application that will load the malicious library.

**Additional Details**
* The exploit described in the document replaces `libsqlite3.so` in `/data/app/MAINAPP/lib/` which is used by `MablApp` which is located at `/data/app/MAINAPP/bin/`. The exploit is triggered by `xtables-multi` with the `--modprobe` option.
* The document also mentions that devices have three debug levels: 0, 1 and 2, where level 0 is the production level which does not have shell capabilities by default.
* The `installer` binary is responsible for verifying ELF files before they are executed. This is done via the `/dev/verify` device.
