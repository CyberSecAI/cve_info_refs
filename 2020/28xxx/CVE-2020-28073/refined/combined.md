### [Corrected the database name…](/comment/105818#comment-105818)

Corrected the database name from db\_onlinelibrary to db\_library in config.php
changed deprecated function\_\_autoload with newest function type spl\_autoload\_register,
changed database.php fromthis->magic\_quotes\_active = get\_magic\_quotes\_gpc() to $this->magic\_quotes\_active = false;
And everything was ok
