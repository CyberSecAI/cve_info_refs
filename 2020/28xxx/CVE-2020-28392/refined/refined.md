- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions are configured for the application folder and subfolders during installation to the default target folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure folder permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain persistence or potentially escalate privileges should a user with elevated credentials log onto the machine.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system and must be able to modify the affected folders. A user with elevated credentials needs to log onto the machine for privilege escalation.
