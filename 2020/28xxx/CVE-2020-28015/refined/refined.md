{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A newline character can be injected into the spool header file by crafting a recipient address that includes a newline character.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Newline injection",
    "Insufficient input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject new lines into the spool header file, which can lead to arbitrary command execution or information disclosure by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Exim parses the header file. This can lead to local privilege escalation to root.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can craft an email with a recipient address containing newline characters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access is required."
