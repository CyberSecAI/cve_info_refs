{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Barco wePresent firmware does not perform verification of digitally signed firmware updates.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of digital signature verification on firmware updates, allowing the installation of modified or malicious firmware.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify the firmware to gain control over the device, including the ability to reset the admin password and enable SSH access with a known root password.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to create a modified firmware image with a valid checksum, and then upload it to the device via the standard firmware update process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to upload a modified firmware image to the device. This may require administrative access to the web interface or physical access to the device."
