Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28351:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided GitHub repository clearly states that it's related to "CVE-2020-28351 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack in ShoreTel version 19.46.1802.0."
   - The provided description matches the information given in the content
   - This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - Insufficient validation of user-supplied input specifically within the `time_zone` object on the `HOME_MEETING&` page.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the application takes unsanitized input from the URL's `PATH_INFO` (specifically the `%22%20onmouseover=alert(document.domain)%20?page=HOME` part) and reflects it back within the HTML page of the web application in the mentioned dropdown menu object.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web application.
   - This allows the attacker to:
     - Steal session cookies.
     - Redirect users to malicious sites.
     - Deface the website.
     - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
     - Other malicious actions limited by browser sandbox and same-origin policies

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that injects malicious JavaScript code within the `PATH_INFO` to `index.php`. The vulnerable page is the one related to `HOME_MEETINGS&` page.
   - **User Interaction:** The malicious payload is triggered when a user hovers the mouse over the time\_zone dropdown object.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **No Authentication Required**: The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Social Engineering**: An attacker has to trick the user into clicking a malicious link. This could be done through email, IM, or other ways of delivering the malicious URL to the intended victim.
   - **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the user a crafted URL that will be opened in the browser

**Additional Details from the provided information:**

*   The provided content in the GitHub repo includes images of the vulnerable code and a screenshot of the Burp Suite request for the vulnerable request

In summary, CVE-2020-28351 is a reflected XSS vulnerability in ShoreTel version 19.46.1802.0 that an unauthenticated attacker could exploit by crafting a URL with a malicious payload, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution when a user interacts with the vulnerable element.
