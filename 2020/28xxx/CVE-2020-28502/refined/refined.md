Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input within the `xhr.send` method when synchronous requests (`async=False` in `xhr.open`) are used. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Injection:** Malicious input passed to the `xhr.send` method is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Synchronous Request Requirement:** The vulnerability is triggered specifically when synchronous requests are used with `xhr.open`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Total Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially access all resources within the impacted component.
*   **Total Loss of Integrity:** An attacker can potentially modify any/all files protected by the impacted component.
*   **Total Loss of Availability:** An attacker can potentially deny access to resources within the impacted component, causing a sustained or persistent loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is exposed through the network, and attackers can potentially exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any user interaction.
*   **Ability to Send Crafted Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable component, specifically crafting the input to `xhr.send` to include malicious code.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects `xmlhttprequest-ssl` versions prior to 1.6.2 and `org.webjars.npm:xmlhttprequest` prior to version 1.8.0 and  `org.webjars.npm:xmlhttprequest-ssl` versions prior to 2.0.0
*   The vulnerability is present in a fork of the original `xmlhttprequest` library.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by using synchronous requests (`async=False`) in the `xhr.open` method and injecting code through the `xhr.send` method
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit is available and demonstrates how to inject malicious code via `xhr.send`. The POC includes javascript that writes a file to the system.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code)

**CVSS Scores:**

*   CVSS v3.1 score: 8.1 (High)
*   Attack Vector: Network
*   Attack Complexity: High
*   Privileges Required: None
*   User Interaction: None
*   Scope: Unchanged
*   Confidentiality: High
*   Integrity: High
*   Availability: High
