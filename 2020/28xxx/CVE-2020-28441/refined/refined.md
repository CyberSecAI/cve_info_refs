Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28441:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue in the `conf-cfg-ini` package. It stems from how the `decode` function parses INI files, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsafe handling of user-supplied input (INI file content).
- Lack of sanitization or validation of keys, allowing the use of `__proto__` as a key in the INI structure.
- The `decode` function does not prevent writing to the `__proto__` property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values (e.g. non-function where a function is expected), an attacker can cause exceptions and disrupt the application's functionality.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios where the code evaluates a property of an object using `eval`, an attacker can potentially inject malicious code for execution.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can overwrite properties that the application logic relies upon, including security-related properties, leading to privilege escalation or other unintended behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker provides a specially crafted INI file to an application that uses the vulnerable `conf-cfg-ini` package and its `decode` function.
- The attacker controls the content of the INI file and specifically uses the `__proto__` key to inject properties into the prototype of base objects in the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or influence the content of INI files being processed by the vulnerable `decode` function of the `conf-cfg-ini` library. This could involve direct file uploads, manipulating configuration file paths, or similar means.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `conf-cfg-ini` versions prior to 1.2.2.
- The fix involves preventing the `decode` function from processing keys that match protected properties such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the prototype by using a payload containing `[__proto__]\npolluted=polluted`.

The Snyk vulnerability report includes a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.3 (High) and an NVD score of 9.8 (Critical). Snyk also mentions that a PoC is available.
