Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28970:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure upload endpoint within the My Cloud OS. Specifically, an authenticated administrator could upload executable PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure file upload: The system allowed uploading of PHP files through an authenticated channel.
- Lack of input validation: The system did not properly validate or restrict the type of files being uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By uploading and executing malicious PHP scripts, an attacker could gain control over the device, potentially leading to data breaches, malware infections, or complete system compromise.
- The vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code in the context of root

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: An attacker would need network access to the affected device.
- Authenticated User: The attacker would need to have valid admin credentials to upload the malicious file. The ZDI advisory notes that authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable device
- Valid administrative credentials on the device

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by removing the vulnerable upload endpoint in firmware version 5.06.115.
- The vulnerability was reported by Sam Thomas (@_s_n_t) of Pentest Ltd (@pentestltd).
- The advisory also mentions another vulnerability which allows for authentication bypass on the nasAdmin service.
