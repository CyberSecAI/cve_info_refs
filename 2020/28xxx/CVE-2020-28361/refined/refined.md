Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a third-party module (SER) used in Sippy Softswitch for handling SIP signaling. The SER module has a flaw that allows for SIP header injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SIP Header Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious or manipulated SIP headers into SIP messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Toll Fraud:** Attackers could potentially manipulate call routing or billing information to commit toll fraud.
- **Caller-ID Spoofing:** Attackers could alter the caller ID information displayed to recipients.
- **Authentication Bypass:**  Attackers could bypass call authentication systems, enabling unauthorized traffic.
- **Manipulation of CDR Data and Billing Records:** Modification of SIP headers can lead to altered call detail records and incorrect billing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through manipulation of SIP headers within SIP messages.
- The attack vector is network-based, targeting the SIP signaling processing within the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to the affected system.
- No specific information is given about the required capabilities to inject the header, but it could require some understanding of SIP protocol and the underlying system configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability impacts Sippy Softswitch versions using SER for SIP signaling. Sippy Softswitch versions using OpenSIPS are not affected.
- A patch was made available for all affected production versions.
- The content provides more detail than the CVE description, including the specific impact, affected versions, and mitigation steps.
