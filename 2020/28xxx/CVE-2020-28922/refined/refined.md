{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `PCADRVX64.sys` kernel driver, distributed with the PC Analyser application, exposes IOCTL functionalities that allow low-privilege users to directly read and write arbitrary physical memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The kernel driver lacks proper access control, allowing unprivileged user-mode programs to interact with IOCTL codes designed for privileged operations.",
      "The vulnerable IOCTLs allow for reading and writing to arbitrary physical memory locations which can be leveraged for various malicious operations."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary Ring-0 code execution and privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability using the IOCTL interface of the vulnerable driver. A low-privilege user-mode program can send crafted IOCTL requests to the driver to read or write to arbitrary physical memory.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system. The vulnerable driver needs to be loaded before the exploit can occur; otherwise, the attacker would need admin rights to load the driver. Once the driver is loaded, the attacker only needs low-privilege access."
