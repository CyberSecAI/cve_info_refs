- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of array indices when loading and triangulating 3D models using the tinyobjloader library. Specifically, the `exportGroupsToShape` function does not prevent negative indices from being added to the `shape->mesh.indices` vector. This occurs even after checking that the indices are within the range of the vertex data, but simply continuing on to the next face group without aborting the process. 
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index**: The code fails to properly validate array indices used to access vertex data, leading to out-of-bounds access.
    - **Out-of-bounds Read**: The vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `attrib.vertices`, `attrib.normals`, or `attrib.texcoords` arrays using the invalid indices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a crash (Denial of Service) due to the out-of-bounds read. In a worst-case scenario, it could potentially lead to code execution, depending on how the values are used.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted `.obj` file that contains negative indices in the face definitions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted `.obj` file to an application using the vulnerable `tinyobjloader` library. This could be achieved by tricking a user into loading the malicious file, or if the application loads external files without proper sanitization.
