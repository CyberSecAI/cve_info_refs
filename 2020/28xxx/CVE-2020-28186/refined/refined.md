Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-28186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Forget Password" functionality in TerraMaster TOS is vulnerable to email injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Email Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the email address provided in the password reset request, allowing an attacker to inject additional email addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** By injecting an attacker-controlled email address into the password reset process, an attacker can receive the verification code along with the legitimate user. This allows the attacker to reset the user's password and gain full access to the account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints of the web interface.
*   The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the TerraMaster TOS device.
*   **Knowledge of Usernames:** The attacker needs to know a valid username that has a "security email" set up. This can be discovered by exploiting CVE-2020-28185 (User Enumeration), which is often done in combination with this exploit.
*   **Ability to Intercept Email:** The attacker needs to be able to access the verification code sent to their injected email address.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit involves the following steps:

1.  **User Enumeration (CVE-2020-28185):** Identify a valid user with a security email via a request to `/wizard/initialise.php` with `tab=checkuser&username=[username]`.
2.  **Email Injection (CVE-2020-28186):** Send a password reset request to `/wizard/initialise.php` with `tab=validmail&email=[valid_user@email],[attacker_controlled@email]`. Both emails receive the verification code.
3.  **Verification Code Validation:** Send the verification code (case insensitive) to `/wizard/initialise.php` with `tab=checkcode&code=[verification_code]`, the cookie value must be in lowercase.
4.  **Password Reset:** Reset the password using `/wizard/initialise.php` with `tab=checkpass&username=[username]&email=[valid_user@email]&code=[verification_code]&passwd=[new_password]`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability requires the target user to have specified a 'Security email' on their account.
*   This vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities found in TerraMaster TOS version 4.2.06 and fixed in version 4.2.07
