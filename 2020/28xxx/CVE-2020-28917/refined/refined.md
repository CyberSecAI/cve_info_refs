- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "View frontend statistics" extension saves all GET and POST data from TYPO3 frontend requests to the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive Data Exposure. The extension stores all request parameters in the database, which could include sensitive information such as passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could gain access to sensitive data like plain text passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. By sending requests to a vulnerable TYPO3 frontend, attackers could potentially have their sensitive data captured and stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the TYPO3 frontend. Additionally, they might require some level of access to the database where the data is being stored, although this is not explicit.
