## Description

This plugin allows you to quickly create child themes from any theme that you have currently installed on your site/blog.

It also creates rtl.css if exists in the parent theme.

**Did you find this plugin helpful? Please consider [writing a review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/orbisius-child-theme-creator)**

\*\* [Live Demo](https://wpdemo.net/demos/plugins/orbisius-child-theme-creator)\*\*

#### Child Theme Creator Features

* Since v1.4 store your snippets, license keys in Orbisius cloud library. Access them with a click of a button.
* Create a theme with a click of a button
* Uses the recommended approach for loading css (since v.1.3.4)
* Never forget what files to copy and what to skip when creating child themes.
* Copies parent theme’s options (since v.1.3)
* Easy to use interface
* When moving through the themes the currently looked one will have a nice background & border
* Create *unlimited* child themes from a parent theme. The plugin will add Child 01, Child 02 etc.
* Edit theme files with our two theme editors.
* Automatically creates rtl.css if it exists in the parent theme
* The plugin uses minified css/js to make sure it loads quicker.
* Copy files from one theme to another (Since v1.5.2)

This plugin allows you to quickly edit theme files from Appearance > Orbisius Theme Editor (entry added by the same plugin)

It features two editors and you can pick snippets from one theme and paste into another.

#### Theme Editor Features

* Edit two theme files at the same time
* Ajax -> No page refresh
* Easy to use interface
* Supports WordPress Multisite
* Create a New File (+ checks if the file exists)
* Delete file
* Respects the DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT constant, which if set to true will disable the Theme editor

* Since (v1.1.3) Send selected theme and parent theme (if any) to yourself or a colleague.
* Since (v1.1.3) Implemented theme files to be listed recursively (i.e. all files from the selected theme)
* Since (v1.1.9) Both editors have the same buttons (in older versions only the left editor had all of the buttons).
* Since (v1.2.2) Can create a blank functions.php file (Thanks Tobias Kaupat for the suggestion)
* Since (v1.3.5)\* Users can create new files in non-existing folders e.g. headers/header-two.php

#### Important Reasons to Create Child Themes

* Keep your changes when the parent theme is updated.
* Reduce duplicated code i.e. you need to copy and customize only the files that need to be customized
* Child Themes are often very small in size and can easily be shared and used for another project.
* Lots of cool and professional people do it
* … and a lot more

## Installation

1. Unzip the package, and upload `orbisius-child-theme-creator` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

## FAQ

### How to change Child thme screenshot?

currently, only via ftp.

### How to use this plugin?

Just install the plugin and activate it. Then go to Admin > Appearance > Orbisius Child Theme Creator.

Then click on a theme and the plugin will create a child theme for you.

### After my child theme is created can I remove the plugin safely?

Yes, you can, however, the plugin comes with a double editor which is pretty awesome.

It allows you to copy and paste from one theme to another without changing screens.

### How to disable Orbisius Theme Editor Plugin?

Just put this line right after the first <?php tag in the wp-config.php. This will also remove the WordPress’ Theme/Plugin editors as well.

define(‘DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT’, true);

### How to edit a logo or colours?

The theme should have an option to do that.

Please, check the customizer or within the admin area for a menu that matches the theme’s name.

Our plugin doesn’t know how each theme works so it’s better to direct those kind of questions to the theme designer.

### The child theme is created but doesn’t have some styles or doesn’t show the admin panel of the parent theme

OK. Please contact the theme author if his/her theme is child theme friendly.

Also which files does the theme need in order to work well.

### My Site is Broken

!@$@!$. Ok. Calm down. When you created the theme did you click on copy functions.php from advanced options?

Ok. You’ll need to use FTP client and go to in the wordpress folder and then wp-content/themes/AAAAA-child-01/ and delete functions.php

AAAAA is of course the directory of your parent theme.

### I want to be able to copy functions.php

Please use Orbisius Theme Editor (part of this plugin)

### Troubleshooting

If your site becomes broken due to a child theme (mis)configuration. Please check another plugin of ours:

I’ve tried only a couple of child theme creator plug-ins because I’m running on Local by Flywheel and the others wigged out. This one not only installed and ran, but gave me some super-nice editing options. Very impressive.

# High Severity Vulnerability Patched in Child Theme Creator by Orbisius

On September 9, 2020, our Threat Intelligence team discovered a vulnerability in [Child Theme Creator by Orbisius](https://wordpress.org/plugins/orbisius-child-theme-creator/), a WordPress plugin installed on over 30,000 sites. This flaw gave attackers the ability to forge requests on behalf of an administrator in order to modify arbitrary theme files and create new PHP files, which could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on a vulnerable site’s server.

We initially reached out to the plugin’s developer on September 9th, 2020. After establishing an appropriate communication channel, we provided the full disclosure details on September 10, 2020. The developer provided us with a copy of the intended patch on September 11, 2020 for us to test. We confirmed the patch fixed the vulnerability on September 11, 2020, and the plugin’s developer released the patch for the product on September 30, 2020.

We highly recommend updating to the patched version, 1.5.2, immediately.

Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule to protect against any exploits targeting this vulnerability on September 9, 2020. Sites still using the free version of Wordfence received the same protection on October 9, 2020.

**Description**: Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Modification and Creation

**Affected Plugin:** [Child Theme Creator by Orbisius](https://wordpress.org/plugins/orbisius-child-theme-creator/)

**Plugin Slug:** orbisius-child-theme-creator

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.5.1

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-28649](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28649)

**CVSS Score:** 8.8 (HIGH)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 1.5.2

Child Theme Creator by Orbisius is a plugin designed to create child themes. It also has a theme editor built into the plugin for easy editing of any newly created child themes.

The plugin uses an AJAX action to trigger the theme editor functions that are used to perform actions like loading a file, saving a file, and deleting a file which are all registered as subcommands via the ‘`sub_cmd`’ parameter.

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_ajax', 'orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_ajax');
add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_ajax', 'orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_no_auth_ajax');
```
```
/**
 * This is called via ajax. Depending on the sub_cmd param a different method will be called.
 */
function orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_ajax() {
    $buff = 'INVALID AJAX SUB_CMD';

    $req = orbisius_child_theme_creator_get_request();
    $sub_cmd = empty($req['sub_cmd']) ? '' : $req['sub_cmd'];

    switch ($sub_cmd) {
        case 'generate_dropdown':
            $buff = orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_generate_dropdown();

            break;

        case 'load_file':
            $buff = orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file(1);
            break;

        case 'save_file':
            $buff = orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file(2);

            break;

        case 'delete_file':
            $buff = orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file(3);

            break;

        case 'syntax_check':
            $buff = orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file(4);

            break;

        case 'send_theme':
            $buff = orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file(5);

            break;

        default:
            break;
    }

    die($buff);
```

The `orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file` function tied to the each ‘`sub_cmd`’ value did have a capability check, however, it was missing any form of Cross-Site Request Forgery protection.

```
 function orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file( $cmd_id = 1 ) {
  if ( ! current_user_can( 'edit_themes' ) ) {
        return 'Missing data!';
    }
```

This meant that if attackers could get a site administrator to click on a link or perform an action, then an attacker could use the `orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file` function tied to the AJAX action to upload an arbitrary file to the site’s theme directory, or modify any existing theme files to inject malicious code and create a webshell or backdoor.

Once an attacker uploads a backdoor or webshell, they could maintain persistence on the WordPress site and server as well as execute arbitrary commands to escalate their privileges.

## Recommended Procedure for Utility Plugins

Child Theme Creator by Orbisius falls into a category of utility plugins that are rarely used more than a few times, and are not required for the front-end functionality of the site. These utility plugins, such as file managers, child theme creators, site duplicators, or database optimization utilities, are only useful for a short time to allow a site administrator to perform a specific action, but these plugins provide no useful functionality for site visitors.

The less code you leave on your WordPress site, whether themes or plugins, the less you have to maintain. Also, less code on your WordPress site leaves fewer possibilities for vulnerabilities that could put your site at risk. As such, we recommend that you only install utility plugins on your site when you need to perform a specific action and, as a general rule, remove those plugins completely from your site when they are not in use in order to keep your site safe.

## Disclosure Timeline

**September 9, 2020 –** Initial discovery of the vulnerability. We develop a firewall rule to protect Wordfence customers and release it. Wordfence Premium users receive this rule. We make our initial contact attempt with the plugin’s developer.

**September 10, 2020 –** The plugin’s developer confirms the inbox for handling discussion. We send over full disclosure.

**September 11, 2020 –** The plugin’s developer confirms the vulnerability and provides us with a patched copy to verify the fixes. We confirm the fixes the same day.

**September 22, 2020 –** Follow-up to confirm when the fix will be released to the WordPress repository. The plugin’s developer responds the same day confirming that the fix will be released that week.

**September 30, 2020 –** The patch is released in version 1.5.2.

**October 9, 2020 –** Free Wordfence users receive firewall rule.

## Conclusion

In today’s post, we detailed a flaw in Child Theme Creator by Orbisius that granted attackers the ability to upload arbitrary files and modify existing theme files, which could be used to achieve remote code execution. This flaw has been fully patched in version 1.5.2. We recommend that users immediately update to the latest version available, which is version 1.5.2 at the time of this publication.

Both sites using [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20201014&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) and those still using the free version of Wordfence are protected from attacks against this vulnerability. Wordfence Premium users received this protection on September 10, 2020 while those still using the free version of Wordfence received the same protection on October 10, 2020.

If you know a friend or colleague who is using this plugin on their site, we highly recommend forwarding this advisory to them to help keep their sites protected as this is a high severity security update.

* Copy files from one theme to another (Since v1.5.2)

This plugin allows you to quickly edit theme files from Appearance > Orbisius Theme Editor (entry added by the same plugin)

It features two editors and you can pick snippets from one theme and paste into another.

#### Theme Editor Features

* Edit two theme files at the same time
* Ajax -> No page refresh

## Installation

1. Unzip the package, and upload `orbisius-child-theme-creator` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

## FAQ

### How to change Child thme screenshot?

currently, only via ftp.

### How to use this plugin?

Just install the plugin and activate it. Then go to Admin > Appearance > Orbisius Child Theme Creator.

Then click on a theme and the plugin will create a child theme for you.

### After my child theme is created can I remove the plugin safely?

Yes, you can, however, the plugin comes with a double editor which is pretty awesome.

It allows you to copy and paste from one theme to another without changing screens.

### How to disable Orbisius Theme Editor Plugin?

Just put this line right after the first <?php tag in the wp-config.php. This will also remove the WordPress’ Theme/Plugin editors as well.

define(‘DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT’, true);

### How to edit a logo or colours?

The theme should have an option to do that.

Please, check the customizer or within the admin area for a menu that matches the theme’s name.

Our plugin doesn’t know how each theme works so it’s better to direct those kind of questions to the theme designer.

### The child theme is created but doesn’t have some styles or doesn’t show the admin panel of the parent theme

OK. Please contact the theme author if his/her theme is child theme friendly.

Also which files does the theme need in order to work well.

### My Site is Broken

!@$@!$. Ok. Calm down. When you created the theme did you click on copy functions.php from advanced options?

Ok. You’ll need to use FTP client and go to in the wordpress folder and then wp-content/themes/AAAAA-child-01/ and delete functions.php

AAAAA is of course the directory of your parent theme.

### I want to be able to copy functions.php

Please use Orbisius Theme Editor (part of this plugin)

### Troubleshooting

If your site becomes broken due to a child theme (mis)configuration. Please check another plugin of ours:

I use Child Theme Creator by Orbisius on every WP website.
It’s never failed with Divi, Kadence, Avada, and other themes.
My method:
1. Install the theme
2. Activate Child Theme Creator by Orbisius
3. Create child theme
4. Test theme
5. Deactivate\* Child Theme Creator by Orbisius
6. (optional\*) delete Child Theme Creator by Orbisius
\* Keep the plugin installed and/or active if you know you will be changing/testing themes

I’ve tried only a couple of child theme creator plug-ins because I’m running on Local by Flywheel and the others wigged out. This one not only installed and ran, but gave me some super-nice editing options. Very impressive.
