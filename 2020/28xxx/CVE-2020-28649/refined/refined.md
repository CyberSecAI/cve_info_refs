The content is related to CVE-2020-28649.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin's AJAX action `orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_ajax` which is used for theme file management operations (load, save, delete etc.) lacked CSRF protection. The function `orbisius_ctc_theme_editor_manage_file` checks if the user has the `edit_themes` capability but does not validate the request origin or include a nonce.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Arbitrary File Modification
- Arbitrary File Creation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions by crafting malicious requests.
- This could allow them to upload arbitrary files to the site's theme directory or modify existing files.
- Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the server by injecting malicious code into theme files, creating backdoors or webshells.
- Full control of the WordPress site and potentially the server.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attack vector is a crafted malicious link or action that a site administrator is tricked into clicking or performing while logged in. This could be achieved through phishing or other social engineering tactics.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to perform an action that triggers the vulnerable AJAX request.
- No special privileges are needed on the target system, but the attacker must be able to make the administrator execute the malicious request.
