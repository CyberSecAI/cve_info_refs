  "response": {
    "cve": "CVE-2020-28874",
    "extracted_information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the reset password component where the backend does not properly clean the `$user_data` variable after retrieving user data based on a provided username. Consequently, the system proceeds with the password reset process even with an invalid token if a valid username is supplied.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation and sanitization. Specifically, the lack of validation on the token parameter and failure to clear `$user_data` when the token is invalid.",
        "Incorrect business logic in the reset password flow, leading to bypassing of token validation."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can reset the password of any user, including administrators, by exploiting the vulnerability, gaining unauthorized access to the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a POST request to the `reset-password.php` endpoint.",
         "Including an invalid `token` parameter in the query string.",
        "Specifying the target user's username in the `user` parameter in the query string.",
        "Providing a valid CSRF token, typically extracted from the login form.",
        "Setting the `form_type` parameter to `new_password` in the POST body.",
        "Including the attacker's desired new password in the `password` parameter in the POST body."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and must know a valid username, such as admin, for which they want to reset the password. They also need a valid CSRF token from the login form, but not necessarily need valid credentials. The attacker does not need any other privileges or specific access to the system or network."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, its root cause, and the exploitation process. It also provides a python script and a docker setup for testing the vulnerability, along with instructions on how to reproduce the attack. This gives much more detail than the CVE description alone."
