Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection within the `akka-http-session` library. The `randomTokenCsrfProtection` check only verifies if the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header and the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie values are equal and non-empty. It does not ensure the token's uniqueness, unpredictability, or association with a specific user session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient CSRF Protection:** The core weakness is that the CSRF protection mechanism can be bypassed.
*   **Lack of Token Validation:** The check only verifies equality and non-emptiness, rather than using a cryptographically secure method to generate and validate the CSRF token. This means that an attacker can trivially forge a valid CSRF token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF Attacks:** An attacker can forge requests on behalf of a user, potentially performing actions that the user did not intend to make.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** While the CVSS score indicates low impact on these individually, it should be noted that a successful CSRF attack can lead to data modification (integrity), unauthorized access to information (confidentiality), or denial of service (availability) depending on the application's functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network as the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to the system.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick a legitimate user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link) to trigger the attack. This action results in the user's browser sending a crafted request to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Willem Vermeer.
*   The fix involves implementing a HMAC-encoded CSRF token (as seen in the GitHub pull request #79).
*   Affected versions: `com.softwaremill.akka-http-session:core_2.11` versions `[0,)`,  `com.softwaremill.akka-http-session:core_2.12` versions `[0, 0.6.1)`, `com.softwaremill.akka-http-session:core_2.13` versions `[0, 0.6.1)`.
*   The fix is available in version 0.6.1 and later.
*   The Snyk vulnerability IDs are:
    *   `SNYK-JAVA-COMSOFTWAREMILLAKKAHTTPSESSION-1046675` for `core_2.11`
    *   `SNYK-JAVA-COMSOFTWAREMILLAKKAHTTPSESSION-1046674` for `core_2.12`
    *    `SNYK-JAVA-COMSOFTWAREMILLAKKAHTTPSESSION-1058933` for `core_2.13`
