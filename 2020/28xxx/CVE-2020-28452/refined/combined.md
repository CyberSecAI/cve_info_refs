EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 24 Nov 2020

[CVE-2020-28452  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-28452) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-352  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `com.softwaremill.akka-http-session:core_2.11`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF). CSRF protection can be bypassed by forging a request that contains the same value for both the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header and the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie value, as the check in `randomTokenCsrfProtection` only checks that the two values are equal and non-empty.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

### @willemvermeer **[willemvermeer](/willemvermeer)** commented [Dec 21, 2020](#issue-772146026)

Hi, this is a first iteration of a PR to resolve issue [#77](https://github.com/softwaremill/akka-http-session/issues/77)

I have provided a minimal implementation and am open to suggestions for improvement. For example, I decided to reuse the existing server secret to hash the timestamp, instead of defining a second server secret for this new purpose (personally I think it can do no harm to reuse the same server secret, but feel free to disagree, in which case we'll have to add config changes for an additional server secret).

Best,

Willem

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Description

![@willemvermeer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1078847?u=011316cf1fbc257e2d3890868ac5b5f6b4fc5b51&v=4&size=48)[willemvermeer](https://github.com/willemvermeer)opened [on Nov 24, 2020](https://github.com/softwaremill/akka-http-session/issues/77#issue-749877064)

Hi again,

Another question about the CSRF protection. It can be bypassed by forging a request that contains the same value for both the X-XSRF-TOKEN header and the XSRF-TOKEN cookie value. Any value will do since the only check that is now performed in randomTokenCsrfProtection is for those two values to be equal and non-empty.

Would it be somehow possible to conform to the OWASP recommendations described [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) what do you think would be the best approach?

Thanks,

Willem

[Report a new vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) [Found a mistake?](https://support.snyk.io/s/contactsupport)
#### Introduced: 24 Nov 2020

[CVE-2020-28452  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-28452) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-352  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `com.softwaremill.akka-http-session:core_2.12` to version 0.6.1 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF). CSRF protection can be bypassed by forging a request that contains the same value for both the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header and the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie value, as the check in `randomTokenCsrfProtection` only checks that the two values are equal and non-empty.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.
