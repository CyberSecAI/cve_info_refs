Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28042:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance**
The content directly relates to CVE-2020-28042. It describes a JWT signature verification bypass vulnerability in ServiceStack, which is the subject of the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `ServiceStack.EnumerableUtils.EquivalentTo` method used for comparing JWT signatures. This method does not check the length of the byte arrays being compared, and initializes the comparison to a successful state (`var compare = 0`). If the provided signature is an empty byte array (length 0), the loop will not execute and the method will return `true`, effectively bypassing signature verification.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **JWT Signature Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass JWT signature verification due to the flawed comparison logic.
- **Lack of Length Check:** The `EquivalentTo` method lacks a length check, which is essential for proper byte array comparison.
- **Initial Comparison Value:** The comparison variable is initialized to 0, which leads to a successful comparison if no actual comparison takes place.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can forge valid JWT tokens with arbitrary content by removing the signature, thereby bypassing authentication mechanisms.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By creating forged tokens, attackers can potentially elevate their privileges to access resources that they shouldn't be authorized to.
- **Arbitrary Content:** Attackers can embed arbitrary claims in the forged JWT tokens, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Tampered JWT:** The attack vector is a tampered JWT token that has its signature removed.
- **HTTP Requests:** The tampered token is sent within HTTP requests to authenticated API endpoints.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of JWT Structure:** An attacker needs to know the basic structure of a JWT (header, payload, signature).
- **Ability to Intercept/Modify Traffic:** An attacker needs the ability to intercept or modify HTTP requests to replace legitimate tokens with forged ones.
- **Access to System (Implicit):** The attacker must have access to system that leverages this library

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered internally by the ServiceStack development team, but was not clearly communicated in the release notes of v5.9.2, which only mentioned a "JWT signature verification issue".
- Shielder rediscovered the vulnerability during a penetration test and disclosed it publicly with an advisory and CVE assignment, because the vague release notes may not have highlighted the full impact of this vulnerability.
- The fix for the vulnerability was implemented in version 5.9.2 of ServiceStack by adding a null check and length check in the `EquivalentTo` method.
