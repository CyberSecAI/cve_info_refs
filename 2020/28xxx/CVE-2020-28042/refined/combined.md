# ServiceStack <=5.9.1 JWT Signature Verification Bypass

## Summary

ServiceStack is affected by a signature verification bypass in the `ServiceStack.Auth.JwtAuthProviderReader` method, which could be used to bypass the authentication mechanisms and/or to elevate privileges.

**This security advisory is referred to a vulnerability found and resolved internally by ServiceStack’s development team, read the “[Re-discovering a JWT Authentication Bypass in ServiceStack](/blog/2020/11/re-discovering-a-jwt-authentication-bypass-in-servicestack/)” for more information.**

## Product Description (from vendor)

“ServiceStack is an open-source framework designed to be an alternative to the WCF, ASP.NET MVC, and ASP.NET Web API frameworks. It supports REST and SOAP endpoints, autoconfiguration of data formats, inversion of control containers, object-relational mapping, caching mechanisms, and much more.” For more information visit <https://servicestack.net/>.

## CVE(s)

* [CVE-2020-28042](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28042)

## Details

### Root Cause Analysis

The verification of a `JWT` token consists of the server extracting the `header` and the `payload` of the token from a given request, re-calculating the signature server-side, and finally comparing the calculated signature with the one in the request through the `VerifyPayload` function.

The `VerifyPayload` function make usage of the following `ServiceStack.EnumerableUtils.EquivalentTo` method:

| ``` 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244  ``` | ``` public static bool EquivalentTo(this byte[] bytes, byte[] other)     {         var compare = 0;         for (var i = 0; i < other.Length; i++)             compare |= other[i] ^ bytes[i];         return compare == 0;     } ``` |
| --- | --- |

The method is called with the server-side generated signature as `bytes` and the request signature as `other`.
As no length check is performed and the check is pre-set to the success value (`var compare = 0`), it is possible to bypass the whole check by submitting an empty signature. If `other.Length` is `0` then no checks are performed and the function will always return `True`.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a web application that uses the ServiceStack JWT authentication provider before version 5.9.2.
2. Forge a valid token (or get one from the service).
3. Remove the signature from the token (e.g. `HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE` becomes `HEADER.PAYLOAD.`).
4. Sent the tampered token to an authenticated API and notice that the token is correctly validated.

### Impact

An attacker can forge a valid JWT token with arbitrary content.

### Remediation

Upgrade ServiceStack to version 5.9.2 or later.

## Why ServiceStack?

Simple, versatile, evolvable, resilient high-performance message-based APIs

[![App screenshot](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vae0ALalIP0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Vae0ALalIP0)

Maximize Value and Reach of System APIs
Most features are centered around ServiceStack APIs which has become the most versatile in the world where the same APIs
can be consumed from HTTP in a myriad of data formats, via popular MQ Servers whilst supporting
new technologies like gRPC without sacrificing any native HTTP integrations.

Ultimate Developer Productivity
ServiceStack makes it as simple as possible for API Consumers to call your APIs, with native end-to-end
typed integrations to 10 of the most popular languages used in creating Web, Mobile & Desktop Apps,
that they can easily add/update from within their favorite IDE.

Remote Services Best Practices
ServiceStack adopts a message-based design that embraces the SOA Integration Remote Facade, DTO and
Service Gateway patterns whose uniquely benefits ServiceStack as the only Services framework
to reuse API contracts enabling optimal end-to-end typed API integrations in .NET Apps without code-gen.

Benefits of message-based design
Unlike RPC, messages can be evolved, intercepted, routed & serialized with natural decoupling of an APIs coarse-grained DTO contracts allowing front & back-end developers to collaborate on an agreed high-level API design free of detail concerns for their independent implementations.

Consistent & Simplified Development Model
The benefit afforded by capturing an entire API boundary into impl-free Service Contracts extends to all natively supported languages who only need be concerned with generating declarative DTOs resulting in types encapsulating richer metadata beyond what's possible in other code-gen solutions.

Preserve Investments
ServiceStack has been consistently promoting the same remote service best-practices for over a decade, whose adoption of its time-tested patterns has survived beyond several abandoned .NET Web Service frameworks during its lifetime with any investments having failed along with them.

# Re-discovering a JWT Authentication Bypass in ServiceStack

### TL;DR

[ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net) before version 5.9.2 failed to properly verify JWT signatures, allowing to forge arbitrary tokens and bypass authentication/authorization mechanisms.
The vulnerability was [discovered and patched](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/commit/540d4060e877a03ae95343c1a8560a26768585ee) by the ServiceStack team [without highlighting the actual impact](https://docs.servicestack.net/jwt-authprovider#upgrade-to-v592), so we chose to publish this blog post along with an [advisory](/advisories/servicestack-jwt-signature-verification-bypass/).

## Routine checks –> Auth bypass

During a [Web Application Penetration Test](https://www.shielder.com/services/application-security/) for one of our customers, I noticed that after the login process through a 3rd-party Oauth service the web application used [JWT tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) to track sessions and privileges.

Every time I see JWT tokens, I have kind of a routine of tests I do to check for [common JWT libraries vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-vancouver/assets/presentations/2020-01_Attacking_and_Securing_JWT.pdf).
At some point, during the test, I tried to **remove the signature**, without changing the header and with my big surprise the authenticated API I was testing answered with a “[200 OK](https://http.cat/200)”.

My curiosity was over the top and I had to find a way to **read the source code** to understand what was going on. Unfortunately, it was a BlackBox test ð© but fortunately, it didn’t take much time to achieve **RCE** ð.

## A deep dive into the source code

My first guess was that the customer tried to parse the JWT token manually and failed to implement a proper check for `NULL` signatures.

After I went crazy reading a ton of lines of decompiled `C#` code I finally realized that the customer was using a 3rd-party library called [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net/). It was a matter to said it loudly and my fast typer mate [Paupu](https://twitter.com/Paupu_95) already Google’d it and a GitHub result showed up.

![Me and Paupu doing the happy dance](/img/blog/happy_dance.gif)

Me and Paupu doing the happy dance

## ~~0-day~~

By searching in the [source code](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack), we made a sad discovery: the developers were already aware of the issue and [fixed it in version 5.9.2](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/commit/540d4060e877a03ae95343c1a8560a26768585ee), just a month before our test. à²¥\_à²¥

At this point I was super confused, our customer had no other dependency with known vulnerabilities and it seemed to pay attention to security advisories in the used 3rd-party libraries. Maybe the vendor didn’t provide precise information about the vulnerability impact?

Reading the [v5.9.2 release notes](https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.9#v592-patch-release-notes) confirmed my assumption, the only information about the patch is:
*If youâre using JWT Auth please upgrade to v5.9.2 when possible to resolve a JWT signature verification issue.*

## So what’s the point here?

During one of our weekly team meetings, I shared this finding with my co-workers and we agreed that probably most of the developers were unaware of the actual risk of using ServiceStack before version 5.9.2 because no precise information about the vulnerability impact is publically disclosed. This was also confirmed by our customer during our final report presentation.

![](/img/blog/everything_is_fine.jpeg)

I then chose to write this blog post, to ask the MITRE to assign a CVE ([CVE-2020-28042](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28042)) to this vulnerability and to publish an [advisory](/advisories/servicestack-jwt-signature-verification-bypass/) which explains its technical aspects.

We always encourage releasing advisories about vulnerabilities in widely used libraries to help developers keeping their code secure and updated.

### v5.9.2 Patch Release

This patch release resolves a JWT signature verification issue, if you’re using JWT please upgrade to v5.9.2 when possible.

If you’re unable to upgrade to the latest version, older versions should ensure a minimum length signature with a custom `ValidateToken` , e.g:

```
new JwtAuthProvider(...) {
    ValidateToken = (js,req) =>
        req.GetJwtToken().LastRightPart('.').FromBase64UrlSafe().Length >= 32
}

```
### Group Services by Tag

We’ve extended the [Tag support in Open API](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/grouping-operations-with-tags/) to group related Services by annotating **Request DTOs** with the `[Tag]` attribute, e.g. you can use this to tag which Services are used by different platforms:

```
[Tag("web")]
public class WebApi : IReturn<MyResponse> {}

[Tag("mobile")]
public class MobileApi : IReturn<MyResponse> {}

[Tag("web"),Tag("mobile")]
public class WebAndMobileApi : IReturn<MyResponse> {}

```

Where they’ll now appear as a tab to additionally filter APIs in metadata pages:

Support for tags was also added to [Add ServiceStack Reference](https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference) where it can be used in the [IncludeTypes](https://docs.servicestack.net/csharp-add-servicestack-reference#includetypes) DTO customization option where tags can be specified using braces in the format `{tag}` or `{tag1,tag2,tag3}`, e.g:

```
/* Options:
IncludeTypes: {web,mobile}

```

Or individually:

```
/* Options:
IncludeTypes: {web},{mobile}

```

It works similar to [Dependent Type References wildcard syntax](https://docs.servicestack.net/csharp-add-servicestack-reference#include-request-dto-and-its-dependent-types) where it expands all Request DTOs with the tag to include all its reference types so including a `{web}` tag would be equivalent to including all Request DTOs & reference types with that reference, e.g:

```
/* Options:
IncludeTypes: WebApi.*,WebAndMobileApi.*

```
### AutoQuery AutoGen Customizations

AutoGen is our exciting feature to [Instantly Servicify existing Systems](https://docs.servicestack.net/servicify) by automatically generating the AutoQuery & Crud APIs and Data Models for all tables in the configured RDBMS’s.

We’ve extended the existing [Customizable Code Generation filters](https://docs.servicestack.net/autogen#customize-code-generation-to-include-app-conventions) to allow customization of the DataModel Name, the user-defined Route Path they’re hosted at & the name of individual AutoQuery APIs for each operation.

E.g. If you had an [existing table name called applications](https://forums.servicestack.net/t/autoquery-autocrud-extra-options/8706) the default convention based names would be:

* Data Model: Applications
* APIs: CreateApplications, PatchApplications, QueryApplications, etc
* Route: /applications, /applications/{Id}

You can change each of these default conventions with the new `GenerateOperationsFilter`, e.g:

```
Plugins.Add(new AutoQueryFeature {
    MaxLimit = 1000,
    GenerateCrudServices = new GenerateCrudServices {
        AutoRegister = true,
        GenerateOperationsFilter = ctx => {
            if (ctx.TableName == "applications")
            {
                ctx.DataModelName = "Application";
                ctx.RoutePathBase = "/apps";
                ctx.OperationNames = new Dictionary<string, string> {
                    [AutoCrudOperation.Create] = "CreateApp",
                    [AutoCrudOperation.Query] = "SearchApps",
                };
            }
        }
    }
});

```

Would result in:

* Data Model: Application
* APIs: CreateApp, PatchApplication, SearchApps
* Route: /apps, /apps/{Id}

### Dart Improvements

Added `ClientFactory` to enable [source-compatible Service Client instance creation](https://forums.servicestack.net/t/mixed-support-for-flutter-web-mobile-desktop/8699) where both Dart VM / Flutter `JsonServiceClient` and Dart Web `JsonWebClient` IServiceClient’s can be created with:

```
var client = ClientFactory.create();

```

Where you can use the same `initClient` lambda to configure all ServiceClients instances, e.g. you could configure them to use the same JWT Token with:

```
ClientConfig.initClient = (client) => client.bearerToken = "...";

```
### Ignore AutoCrud Properties

If you’re creating [Custom AutoQuery CRUD Services](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery-crud#custom-autoquery-crud-services) you can ignore & skip the validation of properties that don’t map to the Request’s Data Model individually annotating properties with the `[AutoIgnore]` Attribute, e.g:

```
public class CustomRockstarService
    : ICreateDb<Rockstar>, IReturn<RockstarWithIdResponse>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int? Age { get; set; }
    [AutoIgnore]
    public CustomInfo CustomInfo { get;set; }
}

```

Or you can ignore validation for all properties with the same name by registering it on `AutoQuery.IncludeCrudProperties` , e.g:

```
AutoQuery.IncludeCrudProperties.Add(nameof(CustomInfo));

```
### OrderBy Random

`OrderBy` includes special support for returning results in Random order using `Random`, e.g:

```
/rockstars?OrderBy=Random

```

Using Service Client:

```
client.Get(new QueryRockstars { OrderBy = "Random" });

```
#### Support for Naked Lists

Fixed an issue with [Release Builds in Flutter to support Naked Lists](https://forums.servicestack.net/t/dart-client-client-mapping-issue-in-release-build/8754), e.g:

```
class GetFoo : OrderedRequest, IReturn<List<FooDto>>

```

Unfortunately the Release Builds on Device returns a different `runtimeType.toString()` to Dart VM, to workaround this issue the `JsonConverters.TypeFactories` are populated with additional concrete Type mappings for all generic types.
