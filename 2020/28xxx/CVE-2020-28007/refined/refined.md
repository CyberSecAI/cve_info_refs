{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Exim operates as root in its log directory, which belongs to the \"exim\" user. It opens log files in append mode, using a format string derived from the configuration. An attacker with \"exim\" user privileges can create a symlink or hardlink in the log directory, leading to arbitrary file modification when the log file is written.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of log files by opening in append mode.",
      "Use of a format string that is potentially controllable via symlink."
     ],
    "impact": "Local Privilege Escalation from \"exim\" user to root. Arbitrary file contents can be appended, allowing for modification of system files like /etc/passwd and achieving root access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Creating symlinks or hardlinks in Exim's log directory (e.g., /var/log/exim4).",
      "Triggering a log write operation by sending an email."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker must have gained \"exim\" user privileges. This can be achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities in Exim such as CVE-2020-28020 or CVE-2020-28018."
