Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28276:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation within the `deepSet()` function of the `deep-set` NPM module. Specifically, the function doesn't check if a given property is an own property of the object before assigning a value to it. This allows an attacker to modify the object's prototype.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is that the `deepSet()` function can be exploited to add or modify properties on the `Object.prototype`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The function does not validate the property path, allowing access to the prototype via `__proto__`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By polluting the prototype, an attacker can potentially disrupt the normal behavior of applications using this library.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not directly stated as guaranteed, the vulnerability description indicates a potential for remote code execution by manipulating object properties, which could lead to RCE depending on how the polluted properties are later used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No specific privileges are required:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability without requiring any authentication or special privileges.
- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction, increasing its severity.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable function and path:** The attacker needs to know the `deepSet()` function is used and how to construct a malicious property path (e.g., using `__proto__`) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Function:** The `deepSet()` function within the `deep-set` module.
- **Vulnerable Versions:** 1.0.0 through 1.0.1 of the `deep-set` module.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC) Code:**
```javascript
var deepSet = require('deep-set')
var obj = {'1':'2'}  
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
deepSet(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', 'true');
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
```
This code snippet demonstrates how the `isAdmin` property is added to the `Object.prototype`, thus polluting it.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present because there is no validation to check if the assigned property is the object's own property.
- The vulnerable versions of the library are 1.0.0 through 1.0.1.
- There is currently no fix version available, but mitigation strategies are provided such as freezing the object or validating the JSON input.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical, with a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8.
