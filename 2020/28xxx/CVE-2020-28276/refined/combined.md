# CVE-2020-28276

#### Date: December 29, 2020

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in 'deep-set' versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.1 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module 'deep-set' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'deepSet()' does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as "true" as it had been polluted.

#### PoC Code

```
var deepSet = require('deep-set')
var obj = {'1':'2'}  console.log(obj.isAdmin);
deepSet(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', 'true');
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.7.0-4.0.0
#### Remediation

There are a couple of ways to mitigate prototype pollution vulnerabilities, for example: Most of the cases can be solved by freezing an object which doesn’t allow to add, remove, or change its properties. Validating the JSON input with shcema validation, this guarantees that the JSON input contains only predefined attributes. We can change the objects, so they won’t have any prototype association by using “Object.create”.
#### Prevention

No fix version

#### Language: JS

#### Good to know:

# CVE-2020-28276

#### Date: December 29, 2020

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in 'deep-set' versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.1 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module 'deep-set' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'deepSet()' does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as "true" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var deepSet = require('deep-set')
var obj = {'1':'2'}
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
deepSet(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', 'true')
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.7.0-4.0.0
#### Remediation

There are a couple of ways to mitigate prototype pollution vulnerabilities, for example: Most of the cases can be solved by freezing an object which doesn’t allow to add, remove, or change its properties. Validating the JSON input with shcema validation, this guarantees that the JSON input contains only predefined attributes. We can change the objects, so they won’t have any prototype association by using “Object.create”.
#### Prevention

No fix version

#### Language: JS

#### Good to know:

## Transform your program with proactive **application security**

### Automated dependency updates

Open source code has nearly always been updated by the time a vulnerability has been published, so automated dependency updates are one of the most effective methods available for eradicating vulnerabilities.

**83%**

Vulnerability reduction for teams that consistently update new versions within 48 hours of publication.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/platform-dependency-updates-1.svg)

### Complete visibility and control

A unified view that prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities and gives teams crucial information, control, and oversight to make smart decisions and deploy security policies at scale.

**85%**

Increase in real-time application visibility

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Complete-visibility-and-control.svg)

### Spotlight experience

To rapidly identify and mitigate high-risk vulnerabilities, developers must quickly narrow down what matters most—which means developers need an embedded experience that highlights what’s critical.

**3X**

Risk reduction; time to remediation is cut by 75 percent.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Spotlight-experience-platform-img.svg)

### Incredible scalability

Cutting through the complex sprawl of existing tools to centralize and scale deployment is crucial for consistent developer adoption and policy implementation.

**71 Days**

Of Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) – critical and high vulnerabilities

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1.png)

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Full-scale-automation-support-1.svg)

### Technical debt reduction

Avoid development roadblocks caused by an accumulation of technical debt from outdated dependencies.

Mend Renovate Enterprise’s scalable automation for dependency updates minimizes technical debt by ensuring dependencies are current across all repositories.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Technical-debt-reduction-5.svg)

### Merge Confidence ratings & workflows

Mend Renovate Enterprise lets you know the impact each dependency update will have on your application.

Merge Confidence ratings and workflows prevent updates from creating extra work, by providing the likelihood an update will pass without breaking your application and grouping these updates together.

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

## An approach to AppSec that helps developer **AND** security teams

Developer and security teams have the same AppSec destination—but they use different routes to get there. And when each team has fundamentally different needs, one tool will not fit all. That’s why we offer different—but complementary—solutions for each team.

# CVE-2020-28276

#### Date: December 29, 2020

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in 'deep-set' versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.1 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module 'deep-set' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'deepSet()' does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as "true" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
var deepSet = require('deep-set')
var obj = {'1':'2'}
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
deepSet(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', 'true')
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.7.0-4.0.0
#### Remediation

There are a couple of ways to mitigate prototype pollution vulnerabilities, for example: Most of the cases can be solved by freezing an object which doesn’t allow to add, remove, or change its properties. Validating the JSON input with shcema validation, this guarantees that the JSON input contains only predefined attributes. We can change the objects, so they won’t have any prototype association by using “Object.create”.
#### Prevention

No fix version

#### Language: JS

#### Good to know:

# CVE-2020-28276

#### Date: December 29, 2020

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in 'deep-set' versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.1 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module 'deep-set' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'deepSet()' does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.
#### PoC Details

Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as "true" as it had been polluted.

#### PoC Code

```
var deepSet = require('deep-set')
var obj = {'1':'2'}  console.log(obj.isAdmin);
deepSet(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', 'true');
console.log(obj.isAdmin);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.7.0-4.0.0
#### Remediation

There are a couple of ways to mitigate prototype pollution vulnerabilities, for example: Most of the cases can be solved by freezing an object which doesn’t allow to add, remove, or change its properties. Validating the JSON input with shcema validation, this guarantees that the JSON input contains only predefined attributes. We can change the objects, so they won’t have any prototype association by using “Object.create”.
#### Prevention

No fix version

#### Language: JS

#### Good to know:
