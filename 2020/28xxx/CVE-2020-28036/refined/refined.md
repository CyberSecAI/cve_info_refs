Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks within the `wp_newComment` function of WordPress's XML-RPC server (`wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php`). Specifically, the checks were not adequately verifying if a user had the necessary privileges to comment on a specific post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to post comments on posts they normally wouldn't have permission to, potentially bypassing content restrictions.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The XML-RPC interface allowed comment submissions without properly verifying user permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Comments:** Attackers could post comments as if they had higher privileges than they actually possess.
- **Potential Content Manipulation:** Depending on the post types, this could allow for manipulation of content or spreading of malicious messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XML-RPC Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through WordPress's XML-RPC interface.
- **`wp_newComment` Method:** The specific function used to exploit the vulnerability is the `wp_newComment` XML-RPC method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site with the XML-RPC interface enabled.
- **XML-RPC Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to make requests via XML-RPC.
- **User Account (Optional):**  While a user account is not always necessary, the vulnerability impacts the privilege checks for comments. Even anonymous users can potentially exploit if their access control is incorrectly handled.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided code diffs show the implemented fix, which adds additional permission checks before allowing a comment to be created via XML-RPC. These checks include verifying if the user has the ability to edit a published post or read a private post.
- The bugzilla entries confirm the vulnerability and the fix, as well as its impact.
- The Fedora mailing list confirms that this vulnerability was fixed in the wordpress package for Fedora distributions.
- The wordpress.org security release notes confirm the issue and acknowledge the reporters.
- The debian mailing list confirms that this vulnerability was fixed in the wordpress package for Debian distributions.

In summary, CVE-2020-28036 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in WordPress that allows attackers to bypass permission checks and post comments they otherwise would not be authorized to make by leveraging the XML-RPC interface.
