Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28448

**Root Cause:** Prototype pollution vulnerability in the `multi-ini` package. The vulnerability stems from the package's parsing logic that allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects by using the `__proto__` property in the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the `Object.prototype` by injecting properties using the `__proto__` key. This is a well-known vulnerability pattern in JavaScript. Specifically, the `multi-ini` package doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input, leading to the pollution of the prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions and disrupt the application. For example, modifying `toString` to an integer type will cause the application to fail.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific cases, if the application evaluates an attribute of an object (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), the attacker could pollute the prototype with malicious code and gain remote code execution.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can modify properties that the codebase relies on, including security properties such as admin flags, cookies or tokens. For example, if `someuser.isAdmin` is checked and the `isAdmin` is set to `true` on the `Object.prototype`, the attacker can get admin privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through a malicious input file (`payload.ini`) that contains the `__proto__` key.
*   The `multi-ini` library reads the malicious file and parses it, leading to prototype pollution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to provide the input file to be parsed by the vulnerable `multi-ini` package. This often means controlling a file path or input to the application that uses `multi-ini`.
* No specific privileges are required, only that the attacker can control the input to the `multi-ini` package.
* No user interaction is required.

**Technical Details:**
* The provided PoC demonstrates how the `__proto__` property can be used within an INI file to inject properties into the prototype of the `Object` class.
*  The vulnerability occurs when parsing input similar to:

  ```ini
  [__proto__]
  polluted = "polluted"
  ```

*  This results in the `polluted` property being added to `Object.prototype`, which affects all objects in the JavaScript application.
* The fix implemented was to ignore `__proto__` in sections and keys during parsing.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Versions of `multi-ini` prior to 2.1.1 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade `multi-ini` to version 2.1.1 or higher.
*   Other general mitigations against prototype pollution include freezing the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`, using schema validation of JSON input, and using objects without prototypes (e.g., `Object.create(null)`).

**CVSS Score:**
* Snyk has a CVSS score of 5.6 (Medium).
* NVD has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical)
