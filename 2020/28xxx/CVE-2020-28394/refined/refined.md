Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-28394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing RAS files in Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Specifically, the software reads past the end of an allocated buffer when processing a malformed RAS file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read data beyond the allocated buffer leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- Potential for code execution if chained with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious RAS file within the affected software.
- User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious RAS file.
- The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the malicious file.
