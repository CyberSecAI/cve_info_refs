  "ID": "CVE-2020-28097",
  "Summary": "The Linux kernel is susceptible to a vulnerability related to software scrollback functionality, which if successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the software scrollback code within the VGA console driver (vgacon.c) and framebuffer console driver (fbcon). There were multiple small special cases and issues that were difficult to maintain, leading to bugs such as out-of-bounds reads when resizing the console or scrolling. The software scrollback feature was also considered unused, prompting its removal rather than attempting further fixes.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds read in `vgacon_scrolldelta` due to negative offset after VT_RESIZE",
     "Multiple unspecific bugs in the software scrollback code",
	 "Lack of maintenance and active use of the software scrollback code leading to bitrot."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or a Denial of Service (DoS).  Specifically, out-of-bounds reads can leak kernel memory, and other errors in the code could cause crashes, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Local access required to interact with the console and trigger the vulnerable code.",
     "A crafted ioctl call (VT_RESIZE) to cause `soff` to have a negative value leading to an out-of-bounds read"
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to interact with the VGA console, likely via an open `/dev/ttyN`. They also need to be able to trigger the vulnerable `vgacon_scrolldelta()` code which is reachable via ioctl calls."
