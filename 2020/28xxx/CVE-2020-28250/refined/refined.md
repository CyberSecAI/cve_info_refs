Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Cellinx NVT Webserver (version 5.0.0.014b.test 2019-09-05) has a critical flaw in its authentication mechanism. The authentication process is handled on the client-side (using Javascript), which can be easily bypassed. This means that the server does not properly verify the user's identity or authorization to perform actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Access Control:** The NVT Webserver does not enforce proper access control on server-side. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the server doesn't authenticate or authorize requests to sensitive CGI scripts like `SetFileContent.cgi`.
*   **Client-Side Authentication:** Relying solely on client-side JavaScript for authentication is insecure, as attackers can manipulate HTTP requests and responses to bypass the checks.
*   **Root Privileges for Web Server:** The web server process runs with root privileges, which allows it to access any file on the system, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution as Root:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send manipulated requests to `SetFileContent.cgi` and write any content to any file on the server. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute commands as root, gaining complete control over the affected system.
*   **Reading Sensitive Files:** An attacker can exploit `GetFileContent.cgi` to read any file on the server, including sensitive configuration files and user credentials stored in `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Root Account Creation:** By writing to `/etc/passwd` (or a similar user database file), the attacker can create a new root account without a password. This allows them to maintain persistent access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who can reach the web server over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests/Responses Manipulation:** The attack involves manipulating HTTP requests and responses to bypass client-side authentication and access vulnerable CGI scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to manipulate them (e.g., using tools like `curl` or a web proxy).

**Summary**

The vulnerability in the Cellinx NVT Web Server is a severe case of improper access control and insecure authentication practices, which results in full root-level compromise of the system. The client-side authentication allows an attacker to bypass all security mechanisms to read sensitive files and write to files which allows for both information disclosure and root remote command execution.
