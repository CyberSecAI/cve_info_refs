Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a single token for agent authentication across all instances of Desktop Central agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure agent authentication mechanism.
- Lack of unique identification and authentication for individual agents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The content does not explicitly detail the impact of exploitation, but based on the description, the impact of using a single token for all agents implies a potential for unauthorized access, impersonation, and compromised control of multiple endpoints if the token is compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is centered around the agent authentication process. By compromising the single authentication token, an attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to gain access to the single authentication token used for all agents.
- The attacker needs to be able to exploit the agent-server communication to use the compromised token.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by implementing client certificate authentication, which generates unique certificates for each agent. This is achieved in Endpoint Central build 10.0.647 and later versions.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is not applicable to cloud editions of Desktop Central, Patch Manager Plus and Remote Access Plus.
- The provided information is more detailed than the CVE description placeholder.
