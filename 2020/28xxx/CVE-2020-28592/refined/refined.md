- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the "uri" field in a JSON request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-120). The server allocates 104 bytes for the response but doesn't validate the length of the "uri" field before copying it.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. By sending a specially crafted JSON object with a "uri" field exceeding the allocated buffer size, an attacker can overwrite the heap, potentially leading to control of the execution flow.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious JSON object with an oversized "uri" field to TCP port 41234.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device. The device must be in its initial setup phase when it acts as a Wi-Fi access point. The attacker can be on the same network as the device or able to reach it over the network.
