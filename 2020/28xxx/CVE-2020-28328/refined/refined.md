Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of weaknesses that, when chained together, lead to remote code execution. These weaknesses are:
1.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:  A low-privileged user can upload a file containing malicious JavaScript. This file is stored on the server, and the link to access it can be used to execute the script in the context of another user, such as an administrator.
2.  **Insecure Log File Configuration:** An administrator can modify the system settings, specifically the log file name and extension. This allows an attacker to set the log file name to an arbitrary value (e.g., `shell.php`) and set the extension to blank, thereby creating an executable PHP file on the server.
3.  **Log File Poisoning:** User-controlled input, such as the user's last name, is written to the log file when logging is set to "info." An attacker can inject malicious PHP code into this input, which is then written into the log file, completing the RCE chain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application allows arbitrary file uploads with no sanitization, leading to stored XSS.
*   **Insecure Configuration:** The application does not properly validate the log file name and extension, allowing the creation of executable PHP files.
*   **Log Injection:** User-controlled data is written directly to a log file without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to injection.
*   **Lack of CSRF protection**: The application allows modification of the log file via a simple POST request that is not protected by any CSRF token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability chain leads to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the SuiteCRM application, gaining control of the system.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The XSS can be used to hijack administrator sessions, allowing an attacker to perform actions as an administrator.
*   **Data Breach:** With RCE, an attacker can potentially access sensitive data stored in the SuiteCRM database or on the server's filesystem.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control of the server and use it for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  A low-privileged user uploads a file containing malicious JavaScript.
2.  The low-privileged user tricks an administrator into clicking a link to the malicious file.
3.  The malicious JavaScript executes in the administrator's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the administrator.
4.  The attacker, now with admin privileges, modifies the log file settings to create a PHP log file.
5.  The attacker updates a user's profile with malicious PHP code which gets written to the log.
6.  The attacker accesses the PHP log file via a web browser, executing the injected code, leading to RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker needs a low-privileged account on the SuiteCRM instance to upload the malicious file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking on the malicious file link, triggering the XSS and session hijacking.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SuiteCRM instance to carry out the attack and execute code.

**Additional Details**

*   The exploit requires administrative access, which makes the CVSS score a little lower than stated.
*   The vulnerability was patched in SuiteCRM version 7.11.17.
*   The provided exploit code uses a bash reverse shell, which is then executed on the server.
*   The exploit can be chained using JavaScript using fetch calls to modify the configuration, update user last name, and trigger code execution.
