# CVE-2020-28328 SuiteCRM Remote Code Execution via Log File System Setting and Log File Poisioning

## Overview

I recently discovered two vulnerabilities in [SuiteCRM](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM) that provides an attack chain for a low privileged user to achieve code execution on the underlying operating system. The attack chain is Cross-Site Scripting, which can be used to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery, which leads to Remote Code Execution by tampering with the application configuration and poisioning a log file. This is all achieved via a file upload that contains malicious JavaScript that a low privileged user can trick a user with administrative privileges into running. The Proof-Of-Concept files and video I have attached demonstrates a low privileged user performing this attack and obtaining areverse shell on the system that is hosting SuiteCRM.

[This was patched in version 7.11.17 of SuiteCRM.](https://suitecrm.com/suitecrm-7-11-17-7-10-28-lts-versions-released/)

## Severity

[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

I don't fully agree with this rating as the exploit does require administrative access which would change PR:L to PR:H, adjusting the final score from an 8.8 to a 7.2.

I would rate it as: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Ref: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28328>

## Version details

SuiteCRM Version 7.11.15

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

The stored Cross-Site Scripting exists in the 'Create Documents' file upload. A low privileged user is able to upload a file with any contents. The user can then examine the link provided to download this document and ascertain the file's location on the filesystem by locating the `id` parameter. This long, random value is the name of the fileinside the /uploads/ directory. The user can place arbitrary JavaScript in this file and then send the link to another user. This can be used to hijack another user's session and/or perform actions on that user's behalf, which will be shown in the PoC video.

## Remote Code Execution

After discovering that I could become the admin through session hijacking via the Cross-Site Scripting, I then discovered that I could control the system properties under 'Admin → System Settings', namely the log file property. Log file extensions were pretty well blocked, but I was able to use BurpSuite to update the 'Log File Name' value to be any arbitrary value, including .php extensions. I did this by submitting a request without changing anything and capturing the POST request that actually updates the values. I changed the filename via the `logger_file_name` parameter to `shell.php` and simply made the 'Extension' field blank. That provided a php file that I could access in browser at the webroot, but I needed some php code insidethe file to execute.

Next, I examined the output in the file and noticed that I could control input into the file via user properties if I updated a user (such as the user's first or last name), if the logging was set to info (which I believe was default...). So, I captured a request in burp and inserted some php code `<?php $id =`id`; echo $id; ?>` in the `last_name` form field. This resulted in the output of the `id` command on Linux in the context of the web server user, `www-data`. The only characters that I could tell were escaped based on the log file are single quotes, double quotes, and back slashes. You can verify this by `tail`'ing the sql log file on the backend.

## Chaining the two for Cross-Site Request Forgery (One click -> shell)

I was able to perform all this as the admin user because I was able to obtain session cookies, however to have a working chain, I needed to have this execute via JavaScript in the context of the admin user. I was able to script this using a few fetch requests to perform each of these POST requests. The first one updated the system properties, the second updated the admin user's 'Last Name' field, and the last performed a GET request on the newly created log file with malicious php code. The malicious php code would perform a curl request against my machine, pull down a bash reverse shell, and then pipe the output of that curl request directly to bash, executing the code. I then uploaded this using the same method that I discussed in the XSS section and revisited the new link as the admin user. With a web server hosting my bash file and a netcat listener running, I was able to get a reverse shell.

## Mitigation

#### Cross-Site Scripting

Ensure you have `AllowOveride All` set in Apache. nginx does not have this setting and I did not test it on nginx.

#### Remote Code Execution

Update to the latest release of SuiteCRM, or at least version 7.11.17.

This is the specific fix. Commit [1618af16eaa494c4551bac961e5ac8fc3d87ab8c](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/commit/1618af16eaa494c4551bac961e5ac8fc3d87ab8c#diff-e9704a2002d127cd455e1eb0507042080bb79d362091e770803ff69a31139d0f)

## Reporting to SuiteCRM

SuiteCRM was very responsive throughout the reporting process. They acknowledged the RCE, which was patched. The XSS was the result of a web server configuration so they did not acknowlede it as a vulnerability. They did, however, note that they would be updating the documentation in light of this.

#### Timeline

06 AUG 2020 -> Both issues reported to security@suitecrm.com

07 AUG 2020 <- SuiteCRM confirms receipt of report and raises issue with internal security team

21 AUG 2020 -> I contacted security@suitecrm.com for a follow up

25 AUG 2020 <- SuiteCRM replies regarding web server config/XSS

26 AUG 2020 -> I reply to say that the suggestion of `AllowOveride All` mitigates XSS

16 SEP 2020 -> I contacted security@suitecrm.com for a follow up

17 SEP 2020 <- SuiteCRM replies to confirm the issue as a partial issue

29 OCT 2020 Update released

03 NOV 2020 -> I contact security@suitecrm.com to ensure nothing else is needed on their end before releasing writeup

05 NOV 2020 <- SuiteCRM replies

> Now we have released a patch for this issue and it is in the pubic domain, there is no problem with you doing a blog post on the vulnerabilities from our perspective.

05 NOV 2020 -> CVE requested by me

06 NOV 2020 <- [CVE-2020-28328](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28328) issued

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
