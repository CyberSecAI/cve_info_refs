Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames during the extraction of backup ZIP files. Specifically, the `native_unzip` function in `Unzip.php` concatenates the target directory and the filename from the ZIP archive without validating or sanitizing the filename. This allows relative path traversal using filenames like `../../../../payload.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Zip Slip Directory Traversal:** The core vulnerability is a Zip Slip attack due to the lack of filename sanitization, allowing an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.
- **File Extension Bypass:** The extracted filenames are not checked against a list of dangerous file extensions, which allows for the writing of executable files (e.g., PHP) even if there is a filter for extension protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can write arbitrary files to any location accessible by the web server's user context.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By writing malicious PHP files within the webroot (or potentially other locations, including outside of it), attackers can achieve RCE.
- **Extension Filter Bypass:** The lack of sanitization against dangerous extensions allows for the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Full compromise:** An attacker could gain shell access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious ZIP File:** The primary attack vector involves creating a specially crafted ZIP archive that contains filenames with relative paths to traverse directories (e.g., `../../../../payload.php`).
- **API Endpoint Exploitation:** The vulnerable endpoint is `/api/Microweber/Utils/Backup/restore`, which is used to restore the manipulated backup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have valid administrative credentials for the Microweber instance. This is because the restore functionality is restricted to admin users.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious ZIP file. This is done via the `/plupload` endpoint and then moved into the backup directory.
- **Webroot Knowledge**: The attacker needs to identify the webroot file path using debug=true output on landing page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Microweber version 1.1.20 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was patched by skipping filenames containing '..' during the extraction process in both the `zip_open` and `gzinflate` extraction execution trees.
- The patch was applied in commit `777ee9c3e7519eb3672c79ac41066175b2001b50`.
