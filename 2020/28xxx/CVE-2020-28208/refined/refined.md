Root cause of vulnerability:
The Rocket.Chat application's password reset function returns different server responses based on whether the provided email address is registered or not.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Email address enumeration vulnerability in the password reset functionality. The server responds with "result":true if the provided email exists, and "result":false if it does not. This allows attackers to determine if an email address is registered in the Rocket.Chat instance.

Impact of exploitation:
An unauthorized user can enumerate registered email addresses on the instance of Rocket.Chat. This information can be used for further attacks (such as targeted phishing campaigns).

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending HTTP POST requests to the `/api/v1/method.callAnon/sendForgotPasswordEmail` endpoint with different email addresses in the JSON payload.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special permissions. They only need network access to the Rocket.Chat server.
