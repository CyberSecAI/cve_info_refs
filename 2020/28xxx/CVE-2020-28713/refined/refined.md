{
  "vulnerability": "The Night Owl Doorbell mishandles encryption, which allows attacker to insert or spoof notifications into the device that do not correspond to any actual occurred behavior.",
  "affected_items": "Night Owl Doorbell Series - WDB-20-V2",
  "root_cause": "The Night Owl doorbell communicates events to a third-party push notification service via plaintext HTTP GET requests. These requests include parameters like command, unique identifier, event type, and event time.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Lack of encryption on HTTP requests",
    "Lack of authentication/authorization on the notification API"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can spoof events, such as ghost doorbell notifications, leading to user annoyance, potential denial of service if the user disables the application due to repeated false notifications.",
  "attack_vector": "An attacker can use tools like curl to send spoofed HTTP GET requests to the notification service endpoint.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the structure of the HTTP request and a valid device UID. No authentication or special privileges are required."
