- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application copies data from the 'action', 'cargo', and 'panel' parameters of a request and echoes it into the application's response without proper sanitization, leading to reflected XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize HTML/Javascript tags in the request parameters before including them in the response.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a user's browser session. This can lead to:
  - Performing arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf.
  - Logging victim's keystrokes.
  - Data leakage.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via crafted requests using the 'action', 'cargo', and 'panel' parameters. The attacker can send a victim a link containing the malicious URL (via email or instant message) to trigger the vulnerability. Both POST and GET requests can be used.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with injected JavaScript payload and convince a valid application user to access it. This does not require any specific position but requires the user to have an active session with the vulnerable application.
