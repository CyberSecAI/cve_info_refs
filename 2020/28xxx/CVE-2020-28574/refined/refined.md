{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the `ErrorRemoveLogTempFile` function in `cgiLog.exe` when handling the `BinaryDataBlock` parameter. This allows for path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files on the product's management console.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/officescan/cgi/cgiLog.exe` endpoint with a malicious `BinaryDataBlock` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they only need network access to the vulnerable server.",
     "additional_info": "The file deletion operation is performed under the security context of the user account running the WFBS web server, which by default is the Local System account when using Apache."
