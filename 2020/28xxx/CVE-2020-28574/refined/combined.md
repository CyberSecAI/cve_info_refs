# Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Unauthenticated Remote File Deletion

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

#### Unauthenticated Path Traversal

Trend Micro's Worry-Free Business Security (WFBS) version 10.0, build 2228 and below are vulnerable to an unauthenticated path traversal allowing for remote file deletion. The specific flaw exists within the ErrorRemoveLogTempFile function in cgiLog.exe when handling of the BinaryDataBlock parameter provided to the /officescan/cgi/cgiLog.exe endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in a file deletion operation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to delete arbitrary files using the CURL command provided in the PoC section of this advisory. The file deletion operation runs under the security context of the user account running the WFBS web server. WFBS can install and use Apache as its web server, which runs under the Local System account by default.

### Solution

Update to Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security 10 SP1 Patch 2260.

### Proof of Concept

curl -ki -d 'event=19&uid=12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012AAAA&BinaryDataBlock=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\<path\_of\_file\_to\_be\_deleted>' 'https://<wfbs\_host>:4343/officescan/cgi/cgiLog.exe'
