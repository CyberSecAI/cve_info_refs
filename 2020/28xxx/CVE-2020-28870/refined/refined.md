```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows arbitrary PHP code execution via the `template_code` parameter in the `json_fp.php` endpoint. This occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize user input before passing it to an `exec` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
    "Code Injection",
    "Insecure Deserialization (implied, due to lack of sanitization leading to PHP code execution)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted POST request with a malicious PHP code payload to the `/modules/sys/form_personalization/json_fp.php` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They require network access to the target server."
