{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `upload` function in `index.js` of the `google-cloudstorage-commands` package uses the `exec` function from `child_process` to execute a command without proper sanitization of user input, leading to command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection (CWE-78)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server running the vulnerable code, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This includes data exfiltration, denial of service, and other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing malicious input to the `upload` function, specifically in the `path` argument, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "proof_of_concept": "The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by passing the string `\"./\",\"& touch JHU\", true` to the vulnerable `upload` function causing a file `JHU` to be created on the system.",
