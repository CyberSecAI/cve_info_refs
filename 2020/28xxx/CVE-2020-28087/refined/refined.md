- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `code` parameter in the `/jeecg-boot/sys/dict/loadtreedata` interface of jeecg-boot is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The code directly uses user-supplied input in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. They may also be able to gain access to the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the `/jeecg-boot/sys/dict/loadtreedata` endpoint with malicious SQL code within the `code` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint, typically through a network connection. No specific authentication or user role was specified as a requirement for exploitation in the provided content, implying the vulnerability could be exploited without prior access to the application.
