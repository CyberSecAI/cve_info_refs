- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect authorization check in the affected component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863). The vulnerability allows reading PLC variables without proper authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can read access-protected PLC program variables, potentially gaining insight into sensitive data or the system's operation.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access over port 102/tcp. The attacker needs to send a request to read multiple attributes at once.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device. No authentication is required.
