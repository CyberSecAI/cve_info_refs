Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28422

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Command Injection in the `exports` function of the `git-archive` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Command Injection:** The package takes a bare git repository, archives it, and exports it as a tarball to a given path. This process is vulnerable to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Confidentiality:** A successful attack can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, with all resources within the impacted component being disclosed to the attacker.
* **Availability:** Exploitation can cause performance degradation or interruptions in resource availability. While the attacker cannot completely deny service, the resources might be partially or temporarily unavailable.
* **Integrity:** The vulnerability does not cause a loss of integrity in the impacted component.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local:** The vulnerable component is not directly bound to the network stack. The attacker must have local read/write/execute capabilities on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system running the vulnerable code with at least low privileges.
* **Effort:** Successful exploitation requires an attacker to invest effort in preparation or execution due to the high attack complexity.
* **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
