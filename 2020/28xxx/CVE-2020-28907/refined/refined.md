    "related_to_cve": true,
    "description": "The provided content details a privilege escalation vulnerability in Nagios Fusion, specifically CVE-2020-28907, where an attacker can escalate privileges from the 'apache' user to 'root' by exploiting a command injection vulnerability in the `cmd_subsys.php` script and the sudoers script `change_timezone.sh`.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization within the Nagios Fusion software, specifically in the `cmd_subsys.php` script's handling of the timezone parameter and in the `getprofile.sh` script.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection: The `cmd_subsys.php` script's handling of the timezone parameter from the commands table is vulnerable to command injection due to a lack of proper input sanitization.",
        "Insecure file permissions: The script `/usr/local/nagiosxi/scripts/repair_databases.sh`  is writable by the nagios user, and therefore can be modified by a low privilege user.  ",
      "Privilege Escalation: The `change_timezone.sh` script can be executed by the `nagios` user with sudo privileges. This allows the `nagios` user to modify and execute the file with root privileges, facilitating privilege escalation."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to gain full root control of the Nagios Fusion server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, including the ability to modify configurations, access sensitive data, and potentially launch further attacks on other systems within the network.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves exploiting the command injection vulnerability in the `cmd_subsys.php` script by inserting a malicious row into the Fusion databaseâ€™s commands table, which is then executed through the `change_timezone.sh` script.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an authenticated session to Nagios Fusion, and be able to execute arbitrary PHP code in the context of the apache user. This could be achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities on the server, or through a cross site scripting attack.",
     "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is part of a chain of vulnerabilities that can lead to a complete compromise of a large Nagios deployment. This can include attacking upstream from customer sites to service provider networks. This document also details other vulnerabilities which are not related to CVE-2020-28907 including RCE on Nagios XI, XSS on Nagios Fusion, and RCE on Nagios Fusion."
