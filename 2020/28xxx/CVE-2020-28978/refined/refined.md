Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28978:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Canto WordPress plugin version 1.3.0 contains a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Blind SSRF: The plugin allows an unauthenticated attacker to make requests to arbitrary internal and external servers.
- The vulnerability exists in the `/includes/lib/tree.php` file. The `subdomain` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can force the server running the vulnerable WordPress plugin to make requests to arbitrary locations.
- This can potentially lead to information disclosure by scanning internal services and networks, or making requests to external services to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable `/includes/lib/tree.php` file with a malicious URL in the `subdomain` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `tree.php` file relative to the WordPress installation and be able to send HTTP requests to it.
- The attacker can be external to the network.

**Additional details:**
- The payload requires appending a question mark ("?") to bypass some form of input validation within the vulnerable plugin.
- This vulnerability is one of three similar vulnerabilities listed, the others being CVE-2020-28976 and CVE-2020-28977, which affect `detail.php` and `get.php` respectively.
