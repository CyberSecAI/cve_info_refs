Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way the `@scullyio/scully` package serializes transfer state using `JSON.stringify()` before writing it into the HTML page. This method does not properly sanitize the data, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization/escaping, which enables XSS attacks. The application does not adequately neutralize or encode user-provided data when embedded into the HTML, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser when they load a page using the vulnerable version of the package. This could lead to:
    - Stealing cookies/hijacking user sessions.
    - Exposing sensitive user information.
    - Accessing privileged services/functionality.
    - Delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability appears to be triggered when data is serialized and written to HTML. The attacker would likely craft a malicious URL containing the exploit, which, when visited, would inject the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code through the vulnerable application. This could involve crafting a malicious link or providing malicious input that is then processed by the application. No special privileges are required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- **Vulnerable Package:** `@scullyio/scully` versions prior to 1.0.9
- **Fix:** Upgrade to version 1.0.9 or higher where the vulnerability is resolved.
- The provided github content highlights a pull request that addresses this issue by encoding the embedded json to prevent the XSS.

- **CVSS Score:**
    - Snyk: 7.3 (High)
    - NVD: 6.1 (Medium)
- **Exploit Maturity:** A proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability is known to exist.

**In summary**, the core issue is that the `@scullyio/scully` package doesn't properly sanitize/escape data when serializing it to HTML via `JSON.stringify()`, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability which could be exploited to perform malicious actions in a user's browser.
