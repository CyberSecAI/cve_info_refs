Based on the provided content, CVE-2020-28925 relates to the commit `c0cd530e78c2a8c6d71ceb75b10c251b39fb923a`, which is described as "Restrict `filter` options in `Request` in Twig context".

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Twig templating engine in Bolt CMS not properly sanitizing or restricting the use of the `filter` function within the `Request` object when accessed from the Twig context. This could allow an attacker to use the `filter` function with dangerous options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure use of `filter` function:** The `Request` object, when passed to Twig templates, exposed its `filter` function. This function, by design, allows data sanitization but also accepts options that could be abused to execute arbitrary code if not restricted.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of the options passed to the `filter` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Twig template injection:** Attackers could inject malicious code into Twig templates (e.g., through user-controlled data that is rendered in a template), specifically targeting the `filter` function on the `Request` object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to inject into Twig templates:** An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious code into Twig templates, which could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that use user-controlled data in templates.

**Mitigation:**
The fix implemented in commit `c0cd530e78c2a8c6d71ceb75b10c251b39fb923a` addresses the vulnerability by:

- **Restricting Filter Options:** The `RestrictedFilterTrait` introduces a list of dangerous PHP functions, and the `filter` method in `ParameterBag`, `FileBag`, and `ServerBag` are overridden to remove any options that match those blacklisted functions. This ensures that the dangerous options cannot be used via the Twig template engine when accessing the `Request` object.
- **Wrapping Request Bags:**  The `offsetGet` method in `ArrayAccessSecurityProxy.php` is modified to re-initialize all request bags (e.g., `request`, `query`, `attributes`, `files`, and `server`) with the custom `ParameterBag`, `FileBag`, and `ServerBag` classes, ensuring the filtering is applied when the request object is accessed within Twig.

In summary, this commit directly addresses the vulnerability described in the CVE by restricting the usage of the `filter` function in the `Request` object, preventing an attacker from utilizing it to execute arbitrary code.
