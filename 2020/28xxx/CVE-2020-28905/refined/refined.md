Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-28905:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2020-28905, which is described as "Nagios Fusion authenticated remote code execution (from the context of low-privileges user)". This CVE is specifically mentioned and explained within the provided text from skylightcyber.com.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of the PHP `eval()` function on unsanitized input originating from user-controlled data. Specifically, the `get_paged_table()` function in `nagiosfusion/html/includes/utils/pagination.inc.php` evaluates PHP code constructed from a user-controlled base64 encoded string.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code through the `eval()` function.
*   **Unsanitized Input:**  The application doesn't sanitize user-provided data that is then used to construct and execute PHP code.
*   **Insecure Use of `eval()`:** The `eval()` function is inherently dangerous when used with user-provided input, as it allows for arbitrary code execution.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Nagios Fusion server, potentially leading to full control of the system.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The vulnerability can be combined with other exploits to gain a foothold in an organization's network, and then be used to target additional systems through the Nagios Fusion serverâ€™s access to fused XI servers.
*   **Data Breach:** Compromised servers can expose sensitive monitoring data and potentially allow further attacks on connected infrastructure.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nagios Fusion server's web interface.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs a valid user session with permissions to interact with the affected components to send the malicious request to `ajaxhelper.php`.
*   **Maliciously Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request containing a base64-encoded and serialized string with injected PHP code, which will be executed by the application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Nagios Fusion server.
*   **Valid User Session:**  The attacker must have a valid authenticated session on Nagios Fusion.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker must have some familiarity with web application attacks, PHP, and be able to craft the necessary base64 encoded malicious payload.

**Summary of extracted information:**

The vulnerability arises from the insecure usage of `eval()` within the `get_paged_table` function, where unsanitized user input can be injected and executed on the Nagios Fusion server. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `ajaxhelper.php` endpoint. This vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, can lead to complete compromise of a Nagios deployment and further lateral movement in the network.
