Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the OpenAsset Digital Asset Management application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Blind SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `currentSearchItems` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code. Because it is a blind SQLi, the attacker does not see output directly but can infer results based on application response time due to the use of the `SLEEP()` command in the injected SQL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Full Database Access: Successful exploitation could allow attackers to retrieve all information contained in the application database which could contain sensitive business data.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the `/AJAXPage/SearchResults` endpoint.
-  `currentSearchItems` Parameter: The malicious SQL code is injected via the `currentSearchItems` parameter within the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenAsset application to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application server.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Versions: The vulnerability was discovered in OpenAsset versions 12.0.19 (Cloud) and 11.2.1 (On-Premise).
- Fixed Versions: The vulnerability is fixed in OpenAsset versions 12.0.23 (Cloud) and 11.4.10 (On-Premise).
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jack Misiura from The Missing Link.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided using the `SLEEP()` function to demonstrate the time-based blind SQL injection.
