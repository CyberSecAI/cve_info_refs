Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `gin` web framework's handling of the `X-Forwarded-For` header. When `gin` is exposed directly to the internet, a client can spoof their IP by manipulating this header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113):** The vulnerability is classified as an HTTP Response Splitting issue, which arises due to improper handling of user-controlled input (specifically, the `X-Forwarded-For` header) in HTTP responses. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data into the header, potentially leading to various attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **IP Spoofing:** The primary impact is the ability to spoof a client's IP address, which can have various consequences like bypassing IP-based access controls.
- **Confidentiality:** The vulnerability has a high confidentiality impact, potentially leading to a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker.
- **Integrity:**  Modification of data is possible but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited.
- **User Interaction:**  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network.
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Low attack complexity:** The attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.
