Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28425:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `curljs` package directly passes user-provided input to the `curl` command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands through the package's interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information on the server.
*   **Integrity:** An attacker can modify data or system configurations.
*  **Availability:** An attacker may reduce performance or cause interruptions in service availability.
*   The specific impact depends on the context and privileges of the process running the `curljs` module.
*   Arbitrary code execution leading to complete system compromise is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   Attackers can inject malicious commands via the `curljs` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any special privileges.
*   The attacker only needs to be able to pass input to the vulnerable `curljs` package.
*   No user interaction is needed for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code can be exploited using the following Proof of Concept (PoC) code:
    ```javascript
    var a=require("curljs");
    a("' & touch JHU # '")
    ```
    This code injects the command `touch JHU` which, when executed, creates a new file named `JHU` in the current working directory.
*   Snyk assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.3 (High) for this vulnerability with a network attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required and no user interaction.
*   NVD assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical)

**Additional Notes:**

*   There is no fixed version available for `curljs`.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed on 11 Dec 2020 and published on 20 Jan 2021.
*   The vulnerability was found by the JHU System Security Lab.
