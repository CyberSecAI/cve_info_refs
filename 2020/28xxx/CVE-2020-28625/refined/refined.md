{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation when parsing files containing Nef polygon data. Specifically, the code reads integer values from the input file and uses them as indices into vectors without verifying if these indices are within the valid bounds of the vectors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Type confusion",
      "Improper validation of array index (CWE-129)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution due to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is providing a specially crafted, malformed input file containing Nef polygon data to the vulnerable CGAL library. This file triggers out-of-bounds reads when parsed.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted .nef or .nef3 file to an application using the vulnerable CGAL library for processing."

  "cve_2020_28625_details": {
    "vulnerability_location": "Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_facet() fh->boundary_entry_objects SLoop_of",
    "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `read_facet` function, specifically when handling `SLoop_of` objects within the `boundary_entry_objects` of a facet.  The code reads an index and uses it to access a vector of `SLoop_of` objects without bounds checking."
