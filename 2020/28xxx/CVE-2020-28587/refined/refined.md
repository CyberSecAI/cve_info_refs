The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28587.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `CEscherObject::ReadNativeProperties` method, specifically within the handling of record type 0xf150. The method reads a `uint32` length field from the record header and uses it to copy data into a statically sized buffer within the `CEscherObject`. The size of the buffer is less than the provided length, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The core weakness is that the software copies data of a user controlled size into a static sized buffer on the heap, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Lack of bounds checking:** The application fails to validate the length field against the buffer size, leading to the overflow when length > buffer size.
- **Trust of user-controlled data:** The application directly trusts a length field taken from the input file and uses it to copy data without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Heap corruption:** The buffer overflow corrupts heap metadata or other heap objects, leading to program termination.
- **Potential code execution:** Due to heap corruption, an attacker might be able to achieve code execution under the context of the application if they can carefully craft the overflow to overwrite certain memory regions containing code pointers.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious document:** An attacker can craft a malicious Microsoft Excel document with a specially crafted `MsoDrawingGroup` record to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** The attacker must entice a victim into opening the malicious document using SoftMaker PlanMaker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create a malformed excel file:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted Excel file with a specific structure that will trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to open the malicious document.
