Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `ntesseract` package. Specifically, the `image` parameter in the `lib/tesseract.js` file is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core issue is the ability to inject operating system commands through the `image` parameter. The code constructs a command by concatenating user-provided input with other parts of the command, without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable `ntesseract` package is used.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Impact:** The attacker could potentially gain full access to the system, leak sensitive data, modify files, or cause a denial of service. The CVSS score reflects this with high ratings for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is classified as network, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to be able to control the 'image' parameter passed to the ntesseract.process function.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `lib/tesseract.js`, which constructs a command by concatenating the `image` parameter along with other options.
- The fix involves adding double quotes around the image parameter to prevent command injection:
    ```javascript
    if (image.startsWith('"')) {
        image = '"' + image + '"';
    }
    ```

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:
```javascript
var a =require("ntesseract");
a.process("& touch JHU #","",function(){})
```
This PoC injects the command `touch JHU` which would create a file named "JHU" on the server.

**Affected Versions:**
- Versions of `ntesseract` prior to 0.2.9 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to `ntesseract` version 0.2.9 or higher.

**CVSS Score:**
- Both Snyk and NVD assigned a critical CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "fix: vulnerable to command injection" in the GitHub repository highlights the vulnerability being addressed by the fix.
