Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28129 (Although the exploit-db entry does not directly specify a CVE, the vulnerable software is the same and the date matches, so we can assume this exploit relates to the CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Gym Management System" when handling the "Package Name" and "Description" fields. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database.
- The application renders the unsanitized data back to users, leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
   - Cookie theft (as demonstrated in the exploit).
   - Session hijacking.
   - Defacement of the web page.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the "Packages" page of the Gym Management System.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript within the "Package Name" and "Description" fields.
- The payload is submitted to the server via an HTTP POST request.
- The server stores the malicious payload in the database.
- When a user views the packages page, the stored JavaScript is rendered in their browser, triggering the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "Packages" page of the application.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator but must be a logged-in user.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to submit forms to the web application.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit demonstrates the injection of `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` as a simple proof-of-concept, but a more sophisticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to perform more complex malicious actions.
- The exploit-db entry indicates that the vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Gym Management System.
- The `date_created` error in the SQL code, which is also contained in the provided content, is not directly related to this XSS vulnerability, but rather an issue with the default values being used in the database schema.
