Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28461:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `js-ini` library is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to its handling of the `__proto__` property during parsing of INI files. The library doesn't properly sanitize or restrict the use of `__proto__` as a section name, allowing attackers to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is that the `parse` function in `js-ini` allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects by providing a malicious INI file that includes `__proto__` as a section name.
- **Unsafe Object Property Handling:**  The parser does not prevent or sanitize the `__proto__` key, which allows for modification of the base object prototype, leading to potential exploitation of the javascript prototype chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates object attributes using `eval()`, attackers could potentially achieve remote code execution.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can manipulate properties that the application relies on for security or other informative values, such as isAdmin flags or tokens.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious INI file:** The attacker crafts a specially crafted INI file with a `__proto__` section to pollute the prototype.
- **Application parsing:** The vulnerable application parses the malicious INI file using the `js-ini` library's `parse` function, leading to the prototype pollution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to supply input to application:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious INI file to an application that uses the `js-ini` library.
- **No specific privileges required:** The vulnerability does not require any user interaction.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects `js-ini` versions prior to 1.3.0.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided which demonstrates the prototype pollution by creating a payload INI file that sets the `polluted` property on `__proto__`. The corresponding `poc.js` file then demonstrates how the polluted object can be accessed in the global scope.
- The content also explains the underlying concepts of prototype pollution in javascript, including how unsafe recursive merges and property definitions by path can lead to this kind of vulnerability
- Various methods for prevention are mentioned, including:
  - freezing the prototype `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`.
  - using schema validation for JSON input
  - avoiding unsafe recursive merges
  - using objects without prototypes like `Object.create(null)`
  - using `Map` instead of `Object`.
- CVSS scores are included from both Snyk and NVD, highlighting the high severity of the vulnerability.
