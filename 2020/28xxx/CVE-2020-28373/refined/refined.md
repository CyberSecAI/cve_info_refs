Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-28373:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `upnpd` service of Netgear routers.
*   It occurs when processing specific SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) messages.
*   The `upnpd` service copies user-provided data into a stack buffer without proper size checks.

**Vulnerability/Weaknesses:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow.  The service doesn't validate the length of the data received, allowing an attacker to overwrite stack memory.
*   **Insecure Data Handling:** User-controlled data is copied directly into a stack buffer, which is a common weakness leading to buffer overflows.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The upnpd service doesn't properly check the size of the incoming SSDP messages/data before copying it to a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Netgear router. This gives the attacker complete control over the router.
*   **Compromised Router:** RCE on the router can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Network eavesdropping and data theft
    *   Malware deployment
    *   Botnet participation
    *   Manipulation of router settings
    *   Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:**  The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted SSDP messages to the vulnerable upnpd service.
*   **LAN-based attack:** The provided information specifies that any user on the local network can trigger the vulnerability, indicating it is reachable on the LAN.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same local network (LAN) as the vulnerable Netgear router.
*   **Ability to send custom UDP packets:**  Attackers need to be able to craft and send malicious SSDP messages, which involves sending UDP packets to the router.
*   **No authentication:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (from Content):**
*   **Affected Devices:** A range of Netgear router models in the R, RAX, and XR series are confirmed to be affected, including: R6400v2, R6400, R7000P, XR300, R8000, R8300, R8500, R7300DST, R7850, R7900, RAX20, RAX80, R6250, and likely more models.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC video (pov.mkv) is provided which demonstrates the exploit
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was reported to CVE and Netgear on 2020-11-09.
*   **Acknowledgement:** The vulnerability was discovered by the "Technology Research Institute of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group" with credit to @peanuts62, @leonW7 and @cpegg.
