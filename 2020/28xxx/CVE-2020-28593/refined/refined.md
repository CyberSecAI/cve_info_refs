{
  "CVE-2020-28593": {
    "root_cause": "A hidden functionality (backdoor) in the configuration server allows enabling a debug port.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unauthenticated access to a debugging port (55555) by sending a specially crafted JSON object during device setup.",
      "The static encryption key and IV are embedded in the firmware, which is weak.",
        "Ability to trigger a manual firmware update to a client-specified remote location"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution could be achieved by providing a malicious firmware update and, with the debugging port open, an attacker can monitor the device's activities remotely. This also allows access to log data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious JSON packet to the device during setup to enable the debug port.",
      "Connecting to the open debug port (55555) over TCP.",
          "Triggering a firmware update to a malicious server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device during setup or, if the device is already set up, must factory reset it before attempting to gain access. The attacker needs the ability to send a modified configuration packet during the setup phase of the device."
