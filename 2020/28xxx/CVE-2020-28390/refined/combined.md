WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Conﬁgure a web application ﬁrewall to ﬁlter trafﬁc containing XSS Injection and SQL Injections

• Restrict access to application webserver for trusted users only

• CVE-2020-7576: Review access permissions for the application and limit the number of users with

the ability to create containers, packages, or to register defects

• CVE-2020-28390: Ensure that only trusted persons have access to Opcenter Execution Core

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Opcenter Execution Core (formerly known as Camstar Enterprise Platform) by Siemens PLM Software
is a universal usable Manufaturing Execution System (MES). This product allows manufacturers to
signiﬁcantly increase the quality of a product during manufacturing process. The process begins with
the planning, supply management, quality management, stretching to production and even to customer
service. This effectively supports the whole product life-cycle.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7576

An authenticated user with the ability to create containers, packages or register defects could perform
stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks within the vulnerable software.

The impact of this attack could result in the session cookies of legitimate users being stolen. Should
the attacker gain access to these cookies, they could then hijack the session and perform arbitrary
actions in the name of the victim.

CWE-79:
Generation (‘Cross-site Scripting’)

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7577

Through the use of several vulnerable ﬁelds of the application, an authenticated user could perform an
SQL Injection attack by passing a modiﬁed SQL query downstream to the back-end server.

The exploit of this vulnerability could be used to read, and potentially modify application data to which
the user has access to.

# Advisory Details

January 14th, 2021
## Siemens JT2Go JT File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-051ZDI-CAN-11972

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-26984](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-26984) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [JT2Go](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JT files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write before the start of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Siemens has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-09-30 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2021-01-14 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
