{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the web interface when handling the 'wrlPwd' parameter in a POST request to '/goform/WifiBasicSet'.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The router crashes and enters a boot loop, requiring a physical factory reset to restore functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request with an overly long string for the 'wrlPwd' parameter to the '/goform/WifiBasicSet' endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface and must have successfully obtained a valid session token, which requires either knowing or brute-forcing the admin password"
