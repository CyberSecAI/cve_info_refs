```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    -  Authorization Bypass: The application allows access to the installation panel even after the installation process is complete, enabling an attacker to create a new user.
    -  Remote Code Execution: The `upload.php` script performs insufficient file type validation, relying only on the `getimagesize()` function. This can be bypassed by prepending image properties to an executable file, allowing arbitrary PHP code execution.
    -  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Stored XSS vulnerabilities exist in the service configuration tab, allowing a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads.
    -  Session Cookie Security: Session cookies lack the `HttpOnly` flag, making them vulnerable to theft.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Insecure installation process: Installation files are not removed after the installation.
    - Insufficient input validation: Lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding.
    - Weak file upload validation: Usage of `getimagesize()` for file type validation which is easily bypassed.
    - Missing authentication checks: No authentication checks in the `upload.php` script.
    - Missing `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Unauthorized user creation.
    - Arbitrary code execution leading to full system compromise.
    - JavaScript injection leading to malicious actions on user browsers.
    - Session cookie theft.
- Attack vectors:
    -  Accessing the installation panel after installation to create a new user.
    -  Uploading a malicious file with a prepended image header to the `upload.php` script.
    -  Injecting XSS payloads in the service configuration tab.
    -  Stealing session cookies via JavaScript.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Network access to the vulnerable Monitorr instance.
    - Ability to craft specific HTTP requests.
