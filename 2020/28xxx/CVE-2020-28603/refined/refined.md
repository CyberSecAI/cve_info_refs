Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper index validation when parsing Nef polygon data in the CGAL library. Specifically, the `read_hedge` function reads integer values from the input file and uses them directly as indices into the `Halfedge_of` vector, without checking if they are within the valid range.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. When a crafted input file provides an index that exceeds the size of the `Halfedge_of` vector, accessing `Halfedge_of[epr]` (where `epr` is the malicious index) results in reading memory outside the allocated buffer.
- **Type confusion:** As a consequence of the out-of-bounds read, the read operation will not return an object of the expected type and corrupt the program state. This type of memory corruption can be leveraged to gain arbitrary code execution.
- **Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129):**  The code fails to validate the provided indices before using them to access array elements, which is a direct cause of the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by causing type confusion and memory corruption. This is due to the lack of bounds checking and the subsequent ability to read arbitrary memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted `.nef`, `.nef2` or `.nef3` file containing malicious index values in the halfedge data section. This can be achieved by directly opening the file or by opening the file through a program or service that utilizes the CGAL library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed `.nef` file as input to an application using the vulnerable CGAL library.

**Specific Details for CVE-2020-28603:**

- **Function:** `Nef_2/PM_io_parser.h PM_io_parser::read_hedge()`
- **Vulnerable Code:** `e->set_prev(Halfedge_of[epr]);` where `epr` is read directly from the input file without range checks, which can lead to an out of bounds read.
- **File Format**: The vulnerability occurs while parsing nef files of version 2

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information highlights a common vulnerability pattern across multiple CVEs in the CGAL library. Specifically related to parsing the nef format.
- The vulnerability exists in CGAL versions prior to 5.4.1.
- Multiple sources confirm the issue and its impact.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
