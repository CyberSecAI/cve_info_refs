  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The `merge()` function in the 'controlled-merge' npm module does not validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property. Specifically, it doesn't check if the property being assigned is an own property of the object or if it's trying to modify the object's prototype.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution: The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the `prototype` of an object by injecting a malicious value through the `attr` argument of the `merge()` function. This is due to the absence of validation before assigning the property.",
      "Improper Input Validation: The `merge()` function does not properly validate user-supplied input before using it, which leads to the prototype pollution vulnerability. Specifically, it doesn't validate if the supplied attribute is an object's own property."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) by polluting the object's prototype. It may also lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the polluted prototype properties are used later in the code. The proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can set a `status` property on the `prototype` object, which may be used to validate the status of an object. This can alter the behavior of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The `merge()` function takes arguments `obj1`, `obj2`, and `attr`. By manipulating the `attr` value to include `prototype`, an attacker can inject malicious values from `obj2` directly into the prototype of `obj1`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `merge()` function, specifically the `obj2` and `attr` arguments. No special privileges are required."
