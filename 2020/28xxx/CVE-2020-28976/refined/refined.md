Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The Canto WordPress plugin versions 1.3.0 contains a blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. This occurs because the plugin's `detail.php`, `get.php`, and `tree.php` files improperly handle user-supplied input in the `subdomain` parameter, allowing an attacker to control the server's outgoing requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SSRF:** The plugin allows an attacker to cause the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external servers. The response from the request is not returned to the attacker.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
*   **Input Validation:** The plugin lacks proper validation of the `subdomain` parameter. Specifically it lacks proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker could potentially use the vulnerable server to scan internal networks, identify other systems and services, and potentially discover more vulnerabilities.
*   **Access to Internal Resources:** The attacker could potentially access internal resources that are not intended to be public such as databases or other internal servers.
*   **Denial of Service:**  An attacker might be able to use the vulnerable server to make requests that cause it to become overloaded or to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL targeting the vulnerable endpoints (`detail.php`, `get.php`, or `tree.php`) of the Canto WordPress plugin.
*   The `subdomain` parameter in the URL is set to an attacker-controlled address. The payload must end with a "?" character to bypass an apparent filtering mechanism.
*   The WordPress server, upon processing the request, makes an HTTP request to the attacker-specified server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site or have any special privileges.
*   The attacker only needs network access to the WordPress server running the vulnerable plugin.

**Technical Details:**
The attacker crafts a request to one of the following endpoints, replacing `<wordpress_server>` with the actual address of the Wordpress website and `<attacker_ip:port>` with the IP address and port of the attacker's listening server:
-  `<wordpress_server>/wp-content/plugins/canto/includes/lib/detail.php?subdomain=<attacker_ip:port>?`
-  `<wordpress_server>/wp-content/plugins/canto/includes/lib/get.php?subdomain=<attacker_ip:port>?`
-  `<wordpress_server>/wp-content/plugins/canto/includes/lib/tree.php?subdomain=<attacker_ip:port>?`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Canto WordPress Plugin version 1.3.0.
- The provided resources indicate that the issue was addressed in later plugin versions, though specific versions where the fix was implemented were not included in the provided text.
- The gist mentions CVE-2020-28976, CVE-2020-28977 and CVE-2020-28978, where each CVE appears to be referring to the same SSRF vulnerability present on different files within the plugin.

The vulnerability described here is more detailed than a simple placeholder, as it includes details on how the vulnerability can be exploited.
