# Vulnerabilities discovered in AudimexEE ver 14.1.0

### Overview

AudimexEE (<https://www.web-audimex.com/audimexee>) is an audit software solution for large enterprises that fulfils highest demands in terms of the implementation of auditing processes and corporate structures surrounding a powerful and highly flexible audit universe.

### Discovered by

#### [Gianluca Palma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piuppi/) ([@piuppi](https://twitter.com/piuppi)) of [Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A.](https://www.eng.it)

### Proof of concept (POC)

#### SQL Injection vulnerability in "Documents component" found in AudimexEE version 14.1.0 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the object\_path parameter.

* Go to **[CVE-2020-28115](/piuppi/Proof-of-Concepts/blob/main/AudimexEE/SQLInjection.md)**

#### AudimexEE before 14.1.1 is vulnerable to Reflected XSS (Cross-Site-Scripting). If the recommended security configuration parameter "unique\_error\_numbers" is not set, remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via 'action, cargo, panel' parameters that can lead to data leakage.

* Go to **[CVE-2020-28047](/piuppi/Proof-of-Concepts/blob/main/AudimexEE/Reflected-XSS.md)**

### Timeline

* **2020-10-09**: Discovered and reported to [Audimex](https://www.web-audimex.com)
* **2020-10-09**: Got instant response from Audimex development team, "Thanks for your analysis report. We will evaluate your finding and get back to you soon with our feedback."
* **2020-10-12**: Audimex fixed this issue in audimexEE version 14.1.1
* **2020-11-05**: I have obtained the CVE IDs and published the PoC
