## Description

Stockdio Historical Chart contains a plugin and a widget that provide the means to display a live chart with intraday and historical prices and information for stock, index, currencies or commodities. Over 65 different stock exchanges and a large number of market indices, currencies and commodities are supported.

If you’re using the standard Gutenberg editor, the easiest way to include this plugin on your page is using the Historical Chart block, which is included in the Stockdio Financial Visualizations category.

If you’re using a different editor o prefer to use the shortcode, below is a sample to help you start. Please be aware that most of the parameters listed below are optional, and are also available through the plugin’s settings page. Any parameter you include in the shortcode will overwrite the parameter used in the settings page.

```
[stockdio-historical-chart symbol="AAPL" stockExchange="NYSENasdaq" width="580" height="380" motif="financial" palette="financial-light"]

```

This plugin is part of the Stockdio Financial Widgets, which also includes the following plugins:

* [Stock Quotes List](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-quotes-list/).
* [Stock Market Overview](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-market-overview/).
* [Stock Market News](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-market-news/).
* [Stock Market Ticker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-market-ticker/).
* [Economic & Market News](https://wordpress.org/plugins/economic-market-news/).

The following parameters are supported in the shortcode and also available through the plugin’s settings page:

**stockExchange**: The exchange market the symbol is a member of (optional). If not specified, NYSE/NASDAQ will be used by default. For a list of available exchanges please visit www.stockdio.com/exchanges.

**symbol**: The company’s stock symbol (ex. **AAPL**), market index ticker (ex. **^SPX**), currency pair (ex. **EUR/USD**) or commodity ticker (ex. **GC**). For a list of available market indices please visit www.stockdio.com/indices. For available currencies please visit www.stockdio.com/currencies and for available commodities, please go to www.stockdio.com/commodities.

**compare**: Specify a list of valid stock symbols or market indices against which to compare the base symbol, separated by semicolon (ex. **MSFT;GOOG;^SPX;^IXIC**). Not case sensitive (optional).

**height**: Height of the chart in either px or % (default: 320px).

**width**: Width of the chart in either px or % ( default: 100%).

**displayPrices**: Allows to specify how to display the prices on the chart, using one of the following options (default: Line):

* Line
* Candlestick
* Area
* OHLC
* HLC

**includeVolume**: Allows to display or hide the volume on the chart. By default, volume is visible. Use includeVolume=false to hide it (optional).

**performance**: If enabled (true), price performance (percent change) will be displayed, instead of actual price.

**culture**: Allows to specify a combination of language and country settings, used to display texts and to format numbers and dates (e.g. Spanish-Spain). For a list of available culture combinations please visit http://www.stockdio.com/cultures.

**intraday**: If enabled (true), intraday delayed data will be used if available for the exchange and number of days is between 1 and 5. For a list of exchanges with intraday data available, please visit www.stockdio.com/exchanges.

**days**: Allows to specify the number of days for the period to display. Used only if the start and/or the end date are not specified. If not specified, its default value is 365 days. If intraday data is available for the stock exchange and the exchange is currently open, the default number of days is 1.

**allowPeriodChange**: If enabled (true), it provides a UI to allow the end user to select the period for the data to be displayed. This UI is only available if the from and to parameters have not been specified. This UI is enabled by default.

**from**: From date. If not specified, the “from” date will be the “to” date minus the number of days specified in the **days** parameter.

**to**: To date. If not specified, the “to” date will be today’s date.

**motif**: Design used to display the visualization with specific aesthetics, including borders and styles, among other elements. (optional). For a list of available motifs please visit www.stockdio.com/motifs.

**palette**: Includes a set of consistent colors used for the visualization. (optional). For a list of available palettes please visit www.stockdio.com/palettes.

**font**: Allows to specify the font that will be used to render the chart. Multiple fonts may be specified separated by comma, e.g. Lato,Helvetica,Arial.

**loadDataWhenVisible**: Allows to fetch the data and display the visualization only when it becomes visible on the page, in order to avoid using calls (requests) when they are not needed. This is particularly useful when the visualization is not visible on the page by default, but it becomes visible as result of a user interaction (e.g. clicking on an element, etc.). It is also useful when using the same visualization multiple times on a page for different devices (e.g. using one instance of the plugin for mobile and another one for desktop). We recommend not using this by default but only on scenarios as those described above, as it may provide the end user with a small delay to display the visualization (optional).

Great software that does exactly what it says on the tin.
Even better is the customer support who have always accommodated our needs in a very timorous manner.
Highly recommended

After having been a user for a month, the quota for the chart becomes lesser. Available calls for the free version is too limited at 500 requests and will drop further after the first month. It’s also not possible to sustain in the long run as the purchase option for monthly/yearly pricing is unreasonable.

## Description

Stockdio Historical Chart contains a plugin and a widget that provide the means to display a live chart with intraday and historical prices and information for stock, index, currencies or commodities. Over 65 different stock exchanges and a large number of market indices, currencies and commodities are supported.

If you’re using the standard Gutenberg editor, the easiest way to include this plugin on your page is using the Historical Chart block, which is included in the Stockdio Financial Visualizations category.

If you’re using a different editor o prefer to use the shortcode, below is a sample to help you start. Please be aware that most of the parameters listed below are optional, and are also available through the plugin’s settings page. Any parameter you include in the shortcode will overwrite the parameter used in the settings page.

```
[stockdio-historical-chart symbol="AAPL" stockExchange="NYSENasdaq" width="580" height="380" motif="financial" palette="financial-light"]

```

This plugin is part of the Stockdio Financial Widgets, which also includes the following plugins:

* [Stock Quotes List](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-quotes-list/).
* [Stock Market Overview](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-market-overview/).
* [Stock Market News](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-market-news/).
* [Stock Market Ticker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stock-market-ticker/).
* [Economic & Market News](https://wordpress.org/plugins/economic-market-news/).

The following parameters are supported in the shortcode and also available through the plugin’s settings page:

**stockExchange**: The exchange market the symbol is a member of (optional). If not specified, NYSE/NASDAQ will be used by default. For a list of available exchanges please visit www.stockdio.com/exchanges.

**symbol**: The company’s stock symbol (ex. **AAPL**), market index ticker (ex. **^SPX**), currency pair (ex. **EUR/USD**) or commodity ticker (ex. **GC**). For a list of available market indices please visit www.stockdio.com/indices. For available currencies please visit www.stockdio.com/currencies and for available commodities, please go to www.stockdio.com/commodities.

**compare**: Specify a list of valid stock symbols or market indices against which to compare the base symbol, separated by semicolon (ex. **MSFT;GOOG;^SPX;^IXIC**). Not case sensitive (optional).

**height**: Height of the chart in either px or % (default: 320px).

**width**: Width of the chart in either px or % ( default: 100%).

**displayPrices**: Allows to specify how to display the prices on the chart, using one of the following options (default: Line):

* Line
* Candlestick
* Area
* OHLC
* HLC

**includeVolume**: Allows to display or hide the volume on the chart. By default, volume is visible. Use includeVolume=false to hide it (optional).

**performance**: If enabled (true), price performance (percent change) will be displayed, instead of actual price.

**culture**: Allows to specify a combination of language and country settings, used to display texts and to format numbers and dates (e.g. Spanish-Spain). For a list of available culture combinations please visit http://www.stockdio.com/cultures.

**intraday**: If enabled (true), intraday delayed data will be used if available for the exchange and number of days is between 1 and 5. For a list of exchanges with intraday data available, please visit www.stockdio.com/exchanges.

**days**: Allows to specify the number of days for the period to display. Used only if the start and/or the end date are not specified. If not specified, its default value is 365 days. If intraday data is available for the stock exchange and the exchange is currently open, the default number of days is 1.

**allowPeriodChange**: If enabled (true), it provides a UI to allow the end user to select the period for the data to be displayed. This UI is only available if the from and to parameters have not been specified. This UI is enabled by default.

**from**: From date. If not specified, the “from” date will be the “to” date minus the number of days specified in the **days** parameter.

**to**: To date. If not specified, the “to” date will be today’s date.

**motif**: Design used to display the visualization with specific aesthetics, including borders and styles, among other elements. (optional). For a list of available motifs please visit www.stockdio.com/motifs.

**palette**: Includes a set of consistent colors used for the visualization. (optional). For a list of available palettes please visit www.stockdio.com/palettes.

**font**: Allows to specify the font that will be used to render the chart. Multiple fonts may be specified separated by comma, e.g. Lato,Helvetica,Arial.

**loadDataWhenVisible**: Allows to fetch the data and display the visualization only when it becomes visible on the page, in order to avoid using calls (requests) when they are not needed. This is particularly useful when the visualization is not visible on the page by default, but it becomes visible as result of a user interaction (e.g. clicking on an element, etc.). It is also useful when using the same visualization multiple times on a page for different devices (e.g. using one instance of the plugin for mobile and another one for desktop). We recommend not using this by default but only on scenarios as those described above, as it may provide the end user with a small delay to display the visualization (optional).

Great software that does exactly what it says on the tin.
Even better is the customer support who have always accommodated our needs in a very timorous manner.
Highly recommended

### [Free version is limited](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/free-version-is-limited/)

After having been a user for a month, the quota for the chart becomes lesser. Available calls for the free version is too limited at 500 requests and will drop further after the first month. It’s also not possible to sustain in the long run as the purchase option for monthly/yearly pricing is unreasonable.

with 500 call / day for all plugins this ‘free’ version is useless and just a trap

# CVE-2020-28707 – XSS in Stockdio Historical Chart plugin for WordPress before version 2.8.1

Jan 16, 2021 | [Research](https://jondow.eu/category/research/)

This is a short explanation  of an postMessage() based XSS that I have found in the Stockdio Historical Chart WordPress plugin that can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stockdio-historical-chart/). The plugin has over 1.000 active installs and a quick Google search reveals a multitude of vulnerable websites.

The official CVE-2020-28707 notification can be found [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28707).

Please note that after I have found the vulnerability and reported it, the fixed was implemented in the version 2.8.1.

The content below is mostly word for word how I reported it with little editing for context and some parts (such as the steps to reproduce) removed.

Enjoy.

### ****Description:****

The *eventListener* function that handles the *postMessage* on lines 8-10 of the JavaScript file **stockdio\_chart\_historical-wp.js** found in the default installation folder **/wp-content/plugins/stockdio-historical-chart/assets/** does not check the origin from where the message is coming. This leaves any application that has the plugin installed vulnerable to a DOM based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
The *postMessage* method enables cross-origin communication. Normally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages they originate from share the same protocol, port number, and host (also known as the “same-origin policy”). *postMessage* provides a controlled mechanism to securely circumvent this restriction (if used properly). This however means that if not properly used, it can allow one website (in our case an attacker controlled website) to interact with the vulnerable website, bypassing same-origin policy.

### ****The vulnerability:****

As can be seen in the image below, the **stockdio\_eventer** function (line 8) listens for any *postMessage* event. After a message event is sent to the application, this function sets the “e” variable as the event and checks that both types of the **data** and **data.method** are not undefined (empty) before proceeding to **eval** the **data.method** received from the *postMessage*.

![](https://jondow.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/javascript.png "javascript")

As can be seen, there is no validation that the information received does not come from malicious websites.

### ****Exploitation:****

In order to provide a Proof of Concept for this vulnerability, I have installed the latest version of the plugin on my own wordpress instance.
On another domain, i have uploaded a web page with the following contents:

```
<script>
        var popup = window.open('https://VULNERABLE.PAGE/');
        var msg = {};
        msg.method = "alert(document.domain)";
        function post(){popup.postMessage(msg,'*')}
        setInterval(post,1000);
</script>
```

This script opens the vulnerable wordpress instance that has the plugin installed and sends a *postMessage* to it with the **data.method** set as a JavaScript code that opens an alert box with the contents of *document.domain* from the DOM. Once a victim browses the attacker controlled website, he is redirected to the vulnerable website where the malicious JavaScript code is executed. This can be seen below:

![](https://jondow.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/postmsg-xss.png "postmsg-xss")
### ****Why this is important:****

The impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can vary from one web application to another. It ranges from session hijacking to credential theft and other security vulnerabilities. By exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and take over their account. This is done by accessing the *document.cookie* from the DOM. It only takes a legitimate user or admin that is logged in the wordpress instance to click on a attacker controlled link. Furthermore, having control of the DOM, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in much more ways but I find that the above example is the most relevant.

### ****Recommended fix:****

As per the documentation fond here: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage> the Security concerns section states as follows:

> **If you do not expect to receive messages from other sites, *do not* add any event listeners for `message` events.** This is a completely foolproof way to avoid security problems.
>
> If you do expect to receive messages from other sites, **always verify the sender’s identity** using the `origin` and possibly `source` properties. Any window (including, for example, `<http://evil.example.com>`) can send a message to any other window, and you have no guarantees that an unknown sender will not send malicious messages. Having verified identity, however, you still should **always verify the syntax of the received message**. Otherwise, a security hole in the site you trusted to send only trusted messages could then open a cross-site scripting hole in your site.

### ****Timeline of events:****

The timeline of the events were as follow:
Oct. 19 2020 – Me sending the vulnerability to the developers of the plugin
Ian. 4 2021 – Me sending a follow-up mail as I had no reply and the vulnerable version was still available on the WordPress Plugin store
Ian. 14 2021 – Me sending the report to the WordPress Plugin VulnOps team
Ian. 15 2021 – WordPress reply and new version of the plugin with the fix implemented available on the store.

Jim was looking all over the web to find plugins that allow him to present some basic charts, on his best day it would take him at least an hour to test, debug and get the libraries running before bringing the new data in.

Most of his financial front-end ended up as plain text content with a lot of jibber-jabber talk trying to explain financial data and trends without any visual aids for the readers.

## Take Donald's case. He works for a Stock Trading Company

#### **Before** Stockdio he was asked to revamp the User Experience at the company's front-end, but he was having trouble adding true value on top of the services they already offer to their clients.

In our rapidly changing world running out of added value at the highest level of the game is an expensive mistake no company can afford. Donald knew it is critical to draw value from external technology experts.

He discovered **Stockdio** and immediately fell in love with it, and so did his stock trading clients when they noticed how fast and sharp the data was being presented and delivered to them.

## Check out Bill. He's a Project Manager for a Software Development Company

#### **Before** Stockdio Bill had to hire third-party developers to expand his team in order to meet the tight deadlines their financial customers require on web and app development.

Keeping up with the frenetic pace of production nowadays is no easy task. From small agencies to large development firms the need of delivering better, faster, more competitive and optimized apps and data seems to be the common factor.

Bill had decided that the best option was to team up with third-party development agencies and even hired a financial advisor to help him define the scope and understand the lingo of their top financial clients. But all this was costly and time consuming.

## **Now** he and his team rely on the flexibility, power and non-technical approach of Stockdio to deliver charts and graphs inside their financial apps in minutes and ***without having to pay for third-party development.***

## There's Mark. Senior Web Developer for a Financial News Site

#### Before Stockdio Mark and his team were dealing with 2 mayor issues when presenting graphical data: recurrent high spikes on server loads and low customization options to match their branding.

When you run your apps on a poorly optimized code or server it can increase your operational costs and impact your business even with a small audience. That impact can grow exponentially up to an unsustainable point when you are publishing for a larger audience.

Arbitrary templates and little customization options to match your brand could significantly damage your corporate image and confuse your audience, not to mention that they look amateurish and unprofessional. Also, paying extra to enable these features often raises concerns and discontent.

## **Now** Mark has significantly reduced the server load rendering graphical data directly from the Stockdio CDN and gained full customization control with motifs, palettes and advanced options *at no extra cost.*

## Have you met Jeff? He's a Data Analyst for a fortune 500 company
