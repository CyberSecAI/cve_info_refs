Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28707:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of origin validation in the `postMessage` event listener within the `stockdio_chart_historical-wp.js` file. Specifically, the `stockdio_eventer` function doesn't check the origin of incoming `postMessage` events before processing them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS. The vulnerable code uses `eval` to execute the `data.method` received from the `postMessage`, without verifying its source or sanitizing the input. This allows arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected and executed in the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code fails to validate the origin of `postMessage` events. It assumes that all messages are from trusted sources, which is incorrect.
- **Use of eval():** The use of `eval()` on unsanitized user-controlled input (in this case, data from the `postMessage`) is a dangerous practice that directly leads to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Session hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies to impersonate logged-in users.
- **Account takeover:** By impersonating a legitimate user, attackers can take over accounts, including admin accounts on the WordPress site.
- **Data theft:** Attackers can access and steal sensitive data from the website.
- **Website defacement:** Attackers can modify the content or appearance of the website.
- **Malware distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware through the vulnerable site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through `postMessage()` communication.
- The attacker hosts a malicious webpage on an attacker controlled domain.
- The malicious page opens a new window to the vulnerable website using `window.open()`
- The attacker page sends a `postMessage` to the vulnerable website with malicious JavaScript code in the `data.method` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to host a webpage:** The attacker needs to host a webpage with malicious JavaScript.
- **User interaction:** The victim needs to be tricked into visiting the attacker controlled webpage.
- **Vulnerable plugin installation:** The targeted WordPress site must have the vulnerable version of the Stockdio Historical Chart plugin installed.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content also includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the vulnerability, demonstrating how an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript using a simple script. The content also mentions the timeline of the vulnerability report and the fix, stating that the vulnerability was patched in version 2.8.1.
