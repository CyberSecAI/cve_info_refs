Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-28450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `extend` function of the `decal` npm package. This function is susceptible to prototype pollution due to unsafe handling of object merging.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The `extend` function allows an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This is achieved by providing a crafted object with a `__proto__` property, which, when merged by the vulnerable function, modifies the prototype of all JavaScript objects.
- **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The `extend` function performs a recursive merge without proper sanitization or validation of input. This allows properties, including `__proto__`, to be modified in the prototype chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By polluting methods like `toString` or `valueOf` on `Object.prototype`, the attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions and disrupt application functionality.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates attributes from objects (e.g., using `eval`), a polluted `Object.prototype` can be used to inject malicious code.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary properties into objects, potentially leading to privilege escalation (e.g. setting `isAdmin` to true), or manipulation of security-related properties like cookies and tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a malicious crafted object to the `extend` function in the `decal` library.
- Attackers can craft the JSON or object that will be merged in the `extend` function, by including a `__proto__` property with the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the input to the vulnerable `extend` function. This could be achieved through various means, depending on how the `decal` package is used.
- No specific privileges are needed, as the vulnerability can be exploited without special access to the vulnerable system.
- The vulnerability is considered remotely exploitable as it can be triggered over a network by manipulating the input to the `extend` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Snyk report includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is tracked as `SNYK-JS-DECAL-1051028` by Snyk.
- The Snyk report also notes that the vulnerability was discovered and reported by Nikita Stupin.
- There is no fixed version for `decal` at the time of this report.
- The vulnerability is present due to how `extend` function merges properties of the source object into target.
- The Snyk report provides additional background on prototype pollution, and ways to prevent it.
