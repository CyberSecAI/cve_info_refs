# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Subject: CVE-2020-28928: musl libc: wcsnrtombs destination buffer overflow

The wcsnrtombs function in all musl libc versions up through 1.2.1 has
been found to have multiple bugs in handling of destination buffer
size when limiting the input character count, which can lead to
infinite loop with no forward progress (no overflow) or writing past
the end of the destination buffera.

This function is not used internally in musl and is not widely used,
but does appear in some applications. The non-input-limiting form
wcsrtombs is not affected.

All users of musl 1.2.1 and prior versions should apply the attached
patch, which replaces the overly complex and erroneous implementation.
The upcoming 1.2.2 release will adopt this new implementation.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-0cf36f9134
2021-06-08 01:06:15.794782
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : musl
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 1.2.2
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <https://musl.libc.org>
Summary : Fully featured lightweight standard C library for Linux
Description :
musl is a C standard library to power a new generation
of Linux-based devices. It is lightweight, fast, simple,
free, and strives to be correct in the sense of standards
conformance and safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

#### What's new for 1.2.2 The release adds the `\_Fork` function from the
upcoming edition of POSIX and takes advantage of the interpretation dropping the
async-signal-safety requirement from `fork` to provide a consistent execution
environment (not restricted to calling only async-signal-safe functions) after a
multithreaded parent forks. This solves deadlocks which would otherwise be
effectively unfixable in some language runtimes that expose `fork` as part of
their contract with applications, as well as various library and application
software that could and should be fixed, but hasn't been. A number of related
issues in synchronization between `fork`, `abort`, async IO, `posix\_spawn`,
`pthread\_exit`, and other components have been fixed as part of this change.
The `realpath` function has been rewritten to do its own path traversal, rather
than depending on procfs magic symlink contents for `O\_PATH` file descriptors.
This makes it work prior to mount of `/proc` and in container or chroot
environments where `/proc` contents may not accurately reflect the pathname as
visible to the calling process. The C versions of the square root functions,
used on archs without a native FPU instruction for square root, have also been
rewritten with significant improvements to performance, especially on archs that
lack FPU entirely. This rewrite also fixes the lack of accurate `sqrtl` on archs
with quad-precision `long double`. New functions added include the
aforementioned `\_Fork`, `reallocarray` from OpenBSD, `gettid` along with
`SIGEV\_THREAD\_ID` timer notification support, and `tcgetwinsize`/`tcsetwinsize`
from POSIX-future. A buffer overflow (CVE-2020-28928) in `wcsnrtombs` has been
fixed with the function essentially rewritten. This function is not widely used
and the bug is not relevant to software that does not use it directly (it's not
used by other libc components), but it may be serious for software that does. An
assortment of lesser bugs have also been fixed.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 34 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchain](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchain "Changes/GNUToolchain")
* [F34Boost175](/wiki/Changes/F34Boost175 "Changes/F34Boost175")
* [F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.16](/wiki/Changes/golang1.16 "Changes/golang1.16")
* [Remove\_make\_from\_BuildRoot](/wiki/Changes/Remove_make_from_BuildRoot "Changes/Remove make from BuildRoot")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, Januar 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

### Remove make from BuildRoot

*koji block-group-pkg f34-rebuild build make*

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f34
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f34. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f34 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f34
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-20 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [‚ÄúCritical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins‚Äù](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Subject: CVE-2020-28928: musl libc: wcsnrtombs destination buffer overflow

The wcsnrtombs function in all musl libc versions up through 1.2.1 has
been found to have multiple bugs in handling of destination buffer
size when limiting the input character count, which can lead to
infinite loop with no forward progress (no overflow) or writing past
the end of the destination buffera.

This function is not used internally in musl and is not widely used,
but does appear in some applications. The non-input-limiting form
wcsrtombs is not affected.

All users of musl 1.2.1 and prior versions should apply the attached
patch, which replaces the overly complex and erroneous implementation.
The upcoming 1.2.2 release will adopt this new implementation.

# [musl libc](.) Release History

## Security Advisories

**Please take notice of the following advisories if you intend to use
versions other than the latest release.**

All versions prior to 1.2.2 are affected by
[CVE-2020-28928](https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/11/19/1), a
buffer overflow in the input-length-limited `wcsnrtombs` function,
potentially affecting any program which uses this function.

On 32-bit x86 ("i386") only, all versions prior to 1.1.23 are affected
by
[CVE-2019-14697](https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2019/08/06/13).
Other archs are not affected.

Versions 0.9.15 through 1.0.4 and 1.1.0 through 1.1.7 are affected by
[CVE-2015-1817](https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2015/03/30/1) and
should not be used without patching.

All versions prior to 1.1.16 are affected by
[CVE-2016-8859](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/10/19/1)
and should not be used without patching.

Versions 1.1.2 through 1.1.16 are affected by
[CVE-2017-15650](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/10/20/1)

## Stable 1.2 series

[musl-1.2.5.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.2.5.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.2.5.tar.gz.asc))
- February 29, 2024

This release adds extension functions `statx` and
`preadv2`/`pwritev2`, with fallback implementations for older kernels,
and adds two new ports: `loongarch64` and `riscv32`. Minor changes to
the `printf` family of functions have been made for conformance to new
standards interpretations/requirements. TLSDESC support for riscv64
has also been added.

Bugs fixed include some DNS issues related to new TCP fallback
functionality, several rare race conditions, potentially incorrect
return value when `glob` aborts, and several signifiant arch-specific
bugs affecting TLSDESC on arm, riscv64 icache flushing, and sh
`sigsetjmp` and `dlsym` `RTLD_NEXT`.

[musl-1.2.4.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.2.4.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.2.4.tar.gz.asc))
- May 1, 2023

This release adds TCP fallback to the DNS stub resolver, fixing the
longstanding inability to query large DNS records and incompatibility
with recursive nameservers that don't give partial results in
truncated UDP responses. It also makes a number of other bug fixes and
improvements in DNS and related functionality, including making both
the modern and legacy API results differentiate between `NODATA` and
`NxDomain` conditions so that the caller can handle them differently.

On the API level, the legacy "LFS64" ("large file support")
interfaces, which were provided by macros remapping them to their
standard names (`#define stat64 stat` and similar) have been
deprecated and are no longer provided under the `_GNU_SOURCE` feature
profile, only under explicit `_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE`. The latter will
also be removed in a future version. Builds broken by this change can
be fixed short-term by adding `-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE` to `CFLAGS`, but
should be fixed to use the standard interfaces.

The dynamic linker (and static-PIE entry point code) adds support for
the new compact "RELR" format for relative relocations which recent
linkers can generate. Use of this linker feature for dynamic-linked
programs will make them depend on having musl 1.2.4 or later available
at runtime. Static-linked PIE binaries using it, as always, are
self-contained and have no such dependency.

A large number of bugs have been fixed, including many in the wide
`printf` family of functions, incorrect ordering of digits vs
non-digits in `strverscmp`, and several rare race-condition corner
cases in thread synchronization logic at thread exit time, in
multi-threaded `fork`, `pthread_detach`, and POSIX semaphores.

[musl-1.2.3.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.2.3.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.2.3.tar.gz.asc))
- April 7, 2022

This release adds the `qsort_r` function (POSIX future) and several
minor extension interfaces, and support for the alternative SPE FPU
present on some PowerPC CPU models.

Notable bugs fixed include an old regression in `wcwidth` of Hangul
combining vowels and finals, a 1.2.2 regression breaking `duplocale`
when `malloc` is replaced, null-dereference crash of aligned
allocation functions on underlying `malloc` failure, out-of-bounds
timezone data read when handling distant-past timestamps, longstanding
incorrect `dl_iterate_phdr` reporting of module TLS pointers, and
several math library bugs that resulted in wrong results for some
inputs, including incorrectly-rounded fmaf on all softfloat archs.

Many non-bugfix compatibility improvements have also been made,
including having `free` preserve `errno` (POSIX future requirement),
better `TZ` environment variable handling, and having `gettext` accept
null message pointer (returned unchanged).

[musl-1.2.2.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.2.2.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.2.2.tar.gz.asc))
- January 15, 2021

The release adds the `_Fork` function from the upcoming edition of
POSIX and takes advantage of the interpretation dropping the
async-signal-safety requirement from `fork` to provide a consistent
execution environment (not restricted to calling only
async-signal-safe functions) after a multithreaded parent forks. This
solves deadlocks which would otherwise be effectively unfixable in
some language runtimes that expose `fork` as part of their contract
with applications, as well as various library and application software
that could and should be fixed, but hasn't been. A number of related
issues in synchronization between `fork`, `abort`, async IO,
`posix_spawn`, `pthread_exit`, and other components have been fixed as
part of this change.

The `realpath` function has been rewritten to do its own path
traversal, rather than depending on procfs magic symlink contents for
`O_PATH` file descriptors. This makes it work prior to mount of
`/proc` and in container or chroot environments where `/proc` contents
may not accurately reflect the pathname as visible to the calling
process.

The C versions of the square root functions, used on archs without
a native FPU instruction for square root, have also been rewritten
with significant improvements to performance, especially on archs that
lack FPU entirely. This rewrite also fixes the lack of accurate
`sqrtl` on archs with quad-precision `long double`.

New functions added include the aforementioned `_Fork`, `reallocarray`
from OpenBSD, `gettid` along with `SIGEV_THREAD_ID` timer notification
support, and `tcgetwinsize`/`tcsetwinsize` from POSIX-future.

A buffer overflow
([CVE-2020-28928](https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/11/19/1))
in `wcsnrtombs` has been fixed with the function essentially
rewritten. This function is not widely used and the bug is not
relevant to software that does not use it directly (it's not used by
other libc components), but it may be serious for software that does.
An assortment of lesser bugs have also been fixed.

[musl-1.2.1.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.2.1.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.2.1.tar.gz.asc))
- August 4, 2020

This release features the new "mallocng" malloc implementation,
replacing musl's original dlmalloc-like allocator that suffered from
fundamental design problems. Its major user-facing new properties are
the ability to return freed memory on a much finer granularity and
avoidance of many catastrophic fragmentation patterns. In addition it
provides strong hardening against memory usage errors by the caller,
including detection of overflows, double-free, and use-after-free, and
does not admit corruption of allocator state via these errors.

Other enhancements in this release include changes to the `res_*` API
to report DNSSEC status of the results (needed for correct
implementation of DANE in applications) and new arch-specific
optimized string and math functions, especially `memcpy` and `memset`
for AAarch64.

A major logic/synchronization error in lock skipping after a
multi-threaded process returns to single-threaded state has been
fixed, along with a number of lesser bugs, including some
time64-related regressions on 32-bit archs. One of these was actually
a kernel vdso bug that broke `clock_gettime` on arm on hardware where
the vdso should not be used; as a result, arm vdso support has been
disabled until there is a reliable and inexpensive way to detect
whether it's safe to use. Bugs and recent regressions affecting all
mips archs and other arch-specific bugs have also been fixed.

[musl-1.2.0.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.2.0.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.2.0.tar.gz.asc))
- February 20, 2020

This release moves all 32-bit archs to 64-bit `time_t`, enabling them
to represent times beyond January of 2038.

There are no new requirements on kernel version, and this is not a
hard ABI break, but the type changes do impact compatibility between
code built against previous versions of musl and code built against
musl 1.2. Users upgrading 32-bit systems should read the [detailed
time64 release notes](time64.html). 64-bit systems are not affected.

In addition, character data has been updated to align with Unicode
12.1.0, along with fixes for some errors in the data and a replacement
for inefficient and unmaintainable case-mapping code. Correctness of
results has been improved in the math library, particularly some
complex functions and 32-bit x86 asm. Various arch-specific bugs have
also been fixed.

## End-of-life 1.1 series

[musl-1.1.24.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.24.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.24.tar.gz.asc))
- October 13, 2019

This version adds the `GLOB_TILDE` extension for `glob`, a non-stub
implementation of the `catgets` localization API, and `posix_spawn`
extensions for `chdir` in the child. Many arch-specific bugs are
fixed, some serious, including CVE-2019-14697 affecting several math
functions only on i386, broken riscv64 atomics, broken `lseek` with
large offsets on x32 and mipsn32, and broken `setjmp`/`longjmp` on
mipsr6. Various low-severity, non-arch-specific bugs are also fixed.

In addition, this release cycle sets the internal groundwork for
moving 32-bit archs to 64-bit `time_t,` needed for their future
viability as Y2038 approaches. Most of the changes are not externally
visible, but some affect which syscalls are used. Notably, mips64
`stat`-family functions can now report 64-bit file timestamps
correctly, and some time-related breakage on x32 is fixed. In
addition, `select` no longer stores remaining time back to the timeout
argument. Previously, whether it did so was arch-dependent and merely
a consequence of the Linux syscall behavior, which was found to be
mildly non-conforming.

[musl-1.1.23.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.23.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.23.tar.gz.asc))
- July 16, 2019

This version merges the RISC-V (64-bit) port and new math library
implementations of `log`, `exp`, and `pow`. Internals of how
(non-cancellable) syscalls are performed have been overhauled so that
all code necessary to make the syscall resides in the arch-provided
header and is inlinable. In the process, bugs in the implementation of
mips and microblaze syscall mechanisms were found and fixed. Several
other bugs were fixed as well, including a potentially serious one in
the layout of static TLS for shared libraries on archs that use "TLS
variant I" layout.

A couple behaviors that were clearly undesirable but arguably
mandated by POSIX have been fixed as a result of POSIX intepretations
rendering them unnecessary.

[musl-1.1.22.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.22.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.22.tar.gz.asc))
- April 9, 2019

This release makes major internal changes to the way threads, dynamic
thread-local storage, and multi-threaded `set*id()` work. There is now
a global thread list that is complete and consistent whenever the lock
protecting it can be obtained, including at the moment of kernel-level
task exit, and the lock protocol is async-signal-safe. This allows
`set*id()` to safely synchronize privilege change for all live threads
without a `/proc` dependency which turned out to have fundamental race
conditions. Availability of the thread list has also allowed `dlopen`
to install new TLS for each thread at library load time, rather than
deferring installation to first access, which improves global-dynamic
model performance and eliminates working but theoretically-unsafe
calls from the TLSDESC asm into C code when the TLSDESC model is used
to access dynamic TLS.

Major changes have also been made to the dynamic linker's library
dependency handling, for the purposes of correcting `dlsym`
dependency-order resolution of symbols and providing dependency-order
execution of shared library constructors. Calls to `dlopen` from
multiple threads can now run ctors concurrently, serializing only on
shared dependencies, and recursive calls to `dlopen` behave more
correctly (believed to be to the maximum extent possible) with regard
to non-deadlock and to ensuring that dependencies have been
constructed.

Support for the priority inheritance mutex type has also been added,
with the ability to create PI mutexes conditional on a probe for
support by the kernel.

Notable regressions in `sscanf` and `pthread_key_create` introduced in
1.1.21 have also been fixed, along with various other bugs and minor
conformance issues.

[musl-1.1.21.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.21.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.21.tar.gz.asc))
- January 21, 2019

This release makes improvements with respect to default thread stack
size, including increasing the default from 80k to 128k, increasing
the default guard size from 4k to 8k, and allowing the default to be
increased via ELF headers so that programs that need larger stacks can
be build without source-level changes, using just `LDFLAGS`.
Insufficient stack size for AIO threads on kernels that don't honor
the constant `MINSIGSTKSZ` is also fixed.

The `glob` core has been rewritten to fix inability to see past
searchable-but-unreadable path components, and to avoid excessive
stack usage and unnecessary syscalls. The `tsearch` AVL tree
implementation has also been rewritten for better size and
performance. The math library adds more native single-instruction
implementations for arm, s390x, powerpc, and x86\_64.

Various bugs are fixed, including several possible deadlocks, one of
which was a new regression in 1.1.20.

[musl-1.1.20.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.20.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.20.tar.gz.asc))
- September 4, 2018

This release introduces the ability to replace/interpose the allocator
(`malloc`) subject to certain restrictions, adds an experimental m68k
port, and makes notable improvements to stdio (application-provided
buffers), `getaddrinfo` (`AI_ADDRCONFIG`, support for IPv4-only kernel
configurations), the dynamic linker (safety against `dlopen` of
libraries using initial-exec TLS model, reclaiming unused memory on
FDPIC archs, better `dladdr` results), and handling of default thread
stack size (`pthread_setattr_default_np` now works more reliably).

Many bugs have been fixed, including potentially dangerous regressions
in `iconv` (only for new conversions to legacy encodings) and visibly
incorrect behavior in `printf` on non-x86 archs (`%a` format with
precision specifier), in `getopt_long_only` when short options are a
prefix for a long option, in complex arc-trig/hyperbolic functions, in
`strftime` and `mktime` (timezone-specific issues), and numerous
less-obvious places.

[musl-1.1.19.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.19.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.19.tar.gz.asc))
- February 22, 2018

This release features major new `iconv` functionality including
support for stateful encodings (so far, ISO-2022-JP and UTF-16/32 with
BOM-determined endianness), conversion *to* JIS-based Japanese
encodings (previously only *from* direction was supported), EBCDIC
codesets (so far IBM1047), and DOS Cyrillic (CP866). Character data
has been updated for alignment with Unicode 10.0. The `fopencookie`
stdio extension function and `strftime` padding extensions have been
added, and many smaller compatibility improvements and bug fixes have
been made.

[musl-1.1.18.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.18.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.18.tar.gz.asc))
- October 31, 2017

This release corrects regressions in `glob()` and armv4t build failure
introduced in the previous release, and includes an important bug fix
for `posix_spawnp` in the presence of a large `PATH` environment
variable.

[musl-1.1.17.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.17.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.17.tar.gz.asc))
- October 19, 2017

This release fixes numerous bugs affecting visible behavior and
safety/internal consistency, including a stack-based buffer overflow
in dns parsing and multiple sources of invalid memory accesses that
may lead to crashes. See the release notes in WHATSNEW for details.

Many new features have also been added, including deferred symbol
binding in the dynamic linker (`RTLD_LAZY` emulation), an option to
overrid `argv[0]` when running ldso to execute a program, support for
starting new sessions via `posix_spawn` (`POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID`,
accepted for standardization), and ability to query the active
thread-local locale (via `_NL_LOCALE_NAME` extension). Improvements in
compatibility with applications, build tools, and platforms have also
been made.

[musl-1.1.16.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.16.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.16.tar.gz.asc))
- December 31, 2016

This release fixes a serious under-allocation bug in `regexec` due to
integer overflow (CVE-2016-8859) and related issues.
Implementation-defined regex anchoring behavior in BRE subexpressions
has also been changed to match other implementations. A bug causing
all static-pie binaries with initialized TLS to crash at startup has
been fixed. Overflow handling in `printf` has been overhauled to
correctly handle obscure corner cases. Additional noteworthy bugs have
been fixed in `swprintf`, `strtod`, `getopt_long_only`, and time
conversion and zone handling. A major MIPS-specific regression in
1.1.15 that prevented `tcsetattr` from working at all has also been
fixed.

A new port to s390x (64-bit S/390), header-level support for Linux
4.7, 4.8, and 4.9 features, and a facility to increase default thread
stack size via `pthread_setattr_default_np` have also been added in
this release, along with other minor features and compatibility
improvements.

[musl-1.1.15.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.15.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.15.tar.gz.asc))
- July 5, 2016

This release adds new 64-bit MIPS and PowerPC ports, soft-float ABI
support for the 32-bit PowerPC arch, and support for revision 6 of the
MIPS ISA (not backwards compatible with original MIPS). Serious bugs
in `memmem`, `ungetwc`, and `putenv` have been fixed, as well as bug
that could break thread-local storage on PowerPC depending on the
compiler used to build musl, and a number of low-impact bugs in
various interfaces. The `pthread_tryjoin_np`, `pthread_timedjoin_np`,
and `sched_getcpu` extension functions, and header-level support for
new Linux 4.5 and 4.6 features, have also been added, and the
configure script now honors standard options for cross-compiling more
correctly.

[musl-1.1.14.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.14.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.14.tar.gz.asc))
- Feb 22, 2016

This release primarily fixes regressions that slipped into 1.1.13,
including a significant stdio regression causing `fputs` and `puts` to
fail on zero-length strings, ARM hard-float build failure on clang due
to a compiler bug which is now detected and worked around, a hang at
the entry point of the dynamic linker on SH/FDPIC, and `make
clean`/`make distclean` no longer working in unconfigured trees. A
minor longstanding bug in crypt-sha256/512 was also fixed, and further
improvements to the build system have been made.

[musl-1.1.13.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.13.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.13.tar.gz.asc))
- Feb 15, 2016

This release adds support for out-of-tree builds, search domains in
`resolv.conf`, VDSO-accelerated `clock_gettime` on MIPS, and building
SMP-safe/ready SH binaries for the open-hardware J2. Performance of
atomics and synchronization primitives has been greatly improved on
most "ll/sc model" RISC archs. Regex BRE now supports the widely-used
extensions `\|`, `\+`, and `\?` and larger regular expressions are now
supported. A number of minor application and toolchain compatibility
improvements have also been made, including changes which reduce the
risk of assembler and linker bugs leading to malfunctioning binaries.

Two potentially dangerous bugs have been fixed: a single-byte heap
overflow in `getdelim` and a pointer indexing error in dynamic TLS
allocation. Other bugs fixed include various issues in parsing and
error handling for `resolv.conf` and related files, incorrect error
return values for some functions, and failures to accept null pointer
arguments in some functions for which they have defined behavior. Some
arch-specific bugs affecting ARM, MIPS, and SH/FDPIC have also been
fixed.

[musl-1.1.12.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.12.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.12.tar.gz.asc))
- Oct 19, 2015

This release features arch-independent support for FDPIC, an ABI
variant that allows text segment sharing without MMU by relaxing the
usual ELF requirement that data reside at a fixed displacement
relative to code, and arch-specific support for FDPIC on SH2. CFI
(call frame information) generation support has also been added for
x86\_64 asm, improving debugging backtraces, especially when a program
is stopped during a syscall.

Several toolchain and application compatibility improvements have
been made, most notably in regards to the new byte-based C locale,
where nl\_langinfo(CODESET) now returns "ASCII" rather than
"UTF-8-CODE-UNITS"; the latter broke many applications which assumed
the returned string would be a meaningful, well-known character
encoding name.

Bugs fixed include deadlock at exit when stdin or stdout was
closed, a missing memory barrier in pthread\_join, and minor corner
case bugs in various interfaces.

[musl-1.1.11.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.11.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.11.tar.gz.asc))
- Aug 30, 2015

This release introduces a new C locale aligned with future POSIX
requirements, allowing it to be used for applying regex and other
character-based operations to data which is not necessarily valid
UTF-8. The C locale is only used when explicitly requested via
environment variables or the application; default behavior is still
governed by the C.UTF-8 locale, which operates on whole multibyte
characters.

Support for musl's first NOMMU target, SH-2, is also added in this
release, along with groundwork for future NOMMU targets. A new
musl-clang compiler wrapper is provided to reuse a non-musl-targeted
host clang for building programs against musl, as was already possible
with gcc. Major performance enhancements have been made to the dynamic
linker. On ARM systems that support it, the vdso is now used to
accelerate clock\_gettime. And debugger backtraces on i386 are improved
by a newly-added script to auto-generate call frame information for
asm source files.

The uselocale regression that slipped into the 1.1.10 release, as
well as many non-critical bugs, have been fixed. Most of these only
affected rarely-used interfaces or unusual usage cases. One
significant x86[\_64] bug that could lead to soft-deadlock in
libc-internal locking, and multiple MIPS-, PowerPC-, ARM-, and
AArch64-specific bugs, were also fixed.

[musl-1.1.10.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.10.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.10.tar.gz.asc))
- June 4, 2015

This release fixes regressions introduced as part of the dynamic
linker bootstrap overhaul in musl 1.1.9, and adds several new features
and improvements. Internal cleanup and optimizations have been made to
the locale system. A fail-safe/allocation-free `locale_t` object for the
C locale is now available via `newlocale()`, and the `iconv_open` function
now supports `""` and `"CHAR"` as aliases for the native (UTF-8) encoding.
A new crt start file, `rcrt1.o`, is provided for producing static-linked
position independent executables (PIE). Minor PIE-related
arch-specific bugs, and a bug in the `ungetc` and `ungetwc` stdio
functions which caused them to fail on files in EOF status, have also
been fixed.

A new regression in `uselocale` made it into this release. To avoid
breaking programs that call `uselocale`, all users of musl 1.1.10 should
apply the following patch:

[musl-1.1.9.tar.gz](releases/musl-1.1.9.tar.gz)
([sig](releases/musl-1.1.9.tar.gz.asc))
- May 12, 2015

This release features significant overhauls in dynamic linking that
now make it possible to build libc.so itself with stack protector
hardening. Runtime dynamic linker error messages (dlerror) are now
thread-local, and long path and symbol names in messages are no longer
truncated. The sigsetjmp/siglongjmp functions have been redesigned to
restore signal mask after restoring the context, rather than before,
to prevent the possibility of unbounded stack growth when using
siglongjmp to return from a signal handler while under heavy signal
load. Global code size and performance improvements have been made for
toolchains supporting protected visibility.

Various bugs have been fixed, including issues when detached
threads exit with robust mutexes held, static TLS alignment errors,
wrongful continuation of several path search operations after
transient failures, two memory leaks, a crash on OOM, and significant
malfunction of the duplocale function. Many arch-specific fixes were
also made, including broken stack protector on powerpc and x32 and
several issues on mips, sh, aarch64, and x32.

operations on ARM targets, improving efficiency when built for recent
(v7+) cpu models and ensuring (via runtime detection) that baseline
ARM binaries, which traditionally depended on the kernel's
kuser\_helper page for atomic support, work even on newer cpu/kernel
combinations where it might be disabled for hardening purposes.
Extensions to the getopt, getopt\_long, and fnmatch functions have been
added for greater compatibility with applications, and various
low-impact bugs have been fixed.

trigger but persist in other implementations such as glibc/NPTL. A
number of other bugs have also been fixed, including bugs in stdio,
clock, iconv, siglongjmp, and various header files.

## Alpha series

[musl-0.7.12.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.12.tar.gz)
- July 3, 2011
New improvements to the dynamic linker (TEXTREL and RPATH support)
increase compatibility with applications, particularly those which
don't follow best practices for building and installing libraries.
A bug in dlopen which affected only certain compiler versions (misuse
of local variables with longjmp) has been fixed. Support has been
added for the stdio\_ext.h family of interfaces, to reduce the effort
needed to compile buggy gnulib programs that try to poke at stdio FILE
internals, the random() function has been made thread-safe, mprotect
now works around a bug in the Linux syscall, and uninitialized long
double values are now handled safely in printf.

[musl-0.7.11.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.11.tar.gz)
- June 28, 2011
Shared libraries and dynamic loading (dlopen/dlsym) are now supported
through an integrated dynamic linker with near-zero overhead. Other
new features include POSIX message queues, posix\_spawn, the search.h
interfaces, the random() PRNG, and floating point environment
manipulation. Moderately severe bugs in several string and wide string
interfaces and glob(), as well as various minor bugs, have been fixed.

[musl-0.7.10.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.10.tar.gz)
- May 17, 2011
Support for numeric IPv6 address parsing has been added. Compiling
musl with PCC should now succeed and result in a working library. The
heap sort implementation of qsort has been replaced by smooth sort,
yielding nearly-linear run time on arrays which are already
mostly-sorted. Various bugs including printf floating point rounding
and scanf EOF handling have been fixed, as well as minor prototype
issues in the public headers and an issue where variadic functions
were incorrectly inlined on i386 with recent gcc versions.

[musl-0.7.9.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.9.tar.gz)
- April 23, 2011
This release features the second wave of major changes to pthread
cancellation, believed to resolve all possible issues with resource
leaks, premature cancellation, and late/missed cancellation
opportunities, all while simplifying and reducing the code size and
eliminating the cost in applications which do not use cancellation.
Several major x86\_64-specific bugs related to select(), fcntl locking,
and alignment-related crashes, and many minor bugs affecting all
platforms, have also been fixed.

[musl-0.7.8.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.8.tar.gz)
- April 13, 2011
Multiple bugs in IPv6 support, x86\_64 socket and setjmp handling, byte
swapping functions, and floating point printf formatting have been
fixed, and a workaround has been included for a bug in Linux readv()
with tty devices which caused stdio to block after reading a blank
line from the terminal. Significant additions have been made to some
header files for better compatibility with legacy applications.

[musl-0.7.7.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.7.tar.gz)
- April 6, 2011
More bugs have been fixed, including printf floating point formatting
and rounding, printf positional argument specifiers, a misaligned read
bug in strchr which could lead to crashes, general failure of
getmntent\_r, broken statvfs on x86\_64, and various minor issues. More
nonstandard and system-level interfaces have also been added,
increasing application compatibility.

[musl-0.7.6.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.6.tar.gz)
- April 4, 2011
Major bugs have been fixed, including a rare but serious bug in malloc
for large allocations of particular sizes, failure of strchr when
searching for high bytes, parsing errors in strtold, and numerous
smaller issues.

[musl-0.7.5.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.5.tar.gz)
- April 2, 2011
Support for POSIX timers (signal- and thread-based delivery) has been
added. The stdio buffering implementation now uses readv/writev
scatter-gather IO to operate on caller-provided and internal FILE
buffers together in a single syscall, improving performance. Thread
cancellation has been greatly improved to guarantee no resource leaks
when a cancellation request is received at a resource-allocating
syscall (such as open()), giving musl a major robustness advantage
over other libraries, including glibc. The syscall() interface is now
available to applications, and various other small improvements have
been made and bugs fixed.

[musl-0.7.1.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.1.tar.gz)
- March 18, 2011
The previously-missing wide character printf-family functions, and
manual stdio locking functions (flockfile) have been implemented.
Robust mutexes are also now supported. Various bugs have been fixed,
including unconditional, potentially-dangerous stack corruption by the
times() function and several minor bugs.

[musl-0.7.0.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.7.0.tar.gz)
- March 11, 2011
This release fills in a number of previously-missing interfaces,
including POSIX shared memory, semaphores, and all remaining basic
pthread and POSIX clock functions. In addition, many corrections have
been made in the semantics of signals, threads, and various other
interfaces. Significant bugs in the printf %n specifier and
pthread\_once function have been fixed. As of 0.7.0, musl is believed
to pass all tests in the Open POSIX Test Suite except those that rely
on not-yet-implemented features or that invoke undefined behavior.

[musl-0.6.0.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.6.0.tar.gz) -
February 17, 2011
This is the first release of musl to support building native x86\_64
applications, and it features a source/build framework for additional
ports. Some public header errors introduced in the previous release
have been fixed, as well as a major bug in the %n specifier for printf
and several minor bugs.

[musl-0.5.9.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.5.9.tar.gz) -
February 14, 2011
This release fixes a major bug in the intended long-term ABI for
sigset\_t/sigaction. Anyone using musl to build libraries should
upgrade immediately (and rebuild any libraries which might use
signals) to avoid running into ABI breakage issues at a later time.
The public header files have also undergone review and correction for
conformance to ISO C and POSIX requirements for what they are allowed
to make visible. Various other minor bugs have been fixed, and
internal improvements have been made to facilitate upcoming ports to
x86\_64 and possibly ARM.

[musl-0.5.0.tar.gz](releases/musl-0.5.0.tar.gz) -
February 11, 2011
Initial public release.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [‚ÄúCritical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins‚Äù](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-4892dbbf76
2021-06-08 01:05:58.761448
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : musl
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 1.2.2
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <https://musl.libc.org>
Summary : Fully featured lightweight standard C library for Linux
Description :
musl is a C standard library to power a new generation
of Linux-based devices. It is lightweight, fast, simple,
free, and strives to be correct in the sense of standards
conformance and safety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

#### What's new for 1.2.2 The release adds the `\_Fork` function from the
upcoming edition of POSIX and takes advantage of the interpretation dropping the
async-signal-safety requirement from `fork` to provide a consistent execution
environment (not restricted to calling only async-signal-safe functions) after a
multithreaded parent forks. This solves deadlocks which would otherwise be
effectively unfixable in some language runtimes that expose `fork` as part of
their contract with applications, as well as various library and application
software that could and should be fixed, but hasn't been. A number of related
issues in synchronization between `fork`, `abort`, async IO, `posix\_spawn`,
`pthread\_exit`, and other components have been fixed as part of this change.
The `realpath` function has been rewritten to do its own path traversal, rather
than depending on procfs magic symlink contents for `O\_PATH` file descriptors.
This makes it work prior to mount of `/proc` and in container or chroot
environments where `/proc` contents may not accurately reflect the pathname as
visible to the calling process. The C versions of the square root functions,
used on archs without a native FPU instruction for square root, have also been
rewritten with significant improvements to performance, especially on archs that
lack FPU entirely. This rewrite also fixes the lack of accurate `sqrtl` on archs
with quad-precision `long double`. New functions added include the
aforementioned `\_Fork`, `reallocarray` from OpenBSD, `gettid` along with
`SIGEV\_THREAD\_ID` timer notification support, and `tcgetwinsize`/`tcsetwinsize`
from POSIX-future. A buffer overflow (CVE-2020-28928) in `wcsnrtombs` has been
fixed with the function essentially rewritten. This function is not widely used
and the bug is not relevant to software that does not use it directly (it's not
used by other libc components), but it may be serious for software that does. An
assortment of lesser bugs have also been fixed.
