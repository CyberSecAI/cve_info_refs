Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SugarCRM v6.5.18 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to
compromise browser to web-application requests from the application-side.
The persistent cross site web vulnerability is located in the First Name and Last Name input fields of the
Create Employee module. Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script code as firstname and lastname
to manipulate the EditView&module=Call (Scheduling Section) module. Remote attackers with low privileged sugarcrm
accounts are able to inject own malicious script code as employee. Higher privileged application user accounts will
execute the script code on preview of the Call information to e.g gain moderator or administrator rights via session
hijacking, phishing or further persistent manipulative web attacks. The request method to inject is POST and the attack
is limited to registered user accounts.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Employee
Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] First name
[+] Last name
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] first\_name
[+] last\_name
Affected Module(s):
[+] EditView&module=Call (Scheduling)
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the sugarcrm application
2. Login as low privileged user account or register as user
3. Inject payload inside of the first\_name and last\_name parameter (add(admin/manager)/edit(admin/manager/user)/register(user/manager))
4. Save the create or submit on register
5. Move to the calls, click the user and the code executes in the scheduling section next to the user account information
Note: The script code executes immediatly each time on preview for users, managers and administrators
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched following the next steps ...
1. Restrict the input fields and disallow special chars for the first\_name and last\_name values
2. Escape and encode the contents which are transmitted from the inputs
3. Parse and sanitize the vulnerable scheduling section ouput location to ensure its filtered securely
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent cross site web vulnerability in the sugarcrm web-application is estimated as medium.
