Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28423

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the `monorepo-build` npm package. The `build` function in the package is vulnerable as it doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-78): The package allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system by manipulating input to the `build` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Total loss of confidentiality as the attacker can potentially access any data accessible to the vulnerable application.
- **Integrity:** Total loss of integrity as the attacker can modify any files accessible to the vulnerable application.
- **Availability:** Total loss of availability as the attacker can execute commands that could deny access to resources on the system.
- An attacker can gain complete control of the system on which the vulnerable package is installed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- Input to the `build` function of the `monorepo-build` package is used to execute commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special access or privileges are required. The attacker can inject commands through function parameters in the `build` function.
- No user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
- The `build` function in `monorepo-build` takes user-supplied strings as arguments that are not sanitized and passes them to an operating system shell for execution.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how arbitrary commands, such as `touch 1111` and `touch shaaaa`, can be injected and executed by the underlying shell.

**CVSS Score:**
-  Snyk and NVD both rated the vulnerability as **9.8 (Critical)**

**Mitigation:**
- There is no fixed version for `monorepo-build`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was disclosed on 11 Dec 2020
- The vulnerability was discovered by JHU System Security Lab.
