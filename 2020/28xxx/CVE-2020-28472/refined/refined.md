Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28472:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the parsing of INI files using `loadSharedConfigFiles` function in the affected packages. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the ability to inject properties into the prototypes of JavaScript objects by controlling the profile name within the INI file. If a profile name is set to `__proto__` or `profile __proto__`, it can lead to prototype pollution,

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The core weakness is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, leading to unexpected behavior.
- Unsafe parsing of INI files: The `loadSharedConfigFiles` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate profile names from the INI files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values (like integers), it can cause JavaScript exceptions and lead to denial of service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): In scenarios where the codebase evaluates attributes of an object (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can potentially achieve remote code execution by polluting specific attributes.
- Property Injection: Attackers can inject properties that the codebase relies on for security-related information (e.g. admin privileges), potentially allowing them to gain unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious INI File: The primary attack vector involves submitting a crafted INI file with a malicious profile name to an application that uses `loadSharedConfigFiles`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide/inject a malicious INI file: The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with a specially crafted INI file, which the application parses via `loadSharedConfigFiles`.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple packages, including `aws-sdk`, `@aws-sdk/shared-ini-file-loader`, `org.webjars.npm:aws-sdk`, and `org.webjars.bower:aws-sdk`.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how setting a profile name to `__proto__` in a toml file can pollute the object prototype.
- The fix involves sanitizing the profile name to prevent the pollution of object prototypes. The fix includes a blocklist for `__proto__`
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and can be exploited without user interaction.
