Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of SQL injection and arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities in the "Simple College Website" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the admin login functionality. The provided exploit uses the following payload `admin' or 1=1#` in the `username` field, which allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
2.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows an authenticated admin user to upload arbitrary files, including PHP files, without proper validation. This is achieved through the "save\_settings" action in the admin section of the alumni module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:

1.  **Gain Unauthorized Access:** The SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the admin login and gain access to the admin panel.
2.  **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE):** After gaining admin access, the attacker can upload a malicious PHP file (e.g., a reverse shell) via the file upload functionality. The attacker can then execute this file by directly accessing the file in the uploads directory, leading to remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker sends a specially crafted login request to the admin login page.
2.  **File Upload:** The attacker, after authenticating via SQL injection, uploads a malicious PHP file through the `save_settings` functionality.
3.  **Code Execution:** The attacker accesses the uploaded PHP file through a direct URL request, triggering the code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
2.  **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters**: The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameters for SQL injection (username) and file upload (form fields, particularly 'img').
3.  **Ability to craft malicious PHP code:**  The attacker requires the ability to create a functional reverse shell or other malicious code in PHP
4.  **Basic understanding of HTTP and web applications.**

**More Details than CVE:**

The provided content gives significantly more detail than a typical CVE description:

*   It provides the exact vulnerable parameters and API endpoints.
*   It provides a working exploit script in Python, showing how to combine SQL injection and file upload to achieve RCE.
*   It includes the source code of the vulnerable application, which helps in understanding the vulnerability context.
*   It specifies the product version (1.0) and provides links to download the vulnerable code.
*   It specifies the target environment for exploitation (Ubuntu 18.04 + XAMPP 7.4.11)

**Summary:**
The content describes a critical vulnerability affecting the "Simple College Website" which can be exploited using a combination of SQL Injection and unrestricted file upload leading to RCE.
