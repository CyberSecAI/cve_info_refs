Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue within the `set` function of the `decal` npm package. This function allows modification of object properties based on a provided path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is that the `set` function doesn't properly sanitize the input path, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects using the `__proto__` attribute. This means that by controlling the "path" parameter, an attacker can modify properties on the base object prototype.
- **Unsafe Property Definition:**  Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the function's ability to define properties by a user-controlled path. By setting the path to something like `__proto__.polluted`, the attacker can inject the `polluted` property onto the prototype of all JavaScript objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By polluting core object prototype methods (e.g., `toString`), an attacker can trigger JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific situations where the application evaluates a polluted object property via methods like eval(), an attacker might gain remote code execution capabilities.
- **Property Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary properties, potentially overwriting or manipulating application logic, including security checks (e.g., admin status).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves supplying a crafted object with a malicious path that uses the `__proto__` attribute to the vulnerable `set` function. This is typically done client-side by controlling the input to the vulnerable function in the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the input, specifically the `path` argument, supplied to the vulnerable `set` function. This might involve injecting malicious data via an HTTP request, manipulating user input, or other means, depending on how the `decal` library is used in the application.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `decal` package, since there is no fixed version.
- Snyk provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability, and also assigns a severity of "High".
- The Snyk advisory also includes a detailed description of prototype pollution vulnerabilities, its different types of attacks and mitigation techniques, such as freezing prototypes or using `Map` instead of `Object`.
- The Snyk advisory also includes a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.6 (High) with the following breakdown: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H
