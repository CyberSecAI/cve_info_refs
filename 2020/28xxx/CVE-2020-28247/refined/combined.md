[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-vc2p-r46x-m3vx/dependabot)

## Package

cargo

lettre
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.9.0, < 0.9.5
>= 0.8.0, < 0.8.4
>= 0.7.0, < 0.7.1

## Patched versions

0.9.5
0.8.4
0.7.1

## Description

### Impact

Affected versions of lettre allowed argument injection to the sendmail command. It was possible, using forged to addresses, to pass arbitrary arguments to the sendmail executable.

Depending on the implementation (original sendmail, postfix, exim, etc.) it could be possible in some cases to write email data into abritrary files (using sendmail's logging features).

*NOTE*: This vulnerability only affects the sendmail transport. Others, including smtp, are not affected.

### Fix

The flaw is corrected by modifying the executed command to stop parsing arguments before passing the destination addresses.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Features

Lettre provides the following features:

* Multiple transport methods
* Unicode support (for email content and addresses)
* Secure delivery with SMTP using encryption and authentication
* Easy email builders
* Async support

Lettre does not provide (for now):

* Email parsing

## Supported Rust Versions

Lettre supports all Rust versions released in the last 6 months. At the time of writing
the minimum supported Rust version is 1.71, but this could change at any time either from
one of our dependencies bumping their MSRV or by a new patch release of lettre.

## Example

This library requires Rust 1.71 or newer.
To use this library, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
lettre = "0.11"
```

```
use lettre::message::header::ContentType;
use lettre::transport::smtp::authentication::Credentials;
use lettre::{Message, SmtpTransport, Transport};

fn main() {
    let email = Message::builder()
        .from("NoBody <nobody@domain.tld>".parse().unwrap())
        .reply_to("Yuin <yuin@domain.tld>".parse().unwrap())
        .to("Hei <hei@domain.tld>".parse().unwrap())
        .subject("Happy new year")
        .header(ContentType::TEXT_PLAIN)
        .body(String::from("Be happy!"))
        .unwrap();

    let creds = Credentials::new("smtp_username".to_owned(), "smtp_password".to_owned());

    // Open a remote connection to gmail
    let mailer = SmtpTransport::relay("smtp.gmail.com")
        .unwrap()
        .credentials(creds)
        .build();

    // Send the email
    match mailer.send(&email) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Email sent successfully!"),
        Err(e) => panic!("Could not send email: {e:?}"),
    }
}
```

## Not sure of which connect options to use?

Clone the lettre git repository and run the following command (replacing `SMTP_HOST` with your SMTP server's hostname)

```
cargo run --example autoconfigure SMTP_HOST
```

## Testing

The `lettre` tests require an open mail server listening locally on port 2525 and the `sendmail` command. If you have python installed
such a server can be launched with `python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer 127.0.0.1:2525`

Alternatively only unit tests can be run by doing `cargo test --lib`.

## Troubleshooting

These are general steps to be followed when troubleshooting SMTP related issues.

* Ensure basic connectivity, ensure requisite ports are open and daemons are listening.
* Confirm that your service provider allows traffic on the ports being used for mail transfer.
* Check SMTP relay authentication and configuration.
* Validate your DNS records. (DMARC, SPF, DKIM, MX)
* Verify your SSL/TLS certificates are setup properly.
* Investigate if filtering, formatting, or filesize limits are causing messages to be lost, delayed, or blocked by relays or remote hosts.

### Description

Affected versions of lettre allowed argument injection
to the sendmail command. It was possible, using forged `to` addresses,
to pass arbitrary arguments to the sendmail executable.

Depending on the implementation (original sendmail, postfix, exim, etc.)
it could be possible in some cases to write email data into arbitrary files (using sendmail's
logging features).

The flaw is corrected by modifying the executed command to stop parsing arguments
before passing the destination addresses.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects the `sendmail` transport. Others, including `smtp`, are not
affected.

This vulnerability was reported by vin01.
