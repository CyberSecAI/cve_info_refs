Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the `lettre` crate's `sendmail` transport. Specifically, the library directly incorporates email recipient addresses into the command line arguments of the `sendmail` executable without proper sanitization or argument separation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Argument Injection:** The core vulnerability is an argument injection flaw. By crafting email addresses with specific characters, an attacker could inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the `sendmail` command.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The library fails to sanitize or escape the recipient addresses before passing them to the `sendmail` command, creating the attack surface.
*   **Direct Command Construction:** The `lettre` library directly constructs the command line string by concatenating arguments without proper separation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write (Potential):** Depending on the `sendmail` implementation being used (e.g., sendmail, postfix, exim), an attacker could potentially write email data to arbitrary files by abusing `sendmail`'s logging mechanisms or other features.
*   **Code Execution (Potential):** In some configurations or through specific arguments, it could be possible to achieve code execution by passing malicious parameters to the `sendmail` command.
*   **Information Disclosure (Potential):**  By manipulating command-line arguments, attackers might be able to access sensitive files or resources on the system.
*   **Abuse of sendmail functionalities:** Attackers can exploit other features of sendmail by passing arbitrary arguments.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Spoofing:**  An attacker crafts a malicious email message with specially crafted recipient addresses.
*   **Sendmail Transport:** The attacker must utilize the sendmail transport of the lettre crate to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send emails:** The attacker must be able to send emails that are processed by an application using the affected version of the `lettre` crate's `sendmail` transport.
*   **No specific privilege:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability as it is related to the way arguments are parsed by sendmail.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects `lettre` versions prior to 0.7.1, 0.8.4, and 0.9.5 as well as alpha versions before 0.10.0-alpha.4.
*   **Patched Versions:** Versions 0.7.1, 0.8.4, 0.9.5, and 0.10.0-alpha.4 and later releases of the crate contain the fix.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves modifying the way the command is constructed to stop argument parsing before passing the destination addresses to the sendmail executable, preventing the injection of malicious arguments by using "--".
*   **Affected Transport:**  The vulnerability is only present in the `sendmail` transport of the lettre crate. Other transports such as SMTP are not affected.

This vulnerability is categorized as CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')). The provided CVSS score is 5.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N, indicating a moderate severity vulnerability exploitable over a network with low complexity and no user interaction.
