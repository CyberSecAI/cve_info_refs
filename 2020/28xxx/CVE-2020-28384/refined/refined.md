Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28384:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length when parsing PAR files. Specifically, the application fails to validate the length of the data before copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The core vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The application copies user-controlled data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted PAR file.
*   **Malicious Page:**  User interaction is needed, in the form of visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce the user to either open a malicious PAR file or visit a malicious web page.
*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PAR file with a specially crafted structure.
* **Remote**: The attacker can be remote.

**Affected Products:**

*   Siemens Solid Edge Viewer
*   Siemens Solid Edge (Solid Edge SE2020, Solid Edge SE2021)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8, indicating high severity.
*   Siemens has released updates to address this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is also present in Solid Edge when parsing PAR files, while the ZDI advisory identifies the vulnerability in Solid Edge Viewer.
