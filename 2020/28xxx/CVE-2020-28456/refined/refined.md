Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the s-cart/core e-commerce platform. Specifically, user-provided data, particularly within the `form_attr` parameter when adding products to the cart, is not being sanitized or escaped before being stored and later displayed in the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to neutralize special characters that could be interpreted as code by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. When an administrator views or interacts with the affected data in the admin panel, the malicious script will execute within the administrator's browser. This could lead to:
*   Account takeover of the administrator if the injected script steals cookies or session information.
*   Exposure of sensitive information.
*   Access to privileged services and functionalities.
*   Delivery of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-provided input, specifically the `form_attr` parameter during the "add to cart" process. This input is stored and later rendered in the admin panel without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious payload. The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request while adding product to the cart. The injected script executes when an administrator accesses the data in the admin panel.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.4 of the `s-cart/core` package.
*   The fix involved implementing the `sc_clean` function to sanitize user inputs.
*   The injected payload is stored on the server and is executed when the admin views the related order.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Abdul Muhaimin and assigned the Snyk ID SNYK-PHP-SCARTCORE-1047609.
*   The CVSS score is 6.3 (Medium).
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
