Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-28348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the Docker file sandbox feature of HashiCorp Nomad. Specifically, it occurs when the Docker driver's volume mount type is used, and when client configurations do not restrict volume mounts to within the allocation's path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core vulnerability is a path traversal flaw that allows a malicious actor to escape the intended file sandbox.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** Nomad versions prior to the patched ones did not enforce strict restrictions on volume mounts, thus exposing the clients to exploitation if not explicitly configured.
- **Docker Driver Volume Mount:** The `volume` mount type in the Docker task driver is the attack vector

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Host File System Access:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to mount and access the host file system of a Nomad client agent from within a container.
- **Sandbox Subversion:** The default Docker file sandbox, designed to isolate tasks, can be bypassed.
- **Potential Data Exfiltration/Modification**: With full access to the host filesystem, an attacker may exfiltrate sensitive data or modify critical configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Job Submission:** An operator who has the ability to submit jobs to the Nomad cluster can exploit this flaw.
- **Docker Task Driver:** The attack requires crafting a malicious job spec that uses the Docker task driver along with volume mounts.
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based (CVSS Attack Vector is Network).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges to submit jobs.
- **Network Access:** The attacker should be able to communicate with the Nomad cluster over the network.
- **Knowledge of Nomad:** The attacker would need a basic understanding of how to submit Nomad jobs.

**Affected Versions:**
- Versions 0.9.0 up to 0.12.7
- Versions 0.11.0-beta1 up to 0.11.7
- Versions 0.12.0-beta1 up to 0.12.8

**Patched Versions:**
- 0.10.8
- 0.11.7
- 0.12.8

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is most severe when host file system access is not explicitly disabled or if volume mounts outside the allocation's path are not restricted.
- The issue is classified as having a "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.5.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-22 (Path Traversal).
