Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28426

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `kill-process-on-port` npm package, specifically within the `a.getProcessPortId` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The `getProcessPortId` function does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying shell execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used. This can lead to various consequences, including:
    - Data modification
    - Data exfiltration
    - Denial of service
    - Complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing malicious input to the `getProcessPortId` function. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject commands using shell metacharacters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the vulnerable `getProcessPortId` function.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Information:**
-  The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.3 (High).
- There is currently no fix available for the vulnerability, meaning no patched version exists.
- Snyk has a proof of concept for this vulnerability.
- Snyk has a an interactive lesson regarding command injection that may be helpful.
