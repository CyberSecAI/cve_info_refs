The provided content discusses a vulnerability in the Plum IK-401 industrial modem, which is indeed related to CVE-2020-28946. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration of the webserver on the Plum IK-401 modem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** The misconfigured webserver allowed for the retrieval of the device's configuration file without requiring any authentication.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The configuration file contained a hashed version of the administrator's password. While hashed, this can still be a security risk, as it could be cracked by an attacker.
*   **Remote Access:** The device was accessible through the Internet, which increased the risk of exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Device Configuration Manipulation:** After obtaining the hashed password (and potentially cracking it), an attacker could log into the device's web interface.
*   **Network Configuration Modification:** This allows the attacker to change the device's network settings.
*   **Industrial Protocol Communication:** The attacker could use the web interface to directly communicate with other devices on the industrial network using industrial protocols. This could allow for malicious manipulation of industrial processes and systems.
*   **Compromise of Industrial Control Systems (ICS):** Because the modem is frequently used in the gas and water industries, a successful exploitation could potentially compromise critical infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability was exploitable remotely via the Internet due to the exposed webserver.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers could scan for vulnerable devices directly connected to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the device's web interface over the internet.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** Basic web request knowledge to download the configuration file.
*   **Password Cracking Capabilities:** To gain full access, the attacker would need to attempt to crack the obtained hashed password.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by CERT Polska in September 2020.
*   The vendor (Plum) was notified and released a patch in early October 2020.
*   The recommended firmware update is version 1.02 or later.
*   The content highlights the broader issue of industrial control systems being connected to the internet without proper security measures.
*   CERT Polska collaborated with other CERTs and CISA on this issue
