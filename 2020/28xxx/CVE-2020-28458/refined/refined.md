Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Prototype Pollution** issue in the `datatables.net` JavaScript library.
*   It stems from an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (SNYK-JS-DATATABLESNET-598806). The fix introduced a check for `__proto__` but didn't account for the `constructor` property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete fix:** The initial fix only blocked modification of the `__proto__` property, leaving the `constructor` property still vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Prototype pollution:** The ability to inject properties into JavaScript object prototypes. This allows an attacker to modify the base object prototype by injecting malicious values, leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Unsafe object data setting:** The `_fnSetObjectDataFn` function is used to set object data based on a provided path. If the path contains `constructor`, it is not properly sanitized, allowing the attacker to modify the prototype via the constructor property

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information could be disclosed.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could add or modify data within the application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype, an attacker could cause exceptions and application crashes leading to DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (potential):** In specific scenarios where the code evaluates object attributes, this could lead to remote code execution by manipulating the prototype.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers could inject properties that the codebase relies on for informative value or security such as cookies or tokens, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, making it accessible to attackers beyond local networks, potentially including the entire internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation can occur without any user interaction.
*   The attacker needs to control the input, specifically the property name, which is then used to set a value to the object via the `_fnSetObjectDataFn` function.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   `datatables.net` versions prior to 1.10.23 (Snyk)
    *   `org.webjars.bower:datatables.net` versions before 1.10.25 (Snyk)
    *   `org.webjars.npm:datatables.net` versions before 2.1.2 (Snyk)
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC is provided showing how to use the `_fnSetObjectDataFn` function to pollute the prototype.
*  **NetApp Advisory:** Mentions that the vulnerability affects multiple NetApp products incorporating IBM Cognos Analytics (versions 12.0.0 through 12.0.1, 11.2.0 through 11.2.4 FP2, and 11.1.1 through 11.1.7 FP7).

**Mitigation:**
* Upgrade `datatables.net` to version 1.10.23 or higher or the versions mentioned for the webjar packages
* Consider using objects without prototypes (`Object.create(null)`) to break the prototype chain.
* Use `Map` instead of `Object`.

In summary, CVE-2020-28458 is a high-severity prototype pollution vulnerability due to an incomplete fix in `datatables.net`. It can be exploited remotely without any required user interaction or privileges and can lead to information disclosure, data modification, DoS, or potentially remote code execution.
