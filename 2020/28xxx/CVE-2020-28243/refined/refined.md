  "CVE-2020-28243": {
    "Description": "A command injection vulnerability in SaltStackâ€™s Salt allows privilege escalation via specially crafted process names on a minion when the master calls restartcheck.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The minion's `restartcheck` is vulnerable to command injection via a crafted process name when this process has open file descriptors associated with `(deleted)` at the end of a filename. The vulnerable code uses `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` where the command can be manipulated by an attacker via a crafted process name.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Local Privilege Escalation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root from any user able to create files on the minion in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted process names with shell injection characters",
      "Open file descriptors to files ending with `(deleted)`",
      "Writable directory not explicitly forbidden by SaltStack"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create files in writable directories on the minion that are not explicitly forbidden by SaltStack. The attacker also needs to influence process names, which can be done by renaming the binary or script being run. The SaltStack master needs to call `restartcheck.restartcheck` on this minion to trigger the exploit."
