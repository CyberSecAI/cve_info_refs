- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of uploaded ZIP archive contents during plugin installation. The application extracts the ZIP file before performing security checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unrestricted file upload leading to arbitrary code execution
    - Inadequate input validation during plugin installation
    - The application attempts to prevent malicious uploads by looking for a specific directory (`/Upload/Plugins/`) in the unzipped content. However, an attacker can bypass this by creating a zip file without this directory, causing an exception during file listing, and preventing the security check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the server by uploading a crafted ZIP archive containing malicious PHP code (e.g., a webshell).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Attacker uploads a crafted ZIP file via the plugin import functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated access as an administrator.
    - Ability to navigate to the plugin import functionality within the application
