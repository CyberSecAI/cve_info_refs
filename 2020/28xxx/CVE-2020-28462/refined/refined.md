Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28462

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `ion-parser` library's parsing logic, which is susceptible to Prototype Pollution. Specifically, it occurs when parsing a malicious INI (TOML in this case) file. The parser doesn't properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects by using the `__proto__` property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution. The parser allows modification of the `__proto__` property which leads to the ability to modify Object prototypes, impacting other objects in the JavaScript application.
* **Unsafe Parsing:** The parser does not validate or sanitize the input to prevent malicious properties from being set on prototypes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By polluting object prototypes with unexpected values or invalid data types the application can crash due to unexpected behavior, leading to a denial of service.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates attributes from objects and executes that evaluation, it can be exploited to achieve RCE by polluting specific attributes.
* **Property Injection:** An attacker can inject properties to alter the applicationâ€™s behavior, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption if application code uses those properties.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Malicious Input:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted TOML file that uses the `__proto__` property to inject malicious data.
* **Parsing:** The application must parse this malicious input using the vulnerable version of `ion-parser` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TOML file that will be parsed by an application using the vulnerable `ion-parser` library. No special access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

* There isn't a fix available for the vulnerable package, meaning users must avoid using it or find other workarounds.
* The proof-of-concept provided demonstrates how the `__proto__` property can be used to inject properties into the base Object prototype.
* The vulnerability can be triggered from network facing applications when they parse attacker controlled inputs.
* Snyk's CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.3 (high) while NVD gives it a 9.8 (critical) rating.

This vulnerability is a client side vulnerability because it is triggered in the code that runs in the client's browser. It is not a server-side vulnerability.
