Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the Froxlor Server Management Panel v0.10.16 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser
to web-application requests from the application-side.
The persistent cross site web vulnerability is located in the `username`, `name` and `firstname` input fields of the customer
add or registration module. Remote attackers are able to add customers with malicious script code as firstname or name to
manipulate in the backend the `admin\_customers.php` and `customers.php` files. The injection point is the registration
or customer add/edit module and the execution occurs on preview of the traffic module in the admin backend. The request
method to inject is POST and the attack vector is persistent located on the application-side. In a valid attack case the
remote attacker uses a customer or reseller account to inject the payload as name to provoke an execute in the insecure
backend module.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Username
[+] Name
[+] Firstname
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Customers
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] name
[+] firstname
Affected File(s):
[+] admin\_customers.php
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privilege user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Register or login with a low privilege user account
2. Open the profile account section
3. Change the name and firstname or include in the registration process
Note: Inject test payload to vulnerable marked input fields
4. Save or submit the input via form
5. Wait until an admin or higher privileged user role opens the traffic stats to execute
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent input validation web vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by follwing the next steps ...
1. Validate and escape the content of the vulnerable username, name and firstname input fields
2. Restrict the input fields and disallow specialchars on inputs to filter
3. Parse the two output location and escape or secure encode the content
4. Encode in the edit formular the results on check
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent validation web vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium.
