- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `username`, `name`, and `firstname` fields of the customer add or registration module. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate input validation and output sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote attackers can inject malicious script code into the `username`, `name`, and `firstname` input fields during customer registration or profile editing.
    - The injected code is stored persistently and executed when an administrator or higher-privileged user views the traffic statistics page which includes user information.
    - The attack vector is persistent and located on the application side.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs a low-privilege user account (customer or reseller).
    - The attacker needs the ability to access and modify user profile data.
    - The attacker needs an admin or higher privileged user to view the `admin_traffic.php` page to trigger the malicious code execution.
