Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-28395:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key**. Specifically, the affected Siemens SCALANCE X devices do not generate a new, unique private key after a factory reset. Instead they reuse the same key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The devices fail to generate a unique cryptographic key after a factory reset, relying on a static, pre-defined key.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit allows an attacker to perform a **man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack**.
*   The attacker can **decrypt previously captured network traffic** that was encrypted using the compromised key.
*   This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information transmitted across the network.
*   The attacker can also potentially modify traffic.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Low attack complexity:** Exploitation requires low skill level/ effort to perform.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the affected Siemens device and other devices.
*   They must be able to intercept and capture the encrypted traffic.
*   They do not require prior privileges or user interaction to execute the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1, indicating critical severity.
*   The advisory also mentions that the vulnerability was discovered internally by Siemens.
*   There are mitigation steps provided by Siemens, specifically, updating the device firmware, and updating self-signed and hardcoded device certificates.
*   The advisory also highlights the importance of implementing general security measures such as protecting network access.

**Affected Products:**

*   SCALANCE X-200RNA switch family: All versions prior to v3.2.7
*   SCALANCE X-300 switch family (incl. X408 and SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v4.1.0

The advisory also discusses another related vulnerability, CVE-2020-28391, which also involves hardcoded keys. However CVE-2020-28391 only applies to SCALANCE X-200 and X-200IRT family devices, whereas CVE-2020-28395 is applicable to SCALANCE X-200RNA and X-300 family devices.
