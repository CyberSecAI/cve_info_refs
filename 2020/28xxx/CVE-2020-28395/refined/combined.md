ICS Advisory
# Siemens SCALANCE X Switches (Update C)

Last RevisedDecember 16, 2022
Alert CodeICSA-21-012-02

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.1**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** Siemens
* **Equipment:** SCALANCE X200, X200IRT, X300
* **Vulnerabilities:** Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

## 2. UPDATE INFORMATION

This updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-21-012-02 Siemens SCALANCE X Switches (Update B) that was published February 14, 2021, to the ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov.

## 3. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt previously captured traffic.

## 4. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Siemens products are affected:

* SCALANCE X-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v5.2.5

**--------- Begin Update C Part 1 of 2 ---------**

* SCALANCE X-200RNA switch family: All versions prior to v3.2.7

**--------- End Update C Part 1 of 2 ---------**

* SCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v5.5.0
* SCALANCE X-300 switch family (incl. X408 and SIPLUS NET variants): All versions prior to v4.1.0

### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)

Devices create a new unique key upon factory reset, except when used with C-PLUG. When used with C-PLUG the devices use the hardcoded private RSA-key shipped with the firmware-image. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create a man-in-the-middle situation and decrypt previously captured traffic.

[CVE-2020-28391](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28391) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)).

#### 4.2.2    [USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)

Devices do not create a new unique private key after factory reset. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create a man-in-the-middle situation and decrypt previously captured traffic.

[CVE-2020-28395](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28395) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)).

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens ProductCERT reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Siemens recommends applying updates where available:

* SCALANCE X-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): [Update to v5.2.5 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109801131/)

**--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

* SCALANCE X-200RNA switch family: [Update to v3.2.7 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109814809/)

**--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

* SCALANCE X-300 switch family (incl. X408 and SIPLUS NET variants): [Update to v4.1.0 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109773547/)
* SCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): [Update to v5.5.0 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109792534/)

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Update the default self-signed device X.509 certificates with own trusted certificate.
* Update the default hardcoded X.509 certificates from the firmware image (fingerprints SHA-1: F2:C8:3B:8F:86:27:74:AA:60:EC:D4:A0:CF:0D:BE:A6:D1:FE:22:12 and SHA-256: 25:60:DB:B3: F9:07:9D:69:0E:DD:A9:EB:4E:1C:D5:8E:AF:79:16:C3:C8:13:A6:F6:59:AD:05:E4:6F:77:F7:72)

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA-274900](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-274900.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28391

Devices create a new unique key upon factory reset, except when used with C-PLUG. When used
with C-PLUG the devices use the hardcoded private RSA-key shipped with the ﬁrmware-image. An
attacker could leverage this situation to a man-in-the-middle situation and decrypt previously captured
trafﬁc.
