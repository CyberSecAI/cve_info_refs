- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `fread` function reads data from the input file into a fixed-size stack buffer within a while loop. The loop continues based on the input file's size, which can cause a stack-based buffer overflow if the file size exceeds the buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted `.obj` file is provided as input to the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious `.obj` file to the PrusaSlicer application.
