Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the administrator's password in plain text through an API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unprotected Transport of Credentials (CWE-523):** The administrator's password is sent in clear text within the response to an authenticated API request.
*   **Hardcoded API Credentials (dependency):** This vulnerability is dependent on the presence of hardcoded API credentials from a previous vulnerability (CVE-2020-28329) to authenticate the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to the administrator's password. With this password, an attacker can log into the web interface and make any configuration changes, potentially leading to complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   **API Request:** The attacker sends an authenticated request to a specific API endpoint (`https://<device_ip>:4001/w1.0`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have the hardcoded API credentials (from CVE-2020-28329) to authenticate to the API endpoint.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the targeted device.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W
*   **Affected Version:** 2.5.1.8
*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `https://<device_ip>:4001/w1.0`
*   **Mitigation:** Firmware update to version 2.5.3.12
