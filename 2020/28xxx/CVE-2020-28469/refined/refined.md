Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-28469:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28469
*   **Affected Package:** `glob-parent` (npm package) and `org.webjars.npm:glob-parent` (Maven package)
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** `glob-parent` versions >=3.0.1 and <5.1.2,  `org.webjars.npm:glob-parent` versions >=3.1.0 and <5.1.2
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `enclosure` regex used to check for strings ending in an enclosure containing a path separator.
*   **Weakness:** Inefficient regular expression that can lead to catastrophic backtracking, resulting in excessive CPU consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft malicious input strings that cause the vulnerable regular expression to take an excessive amount of time to process. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **CPU Exhaustion:** The ReDoS vulnerability can cause the system to excessively consume CPU resources, impacting performance and potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and can be exploited remotely over the internet.
*   **Input Manipulation:** Attackers can send crafted input strings to the vulnerable function, triggering the catastrophic backtracking in the regex.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior access or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.
*   **Network access:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable regex is used to check strings ending in an enclosure containing a path separator.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) shows how to generate an attack string that causes the regex engine to backtrack excessively.
*   The PoC uses a string that starts with a curly brace `{` followed by a large number of forward slashes `/`.
*   The vulnerability is caused by the way the regex engine evaluates the expression, leading to exponential growth in processing time for specific inputs.
*   The issue was fixed in version 5.1.2 of the package.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Snyk vulnerability database identifies this issue with the IDs SNYK-JS-GLOBPARENT-1016905 and SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1059092.
*   The advisory for `org.webjars.bowergithub.es128:glob-parent` was revoked as it was deemed not a vulnerability, though it shares the same CVE ID.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `f923116` and included in version 5.1.2
*   The GitHub pull request #36 addresses the ReDoS issue.

**Summary:**

The `glob-parent` library had a ReDoS vulnerability due to an inefficient regular expression. Attackers could exploit this by sending specially crafted strings to trigger catastrophic backtracking, leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.1.2.
