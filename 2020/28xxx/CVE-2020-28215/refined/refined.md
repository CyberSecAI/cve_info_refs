Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-28215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)** vulnerability in the Schneider Electric Easergy T300 product. Specifically, the access control checks are not applied consistently.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The product lacks proper authorization checks. This means that an attacker can access resources without being properly authorized, potentially leading to information exposure, denial of service, and remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the internal product LAN.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition, disrupting the normal operation of the device.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker could achieve remote code execution, allowing them to take full control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   The specific attack vector involves inconsistent application of access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Required Privileges (PR:N):** The attacker does not require any prior privileges or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **High Attack Complexity (AC:H):**  The attacker must overcome some challenges to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional details:**

*   The affected product is Schneider Electric Easergy T300 with firmware Versions 2.7 and prior.
*  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.7 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H.
*   The advisory mentions that a high skill level is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
