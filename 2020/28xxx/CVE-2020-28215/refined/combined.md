[CVE-2020-28215](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28215) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)

The affected product is vulnerable to a missing encryption of sensitive data vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to read network traffic over HTTP protocol.

[CVE-2020-28216](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28216) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [MISSING ENCRYPTION OF SENSITIVE DATA CWE-311](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)

The affected product is vulnerable to a missing encryption of sensitive data vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to read network traffic over IEC60870-5-104 protocol.

[CVE-2020-28217](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28217) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L)).

#### 3.2.5    [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF RENDERED UI LAYERS OR FRAMES CWE-1021](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1021.html)

The affected product is vulnerable due to an improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to trick a user into initiating an unintended action.

[CVE-2020-28218](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28218) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Schneider Electric recommends users upgrade to v2.7.1, which is available from the [Schneider Electric Customer Care Center](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/contacts.jsp). Alternatively, users may disable port forwarding in the product firewall.

Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:

* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.
* Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in “Program” mode.
* Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for which the devices are intended.
* Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.) before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
* Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network, besides the intended network, to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric [Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices](https://www.se.com/us/en/download/document/7EN52-0390/) document.

Refer to Schneider Electric’s security bulletin [SEVD-2020-315-06](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-315-06/) for specific mitigation details.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.
