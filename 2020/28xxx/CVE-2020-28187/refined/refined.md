Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. It stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input used when constructing file paths. Specifically, the `filename` parameter in the `/tos/index.php?editor/fileGet` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application allows the use of `../` sequences in the `filename` parameter. This enables an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory scope and access arbitrary files on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File System Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system. The provided example demonstrates the ability to read `/etc/shadow`, which contains user password hashes, by using directory traversal. This could lead to complete compromise of the system if the attacker is able to crack the hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/tos/index.php?editor/fileGet`.
*   **Manipulated Parameter:** The `filename` parameter is manipulated to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/shadow`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The provided example shows that an authenticated session is required to exploit this vulnerability using a valid session cookie (`PHPSESSID`).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected TerraMaster TOS device. This means network connectivity to the device is required.
