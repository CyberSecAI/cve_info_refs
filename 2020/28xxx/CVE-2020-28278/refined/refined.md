Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28278:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `set()` function of the `shvl` npm module. Specifically, the function doesn't check if the provided `path` is attempting to modify the object's prototype.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is that an attacker can use the `set()` function to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects by providing a specially crafted `path` string containing `__proto__`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security issues.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype, an attacker could potentially disrupt the application's functionality leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, prototype pollution can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution. By manipulating prototype properties, an attacker may be able to influence application behavior or inject malicious code.
- **Data Tampering**: By modifying properties on the prototype, an attacker can alter the expected behavior of the application which might lead to unauthorized data modification or access.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `set()` function of the `shvl` module. An attacker needs to control the `path` parameter passed to this function. The `path` parameter can be controlled through user input in an application using the `shvl` library or through other means of data injection.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to pass data to the vulnerable `set()` function within the context of an application using the `shvl` library.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the `shvl` library usage and the vulnerability to craft a malicious payload with `__proto__` within the path parameter.
- No specific user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code in `index.js` (before the fix) for the `set()` function looks like this:
  ```javascript
  export function set (object, path, val, obj) {
    return ((path = path.split ? path.split('.') : path.slice(0)).slice(0, -1).reduce(function (obj, p) {
      return obj[p] = obj[p] || {};
    }, obj = object)[path.pop()] = val), object;
  };
  ```
- The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code uses `path.split('.')` and `obj[p] = obj[p] || {};` recursively without validating the parts of the path, leading to the ability to modify the object prototype with the `__proto__` property.
- The proof of concept code demonstrates how this vulnerability can be exploited:
  ```javascript
  const shvl = require('shvl');
  var obj = {}
  console.log("Before : " + obj.isAdmin);
  shvl.set(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', true);
  console.log("After : " + obj.isAdmin);
  ```
- The fix for this issue involved adding a check for `__proto__` in the path.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was present in `shvl` versions 1.0.0 through 2.0.1.
- No fix version is explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, but a patch was made to prevent prototype pollution.
- The vulnerability has a high CVSS score of 9.8, with a network attack vector and low complexity.
