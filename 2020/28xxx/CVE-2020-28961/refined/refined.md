- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The application lacks proper input validation, allowing a low-privileged user to inject malicious script code into the `company` name parameter of the `/admin/clients/client` module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious sources, and manipulation of affected application modules. The injected script executes when an admin or privileged user attempts to print client data via the export function.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the `company` parameter of the `/admin/clients/client` (Customer) module, accessible through a POST request. The malicious code is executed when a privileged user accesses the print function, leading to script execution within a new tab context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a low-privileged user account.
