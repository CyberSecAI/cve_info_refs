Package        : qemu
Version        : 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-15469 CVE-2020-15859 CVE-2020-25084 CVE-2020-28916
                 CVE-2020-29130 CVE-2020-29443 CVE-2021-20181 CVE-2021-20221
Debian Bug     : 970253 965978 970539 974687 976388

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator (notably used in KVM and Xen HVM virtualization). An attacker
could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS), information leak, and
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU
process on the host.

CVE-2020-15469

    A MemoryRegionOps object may lack read/write callback methods,
    leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2020-15859

    QEMU has a use-after-free in hw/net/e1000e_core.c because a guest
    OS user can trigger an e1000e packet with the data's address set
    to the e1000e's MMIO address.

CVE-2020-25084

    QEMU has a use-after-free in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c because the
    usb_packet_map return value is not checked.

CVE-2020-28916

    hw/net/e1000e_core.c has an infinite loop via an RX descriptor
    with a NULL buffer address.

CVE-2020-29130

    slirp.c has a buffer over-read because it tries to read a certain
    amount of header data even if that exceeds the total packet
    length.

CVE-2020-29443

    ide_atapi_cmd_reply_end in hw/ide/atapi.c allows out-of-bounds
    read access because a buffer index is not validated.

CVE-2021-20181

    9pfs: ZDI-CAN-10904: QEMU Plan 9 file system TOCTOU privilege
    escalation vulnerability.

CVE-2021-20221

    aarch64: GIC: out-of-bound heap buffer access via an interrupt ID
    field.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/qemu>

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

Subject: CVE-2020-28916 QEMU: e1000e: infinite loop scenario in case of null
 packet descriptor

   Hello,

An infinite loop issue was found in the e1000e device emulator in QEMU. The
issue could occur while receiving packets via e1000e_write_packet_to_guest()
routine, if the receive(RX) descriptor has NULL buffer address. A privileged
guest user may use this flaw to induce a DoS scenario on the host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-11/msg03185.html>

This issue was reported by Cheol-woo Myung.

CVE-2020-28916 assigned via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.
