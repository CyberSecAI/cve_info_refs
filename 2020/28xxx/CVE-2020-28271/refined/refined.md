Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `set()` function of the `deephas` npm module. Specifically, the function doesn't check if the provided `path` is attempting to modify an object's prototype (`__proto__`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The `set()` function allows an attacker to inject properties into the `__proto__` of an object. This is a critical issue because the `__proto__` is the prototype of all objects created using the same constructor, which means modifications to the prototype will affect all instances.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `set()` function does not validate the input, specifically the path, which makes it possible to inject `__proto__` in the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype, an attacker can potentially disrupt the application's functionality.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain scenarios, prototype pollution can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution. This could happen if the polluted prototype is used in a way where attacker-controlled data is then used to execute code.
*   **Manipulation of Object Properties:**  An attacker can add or modify properties that are not intended to be changed, which could lead to unexpected or malicious behavior

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via network.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `set()` function with a crafted `path` argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction.
*   The attacker needs the ability to call the `set()` function with a malicious payload containing `__proto__`.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable `set()` function takes three arguments: `target` (the object to modify), `path` (the property path, a string), and `val` (the value to set).
*   The vulnerability occurs when the `path` includes `__proto__`. Because of a lack of validation, the provided `val` is directly set on the prototype.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) code snippet is provided that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:
    ```javascript
    var dh = require("deephas");
    var obj = {};
    console.log(obj.isAdmin);
    dh.set(obj,'__proto__.isAdmin','true');
    console.log(obj.isAdmin);
    ```
*   The fix involves checking for `__proto__` in the path and preventing its modification.

**Affected Versions:**

*   `deephas` versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.5 are affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0.7. Upgrading is the recommended course of action.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Mend.io vulnerability database entry provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 and CVSS v2 score of 7.5, indicating the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is classified under CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes) and CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes).
