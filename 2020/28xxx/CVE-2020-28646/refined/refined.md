Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28646:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The ownCloud Desktop Client was configured to load development plugins from specific directories if they were present. This was an unintentional behavior in release builds that was meant only for development.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **DLL injection:** The client's behavior of loading plugins from arbitrary directories allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in one of these directories. When the client is launched, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed within the context of the application.
- **Process Control (CWE-114):** The vulnerability stems from improper control over which processes or libraries are allowed to be loaded by the client.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the ownCloud desktop client.
- **Compromise of local system:** This can lead to data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data (C:L), modify data (I:L) and cause the application to behave unexpectedly (A:L).

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine where the ownCloud desktop client is installed, and has to be able to write files into the specific plugin directories.
- **User Interaction:** The user must launch the vulnerable client to trigger the loading of the malicious DLL

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have local access to the target system where the ownCloud desktop client is installed.
- The attacker needs write access to the plugin directories to drop a malicious DLL.
- The attacker needs the user to launch the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity (CVSS v3 Base Score 5.3).
- Affected versions are below ownCloud Desktop client version 2.7.
- The fix was to only set the plugin search path in development builds.
