# passwordcheck for rclone config files

In [rclone/rclone#4783](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783) a security issue was
found which meant that passwords generated by "rclone config" might be
insecure.

This program checks your rclone config file for any of those
passwords.

## Installation

Download the relevant zip file for your OS and architecture from here:

* <https://github.com/rclone/passwordcheck/releases>

Unpack the zip archive - use `unzip archive.zip` on Linux/macOS - use
Explorer on Windows.

Open a terminal and change directory to the place you unpacked the zip
file.

First find where your rclone config file is.

```
 rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/USER/.rclone.conf

```

Now run the utility with this as an argument

```
./passwordcheck /home/USER/.rclone.conf

```

Note that it may take 10 minutes or more to run. At the end it will
print a report showing any insecure passwords found.

For example:

```
$ ./passwordcheck ~/.rclone.conf
2020/11/19 14:01:49 found 269 remote definitions
2020/11/19 14:01:49 found 54 passwords generated by rclone config which need checking

# [Rclone 1.53.3 release](/t/rclone-1-53-3-release/20569)

Rclone 1.53.3 has been released. Find it here <https://rclone.org/downloads/>

This is a security fix release to fix [CVE-2020-28924](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28924).

Some passwords generated with `rclone config` may be insecure. In particular if you used the 'g' generate option with rclone v1.49 - v1.53.2 then your password will based on the second it was generated in. This means that there are fixed number of passwords in that period ~33 million.

* See [issue #4783](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783) for more details
* See [the checking tool](https://github.com/rclone/passwordcheck) which can check config file for insecure passwords
* This was caused by a bit of careless refactoring by me - many apologies ![:frowning:](https://forum.rclone.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9 ":frowning:")

## FAQ for security issue

### Am I affected?

If you have used `rclone config` to generate a password for you feature then you might be. Run the [the checking tool](https://github.com/rclone/passwordcheck) to find out for sure

### I've got an affected password - do I need to change it?

I recommend you change it, especially if it is for access to a remote service (eg FTP server).

### What about crypt backends

I imagine most of these passwords are used in crypt backends.

For it to cause your private data to become public, firstly the encrypted data needs to become public, then the attacker would need to decode your encrypted data by guessing passwords.

If the attacker has no knowledge of when you made your key then there are about 33 million possible passwords. Because of the use of [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) in rclone it takes about 50mS to check a key on my laptop. So to search the whole space would take about 19 CPU days which is a lot but well within reach of a determined attacker.

### How do I change my crypt password

Unfortunately you will have to download and upload the data. The procedure would be:

* create a new crypt wrapping a new directory on the existing remote
* `rclone copy` or `rclone move` from old to new

## v1.53.3 - 2020-11-19

[See commits](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/compare/v1.53.2...v1.53.3)

  + random: Fix incorrect use of `math/rand` instead of `crypto/rand` CVE-2020-28924 (Nick Craig-Wood)

hi, thanks for taking this seriously.

i am very confused about the output

i ran the check on two .config files.

* a password protected rclone.conf files, and the check less then one second
* plain text .conf files and the check took 50s

  each command had very different output

here is the output of both

```
passwordcheck c:\data\rclone\scripts\rclone.conf
*** No insecure passwords found

Oh, yes, you'll have to decrypt the config. I should write that in the help I think.

please, i think the tool needs to be fixed, changing the documentation is not enough in this case.

* have the tool check for a password protected .conf file and complain
* add a flag to supply a password to allow the tool to decrypt the .conf file and then check

otherwise, the tool gives a false negative.

many users will think that their passwords are secure.

I've uploaded v1.0.1 of the tool which

* checks if the config file is encrypted and complains
* checks if no passwords were found and complains

Let me know if you find anything else which needs changing ![:slight_smile:](https://forum.rclone.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9 ":slight_smile:")

[@ncw](/u/ncw) thanks for patching rclone so quickly and making it easy to check. Thankfully I'm in the clear as downloading and uploading would have been a very arduous task for me.

The check only took 13.4s for me ![:slight_smile:](https://forum.rclone.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9 ":slight_smile:") It used up 100% of my CPU so it'd be worth letting people know not to do it at an important time, as my work Teams call went bonkers for a few seconds!

Yes it is quite CPU intensive. I have probably the most complicated rclone.conf in existence and it took about 15 minutes to check my config file.

That is about 10x quicker than my laptop though! What kind of rocket is that?

[@ncw](/u/ncw) Does the passwordcheck also work if it's a rclone generated password + rclone generated salt?

It does check them both, but if you find one of them compromised you should change both.

Foo! The docker build has broken. I'll attempt to fix up!

Sorry for this dumb question but if I have created a password myself but used the salt from rclone, I'm somewhat good?

hi,

the only way to know is to run the checker.

If the salt is a bad password then the security would rest on how good your password is. If it is a good one then you are effectively operating without salt which is OK if not recommended.

does the checker tool check `both` passwords `and` salts?

It does. However if you auto generated both `password` and `salt` then it will only detect the `password` as the random number generator will have moved on. You should change both if the `password` is a problem.

| [Description](#c0)  filip ambroz    2020-11-19 21:48:21 UTC  ``` Due to the use of a weak random number generator, the password generator has been producing weak passwords with much less entropy than advertised. The suggested passwords depend deterministically on the time the second rclone was started. This limits the entropy of the passwords.  It would be possible to make a dictionary of all possible passwords with about 38 million entries per password length. This would make decryption of secret material possible with a plausible amount of effort.  Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  filip ambroz    2020-11-19 21:50:08 UTC  ``` NVD Link: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28924> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-11-24 10:35:50 UTC  ``` (We don't put versioned atoms in summary unless it's representing fixed versions in tree).

# Downloads

Rclone is single executable (`rclone`, or `rclone.exe` on Windows) that you can
simply download as a zip archive and extract into a location of your choosing.
See the [install](https://rclone.org/install/) documentation for more details.

## Release v1.69.0 OS requirements

| OS | Minimum Version |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | Kernel 2.6.32 (or later depending on architecture, e.g. 3.1 on ARMv5) |
| macOS (Intel) | 10.15 (Catalina) |
| macOS (ARM64) | 11 (Big Sur) |
| Windows | 10, Server 2016 |
| FreeBSD | 12.2 |
| OpenBSD | 6.9 |

See [minimum requirements](https://go.dev/wiki/MinimumRequirements) and other [platform specific information](https://go.dev/wiki/#platform-specific-information) in Go Wiki for more details.

## Release v1.69.0

| Arch-OS | Windows | macOS | Linux | .deb | .rpm | FreeBSD | NetBSD | OpenBSD | Plan9 | Solaris |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intel/AMD - 64 Bit |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Intel/AMD - 32 Bit |  | - |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | - |
| ARMv5 - 32 Bit NOHF | - | - |  |  |  |  |  | - | - | - |
| ARMv6 - 32 Bit | - | - |  |  |  |  |  | - | - | - |
| ARMv7 - 32 Bit | - | - |  |  |  |  |  | - | - | - |
| ARM - 64 Bit |  |  |  |  |  | - | - | - | - | - |
| MIPS - Big Endian | - | - |  |  |  | - | - | - | - | - |
| MIPS - Little Endian | - | - |  |  |  | - | - | - | - | - |

You can also find a [mirror of the downloads on GitHub](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/releases/tag/v1.69.0).

See also [Android builds](https://beta.rclone.org/v1.69.0/testbuilds/).
These are built as part of the official release, but haven't been
adopted as first class builds yet.

See [the release signing docs](/release_signing/) for how to verify
signatures on the release.

## Script download and install

To install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems, run:

```
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

```

For beta installation, run:

```
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash -s beta

```

Note that this script checks the version of rclone installed first and
won't re-download if not needed.

## Beta releases

[Beta releases](https://beta.rclone.org) are generated from each commit
to master. Note these are named like

```
{Version Tag}.beta.{Commit Number}.{Git Commit Hash}

```

e.g.

```
v1.53.0-beta.4677.b657a2204

```

The `Version Tag` is the version that the beta release will become
when it is released. You can match the `Git Commit Hash` up with the
[git log](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commits/master). The most
recent release will have the largest `Version Tag` and `Commit Number`
and will normally be at the end of the list.

Some beta releases may have a branch name also:

```
{Version Tag}-beta.{Commit Number}.{Git Commit Hash}.{Branch Name}

```

e.g.

```
v1.53.0-beta.4677.b657a2204.semver

```

The presence of `Branch Name` indicates that this is a feature under
development which will at some point be merged into the normal betas
and then into a normal release.

The beta releases haven't been through the [full integration test
suite](https://pub.rclone.org/integration-tests/) like the releases.
However it is useful to try the latest beta before reporting an issue.

Note that [rclone.org](https://rclone.org/) is only updated on
releases - to see the documentation for the latest beta go to
[tip.rclone.org](https://tip.rclone.org/).

script) from a URL which doesn't change then you can use these links.

## Description

![@ncw](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4&size=48)[ncw](https://github.com/ncw)opened [on Nov 18, 2020](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783#issue-745607458)
# Rclone security problem - [CVE-2020-28924](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rmw5-xpg9-jr29 "CVE-2020-28924")

Passwords users have generated using `rclone config` with rclone 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to 1.53.2 (released 2020-10-26) may be insecure and should be changed.

Passwords you made up yourself are fine.

This is known as [CVE-2020-28924](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28924).

There is a tool to check your rclone config file for bad passwords here: <https://github.com/rclone/passwordcheck>

See [this forum post](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-53-3-release/20569) for additional help.

## Analysis

In this commit

[193c30d](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/193c30d57038017370594d5bc8ee9bc32580ddf2)

`random.Password` was factored out into `lib/random`.

At that time the library `crypto/rand` was accidentally replaced with `math/rand` leading to the pseudo random number generator being used instead of the crypto strong random number generator.

Consequences:

Callers of `random.Password` will have been getting a password based on `math/rand` instead of `crypto/rand` which reduces the amount of entropy for passwords enormously.

* `fs/config/config.go: Password = random.Password`
  + This is choosing random passwords for users in the config generator.
  + This is a problem since users may have used these to configure services.
* `fs/rc/rcserver/rcserver.go: randomPass, err := random.Password(128)`
  + This is choosing short lived random passwords for use with the web ui.
  + This is a minor problem since these passwords are regenerated every time rclone is run.
* `lib/oauthutil/oauthutil.go: state, err := random.Password(128)`
  + This is making some random state for the oauth callback.
  + This isn't a security problem

Rclone initialised the seed of `math/rand` in cmd/cmd.go Main with

```
rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())

```

However `time.Now().Unix()` only changes every second, meaning passwords generated only change every second. The passwords generated by `random.Password` are therefore completely determinstic based on the unix second that rclone was started.

## Consequences

Passwords users have generated using `rclone config` may be insecure. In particular if you generated a password like this with `rclone config` using rclone 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to 1.53.2 (released 2020-10-26) then it will have been selected from a limited set of passwords and should be changed.

```
Password or pass phrase for encryption.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
y/g> g
Password strength in bits.
64 is just about memorable
128 is secure
1024 is the maximum
Bits> 64 <- the number you typed in here is irrelevant
Your password is: XXXXXXXXXXXX

```

The faulty commit went into rclone at "Sun Aug 25 08:39:31 2019 +0100"

## Fixes

This issue is easily fixed with commit [7985df3](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/7985df37681f54d013816a4641da4f9b085b3aa5)

All uses of `math/rand` were reviewed in the code

An additional commit [f090549](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/f0905499e340f9e73e2552cf0c8b79cbf14ecbc4) was added to seed the random number generator with a crypto strong seed as a mitigation for any future problems.

## Demonstration of the problem

Save this bash script to a file called `test-rclone-password.sh` and make it executable.

```
#!/bin/bash
# Test the password generation of rclone
# optionally pass in a path to an rclone binary to use as the first argument

RCLONE="${1:-rclone}"

# Check the binary exists
if ! ${RCLONE} version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Rclone binary ${RCLONE} not found"
    exit 1
fi

(
    # Run through the rclone config generator creating a crypt backend
    echo "n" ; sleep .1
    echo "test" ; sleep .1
    echo "crypt" ; sleep .1
    echo "/tmp" ; sleep .1
    echo "1" ; sleep .1
    echo "1" ; sleep .1
    echo "g" ; sleep .1
    echo "64" ; sleep .1
) | ${RCLONE} config 2>&1 | grep "Your password is"
```

If you run multiple copies of it at once which start at the same second, you can see that with a vulnerable rclone all the passwords generated are the same. Pass it an rclone binary to test (or leave off to use the one on the path)

```
$ ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.53.2 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.53.2 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.53.2
Bits> Your password is: eULvaUR9A_A
Bits> Your password is: eULvaUR9A_A
Bits> Your password is: eULvaUR9A_A

```

However if this is done with a non vulnerable rclone you will get all different passwords

```
$ ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.48 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.48 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.48
Bits> Your password is: G5dODi-AoFo
Bits> Your password is: KL1QRvaRSXw
Bits> Your password is: b6sVRzjfdkg

```

# rclone: Weak random number generation — GLSA **202107-14**

rclone uses weak random number generation such that generated
passwords can be easily cracked.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/rclone** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.53.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.53.3** |

### Background

rclone is a problem to sync files to and from various cloud storage
providers.

### Description

Passwords generated with rclone were insecurely generated and are
vulnerable to brute force attacks.

### Impact

Data kept secret with a password generated by rclone may be disclosed to
a local attacker.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All rclone users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/rclone-1.53.3"

```

## Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator in Rclone

High severity

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-rmw5-xpg9-jr29/dependabot)

## Package

gomod

github.com/rclone/rclone
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.53.3

## Patched versions

1.53.3

## Description

An issue was discovered in Rclone before 1.53.3. Due to the use of a weak random number generator, the password generator has been producing weak passwords with much less entropy than advertised. The suggested passwords depend deterministically on the time the second rclone was started. This limits the entropy of the passwords enormously. These passwords are often used in the crypt backend for encryption of data. It would be possible to make a dictionary of all possible passwords with about 38 million entries per password length. This would make decryption of secret material possible with a plausible amount of effort. NOTE: all passwords generated by affected versions should be changed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Rclone security problem - [CVE-2020-28924](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rmw5-xpg9-jr29 "CVE-2020-28924")

Passwords users have generated using `rclone config` with rclone 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to 1.53.2 (released 2020-10-26) may be insecure and should be changed.

Passwords you made up yourself are fine.

This is known as [CVE-2020-28924](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28924).

There is a tool to check your rclone config file for bad passwords here: <https://github.com/rclone/passwordcheck>

See [this forum post](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-53-3-release/20569) for additional help.

[193c30d](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/193c30d57038017370594d5bc8ee9bc32580ddf2)

`random.Password` was factored out into `lib/random`.

At that time the library `crypto/rand` was accidentally replaced with `math/rand` leading to the pseudo random number generator being used instead of the crypto strong random number generator.

Consequences:

Callers of `random.Password` will have been getting a password based on `math/rand` instead of `crypto/rand` which reduces the amount of entropy for passwords enormously.

* `fs/config/config.go: Password = random.Password`
  + This is choosing random passwords for users in the config generator.
  + This is a problem since users may have used these to configure services.
* `fs/rc/rcserver/rcserver.go: randomPass, err := random.Password(128)`
  + This is choosing short lived random passwords for use with the web ui.
  + This is a minor problem since these passwords are regenerated every time rclone is run.
* `lib/oauthutil/oauthutil.go: state, err := random.Password(128)`
  + This is making some random state for the oauth callback.
  + This isn't a security problem

Rclone initialised the seed of `math/rand` in cmd/cmd.go Main with

```
rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())

```

However `time.Now().Unix()` only changes every second, meaning passwords generated only change every second. The passwords generated by `random.Password` are therefore completely determinstic based on the unix second that rclone was started.

## Consequences

Passwords users have generated using `rclone config` may be insecure. In particular if you generated a password like this with `rclone config` using rclone 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to 1.53.2 (released 2020-10-26) then it will have been selected from a limited set of passwords and should be changed.

```
Password or pass phrase for encryption.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
y/g> g
Password strength in bits.
64 is just about memorable
128 is secure
1024 is the maximum
Bits> 64 <- the number you typed in here is irrelevant
Your password is: XXXXXXXXXXXX

```

The faulty commit went into rclone at "Sun Aug 25 08:39:31 2019 +0100"

## Fixes

This issue is easily fixed with commit [7985df3](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/7985df37681f54d013816a4641da4f9b085b3aa5)

All uses of `math/rand` were reviewed in the code

An additional commit [f090549](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/f0905499e340f9e73e2552cf0c8b79cbf14ecbc4) was added to seed the random number generator with a crypto strong seed as a mitigation for any future problems.

## Demonstration of the problem

Save this bash script to a file called `test-rclone-password.sh` and make it executable.

```
#!/bin/bash
# Test the password generation of rclone
# optionally pass in a path to an rclone binary to use as the first argument

RCLONE="${1:-rclone}"

# Check the binary exists
if ! ${RCLONE} version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Rclone binary ${RCLONE} not found"
    exit 1
fi

(
    # Run through the rclone config generator creating a crypt backend
    echo "n" ; sleep .1
    echo "test" ; sleep .1
    echo "crypt" ; sleep .1
    echo "/tmp" ; sleep .1
    echo "1" ; sleep .1
    echo "1" ; sleep .1
    echo "g" ; sleep .1
    echo "64" ; sleep .1
) | ${RCLONE} config 2>&1 | grep "Your password is"
```

If you run multiple copies of it at once which start at the same second, you can see that with a vulnerable rclone all the passwords generated are the same. Pass it an rclone binary to test (or leave off to use the one on the path)

```
$ ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.53.2 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.53.2 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.53.2
Bits> Your password is: eULvaUR9A_A
Bits> Your password is: eULvaUR9A_A
Bits> Your password is: eULvaUR9A_A

```

However if this is done with a non vulnerable rclone you will get all different passwords

```
$ ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.48 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.48 & ./test-rclone-password.sh rclone-v1.48
Bits> Your password is: G5dODi-AoFo
Bits> Your password is: KL1QRvaRSXw
Bits> Your password is: b6sVRzjfdkg

```
