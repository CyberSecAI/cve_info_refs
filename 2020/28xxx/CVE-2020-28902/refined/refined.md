        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an unsanitized command line in the call to the *exec()* function within the `autodiscovery_component_update_cron()` function. The `tmpfile` argument, which is generated by concatenating a user-controlled `$id` argument, is used verbatim in the command line, allowing for shell command injection.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Unsanitized command line argument in the `exec()` function leading to shell command injection."

        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of timezone data that is being passed to a shell command. This vulnerability can be found in the `cron/cmd_subsys.php` file, specifically when handling the `COMMAND_CHANGE_TIMEZONE` command.",
