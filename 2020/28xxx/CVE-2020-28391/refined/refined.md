Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded private RSA key.
*   Specifically, SCALANCE X devices, when used with a C-PLUG, fail to generate a new unique key upon factory reset. Instead, they utilize a private RSA key that is pre-installed in the firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The devices are using a cryptographic key that is hardcoded into the firmware, making it possible to obtain the key and compromise the security of the device.
*   Failure to generate unique keys after a factory reset under certain conditions (when a C-PLUG is in use).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker can use the hardcoded private key to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Decryption of captured traffic:** By using the compromised private key, an attacker can decrypt previously captured network traffic. This may expose sensitive information sent across the network.
*   Compromise of confidentiality and integrity of communications

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack can be conducted remotely over the network.
*   **Low attack complexity:** The vulnerability is described as having low attack complexity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable device to intercept traffic and perform the man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Ability to intercept traffic:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic to decrypt it using the known private key.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory indicates that this vulnerability is present in specific versions of SCALANCE X-200 and SCALANCE X-200IRT devices. The content from cert-portal.siemens.com also indicates that this vulnerability affects SCALANCE X-200RNA devices.
*   Siemens has provided updates to address this issue.
*   Workarounds include updating the default self-signed device X.509 certificates with trusted certificates and updating hardcoded X.509 certificates from the firmware image.
