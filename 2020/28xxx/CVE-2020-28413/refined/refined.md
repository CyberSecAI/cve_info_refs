Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the "access" parameter within the `mc_project_get_users` function of the Mantis Bug Tracker SOAP API. This parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection. By manipulating the "access" parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code. The response doesn't directly reveal the results of the injected SQL, but attackers can infer results by observing the application's behavior (e.g., through boolean conditions, timing attacks, or by inducing errors).
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (hashed passwords), usernames, email addresses, and other data related to projects and users within the MantisBT system.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining user credentials, attackers could gain unauthorized access to the MantisBT system and potentially escalate privileges.
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database, depending on the database user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SOAP API:** The vulnerability is present in the SOAP API endpoint of MantisBT.
*   **Manipulating the 'access' parameter:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted SOAP request to the `mc_project_get_users` function, modifying the value of the `access` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid User Account:**  The attacker needs a valid user account within the MantisBT system. The example shows an "informer" role user is sufficient for exploitation.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SOAP requests to the vulnerable MantisBT instance.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker must have a good understanding of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is within the `project_get_all_user_rows` function, which is called by `mc_project_get_users`.
*   The injected SQL code is introduced due to how the `access` variable is used in constructing a SQL query within the function:

    ```php
    $t_global_access_clause = ' >= ' . $t_global_access_level;
    ```
    If `$t_global_access_level` (derived from the `access` parameter) is not an array, it's directly concatenated into the SQL query, leading to the vulnerability.

*   The article demonstrates:
    *   How sending an empty `access` parameter causes an SQL error, exposing the SQL query.
    *   How using `0 or 1=1` in the `access` parameter can return all users.
    *   Techniques for extracting the number of users, and cracking password hashes via blind SQL injection (by using `UNION SELECT` statements and `substring()` functions).
    *   How to use SQLMap for automated exploitation.

* The vulnerability is present in MantisBT version 2.24.3 and fixed in version 2.24.4
