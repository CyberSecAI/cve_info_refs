Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue in the `copy-props` package. This occurs due to the way the package copies properties between objects. Specifically, the package uses an unsafe recursive merge function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is that the `copy-props` package, in versions prior to 2.0.5, allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects. This is achieved by manipulating special attributes like `__proto__`.
*   **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The package uses a recursive merge function that doesn't properly handle properties named `__proto__`. When a source object contains a `__proto__` property, the merge function recurses with the prototype of `Object`, allowing the attacker to modify the base prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values (e.g., changing a function to an integer), attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions and disrupt application functionality, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates an attacker-controlled property from the polluted prototype, it can be exploited for RCE by injecting malicious code.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify properties on the prototype that the application uses for informational or security purposes (e.g., modifying `isAdmin` to `true` to gain elevated privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves providing a specially crafted JSON payload to the `copyProps` function. This payload contains the `__proto__` property, which is then used to pollute the object prototype.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by controlling the input to the `copyProps` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable `copyProps` function. This could occur if the attacker can control data that is merged by the application.
*   No special privileges or user interaction is required. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes).
*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how a malicious payload can pollute the prototype by injecting a `polluted` property.
*   The vulnerability affects both the npm package `copy-props` and the maven package `org.webjars.npm:copy-props`.
*   The fix involves upgrading the `copy-props` package to version 2.0.5 or higher.
*   The Snyk vulnerability database provides a CVSS score of 7.3 (High), while NVD provides a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
*   The Snyk analysis shows that the attack vector is "Network", meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
