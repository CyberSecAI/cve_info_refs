- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication check on requests to the medical tests endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Missing authentication: Unauthenticated users can access medical test results.
  - Insecure file upload: Allows administrative users to upload arbitrary files, including malicious ones like PHP web shells.
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS):  Stored XSS vulnerability allows users to inject malicious scripts, leading to privilege escalation.
  - Path traversal: Allows authenticated administrators to write files outside the designated directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Missing authentication**: Information disclosure of protected health information (PHI).
    - **Insecure file upload**: Arbitrary code execution on the application server, information disclosure, and potential for further network compromise.
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: Privilege escalation by creating a new admin user through a crafted payload.
    - **Path traversal**:  Ability to write files outside of designated directories, potentially leading to denial of service by filling up the disk, or to store malicious files. Note this path traversal issue was of low impact because existing files could not be overwritten.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Missing authentication**: Remote, unauthenticated access via direct requests to the `/tests/` directory.
    - **Insecure file upload**: Remote, authenticated access via the `/openclinic/medical/test_new.php` endpoint.
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: Remote, injection through input fields in the application, triggered by another user clicking a crafted link.
    - **Path traversal**: Remote, authenticated access via the `/admin/theme_new.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Missing authentication**: No special capabilities or position required, only knowledge of the file paths.
    - **Insecure file upload**: Administrative or Administrator role access.
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: Administrative or Administrator role access to inject the payload and a different user with administrative access to trigger the payload.
    - **Path traversal**: Administrator role access.
