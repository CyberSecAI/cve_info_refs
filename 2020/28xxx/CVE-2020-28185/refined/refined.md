Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-28185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an insecure implementation in the `initialise.php` script of the TerraMaster TOS web interface. Specifically, it allows for user enumeration by checking if a user account exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **User Enumeration:** The system reveals whether a given username exists in the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can identify valid usernames on the system which can be used in subsequent attacks, such as password reset.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wizard/initialise.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker can be unauthenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable TerraMaster device's web interface (on port 8181 in the example).

**Technical Details**
The following POST request can be used to enumerate user:
```
POST /wizard/initialise.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.206:8181
Content-Length: 28
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Referer: http://192.168.1.206:8181

tab=checkuser&username=testaccount
```
A successful enumeration will have a JSON response like
```
{"username":"testaccount","email":"[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)","status":1}
```
If the user does not exist, the status will not be 1.
