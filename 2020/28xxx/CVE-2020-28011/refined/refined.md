- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `queue_run()` function when processing the `-R deliver_selectstring` and `-S deliver_selectstring_sender` options.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when constructing a command string using `sprintf`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with the privileges of the "exim" user could potentially achieve full root privileges if the vulnerability is exploitable.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation through the `exim` binary using the `-R` and `-S` options with excessively long strings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires the attacker to have the privileges of the "exim" user to execute the `exim` binary with the vulnerable options.
