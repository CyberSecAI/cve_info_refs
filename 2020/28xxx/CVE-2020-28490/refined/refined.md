Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of `async-execute` which executes shell commands with user-provided input without proper sanitization. The vulnerability exists in the `async-git` package, where shell commands are constructed by concatenating user-supplied input. This leads to the possibility of command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection (CWE-78), where an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands through user-controlled input passed to git commands. The use of `exec` and construction of git commands using string concatenation without proper sanitization are the weaknesses exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable code is running by injecting shell meta-characters within the input arguments of git functions, such as `git.reset()`, gaining full control of the affected system. This can result in loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** The attacker can modify files and configurations via command injection.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality**: The attacker can access sensitive information on the system via command injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing maliciously crafted strings containing shell meta-characters as arguments to git commands handled by the vulnerable package, specifically through the `reset` function. For example, an attacker could use backticks in the `git.reset()` command argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control input:** The attacker needs the ability to control the input arguments passed to functions in the `async-git` package (e.g., the `destination` argument of the `reset` function).
*   **No Special Access Required:** The attacker doesn't require any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code uses `async-execute` to execute git commands.
* The vulnerable `reset` function in `lib/reset/index.js` uses string interpolation to create the git command with a user controlled destination, `return await exec(\`git reset \${JSON.stringify(destination)} ${hard ? '--hard' : ''}\`);` which makes it vulnerable.
* The fix replaces the usage of `async-execute` with `child_process.spawn`. The `spawn` command mitigates command injection by passing the command and arguments as an array to be executed rather than a string. This change is made in `helpers/spawn/index.js`, and used in several files, like `index.js`, `modified/index.js`, `remote/index.js`, `reset/index.js`, `tag/index.js`, `unadded/index.js`

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.13.2 of the `async-git` package.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Omri Lotan, Adar-Checkmarx.
