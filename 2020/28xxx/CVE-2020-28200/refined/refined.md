  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2020-28200",
      "root_cause": "The Sieve interpreter lacks protection against abusive scripts, particularly those using excessive regular expressions.",

        "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)"
      ],

        "Path Traversal (CWE-24)"
