Product: Dovecot
Vendor: OX Software GmbH
Internal reference: DOV-4476 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
Vulnerable version: 2.3.11-2.3.14
Vulnerable component: imap, pop3, submission, managesieve
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 2.3.14.1
Vendor notification: 2021-03-22
Solution date: 2021-04-14
Public disclosure: 2021-06-21
CVE reference: CVE-2021-29157
CVSS: 6.7 (CVSS3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
Researcher credit: Kirin of Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Vulnerability Details:

Dovecot does not correctly escape kid and azp fields in JWT tokens. This may be used to supply attacker controlled keys to validate tokens in some configurations. This requires attacker to be able to write files to local disk.

Risk:

Local attacker can login as any user and access their emails.

Workaround:

Disable local JWT validation in oauth2, or use a different dict driver than fs:posix.

Solution:

Operators should update to 2.3.14.1 or later version.

```

Subject: CVE-2020-28200: Dovecot Pigeonhole Sieve excessive resource usage

Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2021-06-28

Affected product: Dovecot IMAP Server
Vendor: OX Software GmbH

Internal reference: DOV-4159
Vulnerability type: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Vulnerable version: ancient
Vulnerable component: sieve
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fix available
Researcher credits: Innokentii Sennovskii from BI.ZONE (rumata)
Vendor notification: 2020-09-23
CVE reference: CVE-2020-28200
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

Vulnerability Details:
Sieve interpreter is not protected against abusive scripts that claim excessive resource usage.
Fixed by limiting both the CPU system+user time per single script execution and cumulatively over
several script runs within a configurable timeout period. Sufficiently large CPU time usage is
summed in the Sieve script binary and execution is blocked when the sum exceeds the limit within that time.
The block is lifted when the script is updated after the resource usage times out.

Risk:
Attacker can cause uncontrolled CPU resource consumption to cause partial or complete denial of service.

Steps to reproduce:
Use sufficiently CPU intensive regular expression.

Solution:
Install patched version of Dovecot

Workaround:
Disable sieve "regex" extension.

### Features

#### **Best performing**

Dovecot is among the **best performing** IMAP servers while still supporting the **standard** [mbox](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/config/mailbox/formats/mbox.html) and [Maildir](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/config/mailbox/formats/maildir.html) formats. The mailboxes are transparently indexed, which gives Dovecot its good performance while still providing full compatibility with existing mailbox handling tools.

#### **Flexible authentication**

Dovecot’s user authentication is extremely flexible and feature-rich, supporting many different [authentication databases](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/config/auth/passdb.html) and [mechanisms](https://doc.dovecot.org/2.3/configuration_manual/authentication/authentication_mechanisms/).

#### **Standards compliant**

Dovecot is **standards compliant**. Dovecot passes all [IMAP server standard compliancy tests](https://dovecot.github.io/imaptest/compliancy.html) while most other servers fail many of them.

#### **Postfix and Exim**

[Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) 2.3+ and [Exim](http://www.exim.org/) 4.64+ users can do SMTP authentication directly against Dovecot’s authentication backend without having to configure it separately. You can also use our submission service to perform authentication before relaying mail to your MTA.

#### **Self-optimizing**

Dovecot’s indexes are **self-optimizing.** They contain exactly what the user’s client commonly needs, no more and no less.

#### **Easy migration**

Dovecot supports easy [migration from many existing IMAP and POP3 servers](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/admin/migration.html), allowing the change to be transparent to existing users.

#### **Self-healing**

Dovecot is **self-healing.** It tries to fix most of the problems it notices by itself, such as broken index files. The problems are however logged so the administrator can later try to figure out what caused them.

#### **Workarounds support**

Dovecot supports [workarounds](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/config/guides/quick.html#client-workarounds) for several bugs in IMAP and POP3 clients. Since the workarounds may cause the protocol exchange to be sub-optimal, you can enable only the workarounds you need.

#### **Admin-friendly**

Dovecot tries to be **admin-friendly.** Common error messages are made as easily understandable as possible. Any crash, no matter how it happened, is considered a bug that will be fixed.

#### **Security**

Dovecot’s [design](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/developers/home.html) and [implementation](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/developers/coding_style.html) is highly focused on security. You can report any security vulnerabilities via our [YesWeHack program](https://vdp.open-xchange.com/) or via email to security@dovecot.org.

#### **Clustered filesystems compatibility**

Dovecot allows mailboxes and their indexes to be modified by multiple computers at the same time, while still performing well. This means that Dovecot **works well with clustered filesystems**. [NFS has caching problems](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/config/guides/nfs.html), but you can work around them with Dovecot cluster.

#### **Easily Extensible**

Dovecot is easily extensible. [Plugins](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/) can add new commands, modify existing behavior, add their own data into index files or even add support for new mailbox formats. For example [quota](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/plugins/quota.html) and [ACL support](https://doc.dovecot.org/main/core/plugins/acl.html) are completely implemented as plugins.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-891c1ab1ac
2021-07-05 01:35:53.935167
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dovecot
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 2.3.15
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <http://www.dovecot.org/>
Summary : Secure imap and pop3 server
Description :
Dovecot is an IMAP server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security
primarily in mind. It also contains a small POP3 server. It supports mail
in either of maildir or mbox formats.

The SQL drivers and authentication plug-ins are in their subpackages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

\* CVE-2021-29157: Dovecot does not correctly escape kid and azp fields in
JWT tokens. This may be used to supply attacker controlled keys to
validate tokens, if attacker has local access. \* CVE-2021-33515: On-path
attacker could have injected plaintext commands before STARTTLS
negotiation that would be executed after STARTTLS finished with the
client. \* Disconnection log messages are now more standardized across services.
They also always now start with "Disconnected" prefix. \* Dovecot now depends on
libsystemd for systemd integration. \* Removed support for Lua 5.2. Use version
5.1 or 5.3 instead. \* config: Some settings are now marked as "hidden". It's
discouraged to change these settings. They will no longer be visible in
doveconf output, except if they have been changed or if doveconf -s
parameter is used. See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/advanced/> for
details. \* imap-compress: Compression level is now algorithm specific.
See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/plugin/compress-plugin/> \* indexer-worker:
Convert "Indexed" info logs to an event named
"indexer\_worker\_indexing\_finished". See
[https://doc.dovecot.org/admin\_manual/list\_of\_events/#indexer-worker-indexing...](https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#indexer-worker-indexing-)
finished + Add TSLv1.3 support to min\_protocols. + Allow configuring
ssl\_cipher\_suites. (for TLSv1.3+) + acl: Add acl\_ignore\_namespace setting which
allows to entirely ignore ACLs for the listed namespaces. + imap:
Support official RFC8970 preview/snippet syntax. Old methods of
retrieving preview information via IMAP commands ("SNIPPET and PREVIEW
with explicit algorithm selection") have been deprecated. + imapc: Support
INDEXPVT for imapc storage to enable private message flags for cluster
wide shared mailboxes. + lib-storage: Add new events: mail\_opened,
mail\_expunge\_requested, mail\_expunged, mail\_cache\_lookup\_finished. See
<https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#mail> + zlib, imap-
compression, fs-compress: Support compression levels that the
algorithm supports. Before, we would allow hardcoded value between 1
to 9 and would default to 6. Now we allow using per-algorithm value
range and default to whatever default the algorithm specifies. - \*-login:
Commands pipelined together with and just after the authenticate
command cause these commands to be executed twice. This applies to all
protocols that involve user login, which currently comprises of imap,
pop3, submisision and managesieve. - \*-login: Processes are supposed to
disconnect the oldest non-logged in connection when process\_limit was
reached. This didn't actually happen with the default "high-security
mode" (with service\_count=1) where each connection is handled by a
separate process. - \*-login: When login process reaches client/process limits,
oldest client connections are disconnected. If one of these was still
doing anvil lookup, this caused a crash. This could happen only if the
login process limits were very low or if the server was overloaded. -
Fixed building with link time optimizations (-flto). - auth: Userdb iteration
with passwd driver does not always return all users with some nss
drivers. - dsync: Shared INBOX not synced when "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" was
disabled. If a user has a shared mailbox which is another user's INBOX,
dsync didn't include the mailbox in syncing unless explicit naming is
enabled with "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" set to "yes". - dsync: Shared
namespaces were not synced with "-n" flag. - dsync: Syncing shared INBOX failed
if mail\_attribute\_dict was not set. If a user has a shared mailbox
that is another user's INBOX, dsync failed to export the mailbox if
mail attributes are disabled. - fts-solr, fts-tika: Using both Solr FTS and Tika
may have caused HTTP requests to assert-crash: Panic: file http-
client-request.c: line 1232 (http\_client\_request\_send\_more): assertion
failed: (req->payload\_input != NULL) - fts-tika: 5xx errors returned by Tika
server as indexing failures. However, Tika can return 5xx for some
attachments every time. So the 5xx error should be retried once, but
treated as success if it happens on the retry as well. v2.3
regression. - fts-tika: v2.3.11 regression: Indexing messages with fts-tika may
have resulted in Panic: file message-parser.c: line 802
(message\_parser\_deinit\_from\_parts): assertion failed:
(ctx->nested\_parts\_count == 0 || i\_stream\_have\_bytes\_left(ctx->input)) - imap:
SETMETADATA could not be used to unset metadata values. Instead NIL
was handled as a "NIL" string. v2.3.14 regression. - imap: IMAP BINARY FETCH
crashes at least on empty base64 body: Panic: file index-mail-
binary.c: line 358 (blocks\_count\_lines): assertion failed:
(block\_count == 0 || block\_idx+1 == block\_count) - imap: If IMAP client using
the NOTIFY command was disconnected while sending FETCH notifications
to the client, imap could crash with Panic: Trying to close mailbox
INBOX with open transactions. - imap: Using IMAP COMPRESS extension can cause
IMAP connection to hang when IMAP commands are >8 kB long. - imapc: If
remote server sent BYE but didn't immediately disconnect, it could
cause infinite busy-loop. - lib-index: Corrupted cache record size in
dovecot.index.cache file could have caused a crash (segfault) when
accessing it. - lib-oauth2: JWT token time validation now works correctly with
32-bit systems. - lib-ssl-iostream: Checking hostnames against an SSL
certificate was case-sensitive. - lib-storage: Corrupted mime.parts in
dovecot.index.cache may have resulted in Panic: file imap-
bodystructure.c: line 206 (part\_write\_body): assertion failed: (text
== ((part->flags & MESSAGE\_PART\_FLAG\_TEXT) != 0)) - lib-storage: Index
rebuilding (e.g. via doveadm force-resync) didn't preserve the "hdr-
pop3-uidl" header. Because of this, the next pop3 session could have
accessed all of the emails' metadata to read their POP3 UIDL (opening
dbox files). - listescape: When using the listescape plugin and a shared
namespace the plugin didn't work properly anymore resulting in errors
like: "Invalid mailbox name: Name must not have '/' character." -
lmtp: Connection crashes if connection gets disconnected due to
multiple bad commands and the last bad command is BDAT. - lmtp: The Dovecot-
specific LMTP parameter XRCPTFORWARD was blindly forwarded by LMTP
proxy without checking that the backend has support. This caused a
command parameter error from the backend if it was running an older
Dovecot release. This could only occur in more complex setups where
the message was proxied twice; when the proxy generated the
XRCPTFORWARD parameter itself the problem did not occur, so this only
happened when it was forwarded. - lmtp: The LMTP proxy crashes with a panic when
the remote server replies with an error while the mail is still being
forwarded through a DATA/BDAT command. - lmtp: Username may have been
missing from lmtp log line prefixes when it was performing
autoexpunging. - master: Dovecot would incorrectly fail with haproxy 2.0.14
service checks. - master: Systemd service: Dovecot announces readiness
for accepting connections earlier than it should. The following
environment variables are now imported automatically and can be
omitted from import\_environment setting: NOTIFY\_SOCKET LISTEN\_FDS
LISTEN\_PID. - master: service { process\_min\_avail } was launching processes too
slowly when master was forking a lot of processes. - util: Make the health-
check.sh example script POSIX shell compatible.

# Security

#### Dovecot was designed since the beginning with security in mind and with many ways to provide privilege separation. Although the code is written with C, it’s a little bit special C variant that makes it much more difficult to write security holes accidentally than with most other C-based projects.

#### Please see <https://www.dovecot.org/bugreport-mail> for more information how to report bugs.

Below is the list of all security holes found from Dovecot. Note that most of these are quite minor holes.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-208340a217
2021-07-05 01:32:59.844887
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dovecot
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 2.3.15
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://www.dovecot.org/>
Summary : Secure imap and pop3 server
Description :
Dovecot is an IMAP server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security
primarily in mind. It also contains a small POP3 server. It supports mail
in either of maildir or mbox formats.

The SQL drivers and authentication plug-ins are in their subpackages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

\* CVE-2021-29157: Dovecot does not correctly escape kid and azp fields in
JWT tokens. This may be used to supply attacker controlled keys to
validate tokens, if attacker has local access. \* CVE-2021-33515: On-path
attacker could have injected plaintext commands before STARTTLS
negotiation that would be executed after STARTTLS finished with the
client. \* Disconnection log messages are now more standardized across services.
They also always now start with "Disconnected" prefix. \* Dovecot now depends on
libsystemd for systemd integration. \* Removed support for Lua 5.2. Use version
5.1 or 5.3 instead. \* config: Some settings are now marked as "hidden". It's
discouraged to change these settings. They will no longer be visible in
doveconf output, except if they have been changed or if doveconf -s
parameter is used. See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/advanced/> for
details. \* imap-compress: Compression level is now algorithm specific.
See <https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/plugin/compress-plugin/> \* indexer-worker:
Convert "Indexed" info logs to an event named
"indexer\_worker\_indexing\_finished". See
[https://doc.dovecot.org/admin\_manual/list\_of\_events/#indexer-worker-indexing...](https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#indexer-worker-indexing-)
finished + Add TSLv1.3 support to min\_protocols. + Allow configuring
ssl\_cipher\_suites. (for TLSv1.3+) + acl: Add acl\_ignore\_namespace setting which
allows to entirely ignore ACLs for the listed namespaces. + imap:
Support official RFC8970 preview/snippet syntax. Old methods of
retrieving preview information via IMAP commands ("SNIPPET and PREVIEW
with explicit algorithm selection") have been deprecated. + imapc: Support
INDEXPVT for imapc storage to enable private message flags for cluster
wide shared mailboxes. + lib-storage: Add new events: mail\_opened,
mail\_expunge\_requested, mail\_expunged, mail\_cache\_lookup\_finished. See
<https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#mail> + zlib, imap-
compression, fs-compress: Support compression levels that the
algorithm supports. Before, we would allow hardcoded value between 1
to 9 and would default to 6. Now we allow using per-algorithm value
range and default to whatever default the algorithm specifies. - \*-login:
Commands pipelined together with and just after the authenticate
command cause these commands to be executed twice. This applies to all
protocols that involve user login, which currently comprises of imap,
pop3, submisision and managesieve. - \*-login: Processes are supposed to
disconnect the oldest non-logged in connection when process\_limit was
reached. This didn't actually happen with the default "high-security
mode" (with service\_count=1) where each connection is handled by a
separate process. - \*-login: When login process reaches client/process limits,
oldest client connections are disconnected. If one of these was still
doing anvil lookup, this caused a crash. This could happen only if the
login process limits were very low or if the server was overloaded. -
Fixed building with link time optimizations (-flto). - auth: Userdb iteration
with passwd driver does not always return all users with some nss
drivers. - dsync: Shared INBOX not synced when "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" was
disabled. If a user has a shared mailbox which is another user's INBOX,
dsync didn't include the mailbox in syncing unless explicit naming is
enabled with "mail\_shared\_explicit\_inbox" set to "yes". - dsync: Shared
namespaces were not synced with "-n" flag. - dsync: Syncing shared INBOX failed
if mail\_attribute\_dict was not set. If a user has a shared mailbox
that is another user's INBOX, dsync failed to export the mailbox if
mail attributes are disabled. - fts-solr, fts-tika: Using both Solr FTS and Tika
may have caused HTTP requests to assert-crash: Panic: file http-
client-request.c: line 1232 (http\_client\_request\_send\_more): assertion
failed: (req->payload\_input != NULL) - fts-tika: 5xx errors returned by Tika
server as indexing failures. However, Tika can return 5xx for some
attachments every time. So the 5xx error should be retried once, but
treated as success if it happens on the retry as well. v2.3
regression. - fts-tika: v2.3.11 regression: Indexing messages with fts-tika may
have resulted in Panic: file message-parser.c: line 802
(message\_parser\_deinit\_from\_parts): assertion failed:
(ctx->nested\_parts\_count == 0 || i\_stream\_have\_bytes\_left(ctx->input)) - imap:
SETMETADATA could not be used to unset metadata values. Instead NIL
was handled as a "NIL" string. v2.3.14 regression. - imap: IMAP BINARY FETCH
crashes at least on empty base64 body: Panic: file index-mail-
binary.c: line 358 (blocks\_count\_lines): assertion failed:
(block\_count == 0 || block\_idx+1 == block\_count) - imap: If IMAP client using
the NOTIFY command was disconnected while sending FETCH notifications
to the client, imap could crash with Panic: Trying to close mailbox
INBOX with open transactions. - imap: Using IMAP COMPRESS extension can cause
IMAP connection to hang when IMAP commands are >8 kB long. - imapc: If
remote server sent BYE but didn't immediately disconnect, it could
cause infinite busy-loop. - lib-index: Corrupted cache record size in
dovecot.index.cache file could have caused a crash (segfault) when
accessing it. - lib-oauth2: JWT token time validation now works correctly with
32-bit systems. - lib-ssl-iostream: Checking hostnames against an SSL
certificate was case-sensitive. - lib-storage: Corrupted mime.parts in
dovecot.index.cache may have resulted in Panic: file imap-
bodystructure.c: line 206 (part\_write\_body): assertion failed: (text
== ((part->flags & MESSAGE\_PART\_FLAG\_TEXT) != 0)) - lib-storage: Index
rebuilding (e.g. via doveadm force-resync) didn't preserve the "hdr-
pop3-uidl" header. Because of this, the next pop3 session could have
accessed all of the emails' metadata to read their POP3 UIDL (opening
dbox files). - listescape: When using the listescape plugin and a shared
namespace the plugin didn't work properly anymore resulting in errors
like: "Invalid mailbox name: Name must not have '/' character." -
lmtp: Connection crashes if connection gets disconnected due to
multiple bad commands and the last bad command is BDAT. - lmtp: The Dovecot-
specific LMTP parameter XRCPTFORWARD was blindly forwarded by LMTP
proxy without checking that the backend has support. This caused a
command parameter error from the backend if it was running an older
Dovecot release. This could only occur in more complex setups where
the message was proxied twice; when the proxy generated the
XRCPTFORWARD parameter itself the problem did not occur, so this only
happened when it was forwarded. - lmtp: The LMTP proxy crashes with a panic when
the remote server replies with an error while the mail is still being
forwarded through a DATA/BDAT command. - lmtp: Username may have been
missing from lmtp log line prefixes when it was performing
autoexpunging. - master: Dovecot would incorrectly fail with haproxy 2.0.14
service checks. - master: Systemd service: Dovecot announces readiness
for accepting connections earlier than it should. The following
environment variables are now imported automatically and can be
omitted from import\_environment setting: NOTIFY\_SOCKET LISTEN\_FDS
LISTEN\_PID. - master: service { process\_min\_avail } was launching processes too
slowly when master was forking a lot of processes. - util: Make the health-
check.sh example script POSIX shell compatible.
