What is SpeedFan
![SpeedFan](images/speedfan_100.jpg)
SpeedFan is a program that monitors ***voltages***, ***fan speeds*** and ***temperatures***
in computers with hardware monitor chips. SpeedFan can even access ***S.M.A.R.T.*** info and show
***hard disk temperatures***. SpeedFan supports ***SCSI*** disks too.
SpeedFan can even change the FSB on some hardware (but this should be considered a bonus feature).
SpeedFan can access [digital temperature sensors](forumsensors.php) and can ***change fan speeds***
accordingly, thus reducing noise.
SpeedFan works fine with Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, Windows 7, 2008, Windows 8, **Windows 10** and
**Windows Server 2012**. It works with Windows 64 bit too.

![temperatures](images/motherboard_100.jpg)
SpeedFan can access the temperature sensors available on your motherboard and on your nVidia video
card. The most widely available temperatures are from the chipset, the CPU, the ambient and from
the power circuitry.

![cpu temperatures](images/cpu_100.jpg)
Modern CPUs can report their own internal temperature. Multi-core CPUs are often able to report
temperatures from each single core. SpeedFan can access those readings and report changes.

![fans](images/fan_100.jpg)
More powerful hardware (motherboards, CPUs, video cards and hard disks) often requires more power.
More power leads to more heat to dissipate. A proper airflow inside the computer cabinet helps to
keep temperatures low. Inside computers there are fans that create such an airflow. SpeedFan can
report the speeds of each fan and it can even change their speed based on current temperatures.
This lowers noise and improves computer experience.

![voltages](images/psu2_100.jpg)
SpeedFan can access the voltages reported by the hardware. This can help to identify odd issues
with computers resetting under stress, for example. Please, note that SpeedFan reports the voltages
according to the official documentation. Sometimes hardware manufacturers use custom circuitry. In
the FAQ you can find further info on this topic.

![SMART](images/harddisk_100.jpg)
Almost every hard disk can report a set of data about its own health and status. This is called
S.M.A.R.T.. Based on reported data, a hard disk failure can often be early detected. Hard disk
temperature can be read too and it is useful to identify overheating components that could reduce
your valuable data reliability. SpeedFan offers a unique feature (called "In-depth online analysis")
that compares your hard disk SMART data to a model derived from millions of reports. This helps to
better identify when a specific hard disk is outside "normal" values.

![SCSI](images/scsi2u_100.jpg)
SpeedFan can report health data and statistical values returned by SCSI hard disks. Such data
contains the hard disk temperature too. Hard disk temperatures are positively correlated to hard disk
failures. This is the reason why these information are so important.

![RAID](images/raid_100.jpg)
SMART data from hard disks connected to RAID (software or hardware) controllers is more difficult to
be read. SpeedFan is improving RAID support and it currently properly supports software RAID (offered
by Windows), ARECA, CSMI and AMCC 3ware controllers. Reliable access to RAID controllers requires
support from hardware manufacturers. This is something that is being worked on.

| ***SpeedFan 4.52 Final is online!*** |  | SpeedFan 4.52 Final is now online! It adds support for **a lot of new hardware**. Bug fixes and more, as always. This version took quite a long time to see the light because of many things that happened. New versions will now appear more often. Stay tuned :-)Both the installer and the executable are digitally signed with my company's (SOKNO S.R.L.) certificate. **If you download an installer that has not SOKNO's signature, then it is not SpeedFan!** ...Enjoy! |

How fan speed changing works
SpeedFan monitor temperatures from several sources. By properly configuring SpeedFan, you can
let it change fan speeds based on system temperatures. When choosing parameters for the minimum
and maximum fan speed, try to set them by hand (disable all the VARIATE FANs checkboxes) and
listen to the noise. When you hear no noise from the fan then you can set that value as the
minimum fan speed for that fan. I suggest to use 100 as the maximum value, unless you hear a
lot of noise from it, in which case you might reduce the maximum speed to 95 or 90. You can
set, say, 60 as the maximum value and, sometimes, I myself set it that way. Consider that when
the WARNING temperature is reached, the program sets the fan speed to 100, whatever maximum
speed you selected. One last word should be said regarding the USE FAN x listbox. In my pc,
more than one temperature changes when a fan runs faster. You can configure on which fan every
temperature should rely. On my system, TEMP1 and TEMP3 are both influenced by FAN1.

A few numbers...
SpeedFan can handle:

* almost any number of South Bridges
* almost any number of hardware monitor chips
* almost any number of hard disks
* almost any number of temperature readings
* almost any number of voltage readings
* almost any number of fan speed readings
* almost any number of PWMs

Disclaimer

This program is aimed at the power user. At those who know what they're doing. I've known of no
real problem caused by SpeedFan, but may be it's due to the fact that once it made the PC
explode and the user disappeared in the blast, thus being unable to report :-) Anyway: SpeedFan
can be extremely useful, but you should first watch its behavior before setting and forgetting it.

Feedback
You can contact me at alfredo [at] almico.com if you've got
any question or suggestion or discover any strange behavior. I'd appreciate an e-mail from those
of you who try and find useful my program. Just a line of text will do.

Thanx for your attention.
