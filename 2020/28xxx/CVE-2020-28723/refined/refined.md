Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-28723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `pparam::IPParam::split` function and subsequently used in `pparam::IPv6Param::setAddress` within the `libpparam` library.
- The `split` function allocates memory using `new[]` for the `sparts` variable but doesn't deallocate it with `delete[]`, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary issue is a memory leak due to the failure to free allocated memory in the `split` function. Specifically, the allocated memory for `sparts` is not deallocated after usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated calls to the vulnerable code path could lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing the application to crash or become unstable.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** In a sustained attack, the memory leak can render the application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a specifically crafted IPv6 string to the `IPv6Param::setAddress` function. This input is passed to `split` function, allocating memory which is never freed.
- **Fuzzing:** The provided information states that the vulnerability was discovered using fuzzing techniques, where the fuzzer generates a large number of inputs, triggering the memory leak, and exposing it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker must be able to provide a string, which gets processed by `IPv6Param::setAddress`, to trigger the memory leak. 
- **Repeated Execution:** The attacker needs to repeat the attack enough times to cause an impact due to cumulative memory consumption.
- **No specific privileges are mentioned.**

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `PParam/src/sparam.cpp` file.
- The `IPv6Param::setAddress` function is responsible for parsing and validating the IPv6 string, calling the vulnerable `split` function.
- The provided code snippets and crash logs include the call stack from the fuzzer which leads to memory leak, highlighting the exact location of the vulnerability.
- The issue was reported by user `raminfp` on GitHub.
