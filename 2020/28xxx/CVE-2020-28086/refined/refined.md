The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities in the `pass` password manager, but **does not relate to CVE-2020-28086.** It describes issues related to GPG compression revealing password entropy and the lack of signing in the password store, allowing attackers to tamper with encrypted passwords.

Specifically, the content details:

*   **GPG Compression revealing entropy:** The use of GPG compression might expose information about the password's entropy, addressed by commit 51f9b6888.
*   **Lack of signing allows tampering:** The absence of signing in `pass` allows attackers to replace, rename or delete encrypted passwords. The suggested solution is to use git-commit's "gpg-sign" option with hooks for verification for tamper-proof password stores.

The information does not correlate with the description of CVE-2020-28086, which is a placeholder.

Therefore, the answer is:
