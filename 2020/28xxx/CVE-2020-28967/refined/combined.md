Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official FlashGet v1.9.6 software.
The bufer overflow allows to overwrite registers of the process to compromise the file-system by
elevates local process privileges.
The buffer overflow is located in the `current directory path` function affecting the buffer size.
Remote attackers with access to the software are able to overflow after login to compromise the
local file-system or process registers.
Exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability requires a low privilege or restricted system
user/guest account without user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results
in overwrite of the active registers to compromise of the file-system or local software process.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] current directory path
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote buffer overflow software vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with local low privileged user accounts or guest without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the remote buffer overflow vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
