- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `current directory path` function of FlashGet v1.9.6 due to insufficient buffer size allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow allows overwriting process registers and potentially compromising the file system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to file-system compromise by elevating local process privileges. Attackers can overwrite active registers leading to potential local software process compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers with access to the software, specifically through the FTP protocol, can trigger the overflow after login.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable software using the FTP protocol. A low privilege or guest user account is sufficient, and no user interaction is required.
