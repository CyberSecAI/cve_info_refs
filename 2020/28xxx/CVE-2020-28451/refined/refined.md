Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `execSync` and `execFileSync` to execute shell commands in the `image-tiler` package. The arguments passed to these functions are not properly sanitized, allowing for command injection. Specifically, the filename parameter within the image tiling command is constructed using user-controlled data and directly passed into the `convert` command, part of the ImageMagick package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core issue is the direct execution of shell commands with unsanitized input. The `convert` command which is executed as part of the image manipulation process, is vulnerable to injection of shell commands through the `patternedFilename` variable.
*   **Unsafe Use of `execSync` and `execFileSync`:** The use of these functions without proper input validation is the primary mechanism that allows for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by controlling the input parameters, which can then execute on the server/machine running the vulnerable code.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  Successful command injection can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**  The CVSS scores (9.8 critical) indicate a high impact on all three areas due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Input Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts malicious input strings for the `inPath`, `outPath`, and `pattern` parameters of the `tile` function. These inputs are used in the construction of the `convert` command passed to `execSync` or `execFileSync`, without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control input:** The attacker must be able to supply the input parameters for the image tiling process. This might be achieved via a web API, command-line interface, or through another means that passes user data to the vulnerable function.
*  **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication or privileges on the target system.

**Technical Details**

* The vulnerable code constructs the command string dynamically using string concatenation:
    ```javascript
    var command = 'convert ' + inPath +
        ' -crop ' + tileSize + 'x' + tileSize +
        ' -set filename:tile "' + patternedFilename + '"' +
        ' -quality ' + quality + ' +repage +adjoin' +
        ' "' + outPath + '/%[filename:tile]' + dotExtension + '"' ;
    execSync(command);
    ```
*   The fix involved switching to use an array for arguments to the underlying `execFileSync` and avoiding the use of `execSync`
    ```javascript
    var args = [inPath,
        '-crop', tileSize + 'x' + tileSize,
        '-set', 'filename:tile', patternedFilename,
        '-quality', quality, '+repage', '+adjoin',
        outPath + '/%[filename:tile]' + dotExtension];
    execFileSync('convert', args);
    ```
*   The Proof of Concept code provided by Snyk clearly shows how a malicious actor can inject commands:
    ```javascript
    var tile = require("image-tiler").tile;
    var tilePromise = tile("& touch 1112","& touch 222","& touch 33",{invertZoom:true});
    ```

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided Snyk information indicates that a proof-of-concept exploit is available.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of `image-tiler` prior to 2.0.2.
*   Snyk assigned the ID `SNYK-JS-IMAGETILER-1051029` to track this vulnerability.
