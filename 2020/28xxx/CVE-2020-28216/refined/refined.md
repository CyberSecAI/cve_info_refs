Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of encryption for sensitive data transmitted over the HTTP protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311): The product fails to encrypt data transmitted via HTTP, leaving it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept and read sensitive information transmitted over the network using the HTTP protocol.
- This can lead to a compromise of confidentiality.
- The severity is marked with a CVSS v3 base score of 7.6.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is physical (AV:P), meaning the attacker needs to have some form of physical access to the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have physical access to the network where the vulnerable device is operating. This could involve being on the same LAN as the device or having physical access to the network infrastructure.

**Additional Details**
The content provides a CVSS v3 vector string of AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H indicating:
-   Attack Vector: Physical
-   Attack Complexity: Low
-   Privileges Required: None
-   User Interaction: None
-   Scope: Changed
-   Confidentiality Impact: High
-   Integrity Impact: High
-   Availability Impact: High

This indicates that while physical access is needed, exploitation can be performed with low complexity and no user interaction, and can result in high impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
