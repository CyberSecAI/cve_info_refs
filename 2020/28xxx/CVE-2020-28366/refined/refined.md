    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Go programming language's `cmd/go` and `cmd/cgo` tools, where arbitrary code execution is possible at build time due to malicious symbol names in linked object files. Specifically, a hand-edited object file with an unquoted symbol name containing newline and other invalid characters can inject Go code into a cgo-generated file. This injected code could include a `//go:cgo_ldflag` pragma, leading the C linker to execute arbitrary code during package building. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2020-28366.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a failure to properly sanitize symbol names in linked object files when using cgo. Specifically, the `cgo` tool does not quote symbol names, which may contain newline characters or look like a Go comment.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Code injection vulnerability: Malicious symbol names in linked object files can inject arbitrary Go code into cgo-generated files.",
        "Unsanitized input: Symbol names are not checked for invalid characters or sequences that could be interpreted as code."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution at build time. This can occur when building a malicious package or any other code that uses cgo with untrusted input.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves using a crafted object file containing a malicious, unquoted symbol name that injects a `//go:cgo_ldflag` pragma into the generated code. This forces the C linker to run arbitrary code during the building of a package.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious package or manipulate a linked object file. This can occur if the user runs `go get` on a malicious package or uses a hand-edited object file."
