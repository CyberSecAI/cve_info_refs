{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `dset` npm module's `export()` function lacks proper validation for object properties before assignment, allowing an attacker to manipulate the prototype chain by injecting the `__proto__` property.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution",
      "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve remote code execution by creating new properties or manipulating existing ones on the prototype chain.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious input to the `keys` argument of the `export()` function, specifically including `__proto__`, an attacker can modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the vulnerable `dset` function. No special privileges are required."
  },
  "affected_environments": [
    "Versions 1.0.0 through 2.0.1 of the `dset` npm module"
  ],
  "remediation": [
    "Freezing objects to prevent modification.",
    "Validating JSON input with schema validation.",
    "Changing objects to avoid prototype association using `Object.create`."
  ],
  "poc_code": "```\nconst dset = require('dset');\nvar obj = {}\nconsole.log(\"Before : \" + obj.isAdmin);\ndset(obj, '__proto__.polluted', true);\nconsole.log(\"After : \" + obj.polluted);\n```"
