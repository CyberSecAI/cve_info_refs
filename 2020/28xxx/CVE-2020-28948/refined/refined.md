{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames within the Archive_Tar library, allowing manipulation via crafted tar archives.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper filename sanitization",
      "Lack of stream wrapper checks",
        "Bypass of phar:// checks through case manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could achieve remote code execution through Phar unserialization or overwrite arbitrary local files by manipulating filenames in a crafted tar archive. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data loss or unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted tar archive with malicious filename such as `phar://malicious_file.phar` or `file://path/to/file/to/be/overwritten`"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to upload crafted tar archives to a vulnerable system. If the PHP process is running under a privileged user, this would allow an attacker to even overwrite files like `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects multiple products that use the PEAR Archive_Tar library, including Drupal and php-pear, and has been identified through CVE-2020-28948 and CVE-2020-28949."
