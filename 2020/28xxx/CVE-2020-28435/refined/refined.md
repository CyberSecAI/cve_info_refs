Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the `ffmpeg-sdk` npm package. Specifically, the `execute` function in `index.js` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application directly passes user-controlled input to a shell command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is severe. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable application is running, potentially leading to:
    - Full compromise of the server
    - Data theft or modification
    - Denial of service
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network. As stated in the CVSS score, the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, and the possible attackers can extend to the entire internet.
- Specifically, an attacker can inject malicious commands through the `execute` function of the `ffmpeg-sdk` package by controlling user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs to be able to interact with the application that uses the vulnerable `ffmpeg-sdk` package.

**Additional Details:**
- The Snyk vulnerability report provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
- There is no fixed version for `ffmpeg-sdk`.
- The Snyk CVSS score is 9.4 (Critical), while the NVD CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical), both indicating a high severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).
- The vulnerability was published and disclosed on January 26, 2021.
