  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-28367",
    "description": "The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when cgo is in use. This may occur when running go get on a malicious package, or any other command that builds untrusted code. This can be caused by malicious gcc flags specified via a cgo directive.",
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of cgo flags allows for the injection of malicious gcc flags via a #cgo directive.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-94",
      "CWE-88"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution at build time on the developer's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious packages downloaded via `go get`",
      "Building untrusted code that uses `cgo` with malicious flags"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to inject malicious `#cgo` directives or control over linked object files that contain malicious symbols, usually within a Go package to be built.",
