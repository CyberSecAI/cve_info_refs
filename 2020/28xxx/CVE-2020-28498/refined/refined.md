Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28498:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `secp256k1` implementation within the `elliptic` library's `elliptic/ec/key.js` file. Specifically, the `derive` function, used for ECDH key exchange, does not validate that the provided public key point actually exists on the `secp256k1` curve.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of Public Key Validation:** The core issue is the missing check to ensure the validity of the public key before using it in the key derivation process.
- **Cryptographic Issue:** This missing validation allows for a "twist attack," which can compromise the security of the ECDH key exchange.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Private Key Exposure:** An attacker can potentially reveal the private key of a participant in the ECDH operation by providing an invalid public key. This can be achieved over multiple occurrences of the ECDH operation.
- **Confidentiality Loss:** The attacker gains access to the shared secret, compromising the confidentiality of the data exchanged using this derived secret.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable because the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack. This means an attacker can exploit the vulnerability via network communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Send Crafted Public Keys:** An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted invalid public key to the vulnerable system or application.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior access or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be executed without any interaction from the user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the `secp256k1` curve implementation.
- The vulnerability is fixed by adding a validation check on the public key before performing the key derivation in the `derive` function
- The fix was introduced in version 6.5.4 of the `elliptic` library.
- The vulnerability is also tracked as SNYK-JS-ELLIPTIC-1064899 and SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1069836 by Snyk.
- The fix was introduced with commit 441b7428b0e8f6636c42118ad2aaa186d3c34c3f
