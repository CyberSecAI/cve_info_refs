{
  "CVE-2020-28009": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the gstring structure's size field within the get_stdinput() function when reading lines from stdin, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap buffer overflow",
       "Incorrect memory management"
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows an unprivileged local attacker to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution as root.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing specially crafted input to the Exim binary via stdin with a large number of continuation lines.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the Exim binary with control over the standard input."
  }
