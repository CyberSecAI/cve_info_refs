Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the SPIP web publishing engine. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize user-supplied data related to display preferences (`couleur`, `display`, `display_navigation`, `display_outils`, `imessage`, and `spip_ecran`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data, particularly within the `ecrire/inc/commencer_page.php` and `ecrire/inc/utils.php` files where display preferences and CSS classes are handled.
*   **Code Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious code through these input parameters. This happens because unsanitized input is used to construct CSS class names or other dynamically generated content, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The parameters specifically identified are `couleur`, `display`, `display_navigation`, `display_outils`, `imessage`, and `spip_ecran`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could give attackers the ability to compromise the entire system, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated Users:** The vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated users, meaning an attacker needs valid credentials to exploit it.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending malicious requests to the server, containing crafted values for vulnerable parameters. These parameters can be modified through the user interface via preference settings, or by directly manipulating the relevant HTTP requests.
*   **Exploiting User Preferences:** The injected code can be stored in the user's preference settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must have valid login credentials for a SPIP instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know which parameters are vulnerable to injection.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate and send HTTP requests with the malicious parameters.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   **Fix Information:** The Debian Security Advisories (DSAs and DLAs) state that the vulnerability is fixed in `spip` versions `3.2.4-1+deb10u3` for Debian 10 (buster) and `3.1.4-4~deb9u4` for Debian 9 (stretch) LTS.
*   **Sanitization Efforts:** The commit logs from the SPIP git repository indicate that some sanitization was introduced in the form of `spip_sanitize_classname` function and some other sanitization functions. This function is designed to clean up a string for use as CSS class names and is now being used on a few user-controlled inputs.
*   **Vulnerable Code Locations:** Code changes specifically involve `ecrire/inc/commencer_page.php` (where the class is sanitized before being used) `ecrire/inc/utils.php`, `ecrire/inc/filtres.php` and `ecrire/index.php`.
*   **Commit Information:** The commit `ae4267eb` on June 5, 2020, is one of the fixes related to this vulnerability. It specifically mentions "n'enregistrer que les preferences licites" which translates to "only save legitimate preferences". This commit is related to saving only legitimate CSS classes, instead of user-supplied, unsanitized ones.
