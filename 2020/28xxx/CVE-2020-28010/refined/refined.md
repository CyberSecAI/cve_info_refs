{
  "CVE-2020-28010": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a heap out-of-bounds write in the main() function of Exim. When Exim copies the current working directory (initial_cwd) into the heap-based big_buffer, the length of initial_cwd is not checked against the size of big_buffer before copying. Although strncpy() at line 3952 can not overflow big_buffer, initial_cwd (on Linux) can be much larger than big_buffer_size, the subsequent increment of 'p' at line 3953 can cause p to point outside of big_buffer, and subsequent writes to *p can occur out-of-bounds.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged local attacker can cause a segmentation fault, and if exploitable, obtain full root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "By creating a deeply nested directory structure and executing exim with debug options, an attacker can cause the initial_cwd variable to be large, leading to the out-of-bounds write.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user."
