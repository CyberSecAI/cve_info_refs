KL-001-2020-006 : Barco wePresent Authentication Bypass
Title: Barco wePresent Authentication Bypass
Advisory ID: KL-001-2020-006
Publication Date: 2020.11.20
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-006.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: Barco
Affected Product: wePresent WiPG-1600W
Affected Version: 2.5.1.8
Platform: Embedded Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
CVE ID: CVE-2020-28333
2. Vulnerability Description
The Barco wePresent web interface does not use session cookies
for tracking authenticated sessions. Instead, the web interface
uses a "SEID" token that is appended to the end of URLs in GET
requests. Thus the "SEID" would be exposed in web proxy logs
and browser history. An attacker that is able to capture the
"SEID" and originate requests from the same IP address (via
a NAT device or web proxy) would be able to access the user
interface of the device without having to know the credentials.
3. Technical Description
In order to make configuration changes to the Barco wePresent
WiPG-1600W, a "random" value sent to the web interface client
from the device is required to be provided -- the "SEID". It
seems to be acting like a Session ID in a cookie. However,
the "SEID" is passed as a parameter in URLs and in the body
of POSTs. Since it is passed as a parameter in the URL, it
can be logged by web proxies or browser history. An example is:
https://192.168.2.200/cgi-bin/web\_index.cgi?lang=en&src=AwSystem.html&ertqVvnKV4TjU9Vt
Where "ertqVvnKV4TjU9Vt" is the SEID. No session cookie exists,
just this value passed on the URL as a parameter, and in the
body of POSTs to make configuration changes. This SEID is all
that is required to access pages behind authentication or to
make configuration changes via POSTs. There is no Authorization
header passed in the HTTP requests.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
The vendor has released an updated firmware (2.5.3.12) which
remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
notes are available at:
