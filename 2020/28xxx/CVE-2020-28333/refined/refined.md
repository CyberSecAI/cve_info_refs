- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface uses a "SEID" token passed as a parameter in URLs instead of session cookies for tracking authenticated sessions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Authentication Bypass:  An attacker can bypass authentication by capturing a valid "SEID" token.
    - Exposure of Sensitive Information: The "SEID" token is exposed in web proxy logs and browser history due to being included in URLs.
    - Lack of proper session management: The absence of session cookies and reliance on URL parameters for session tracking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who can obtain a valid "SEID" token and originate requests from the same IP address can access the device's user interface and make configuration changes without knowing the credentials.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Capturing the "SEID" token from web proxy logs or browser history.
    - Originating requests from the same IP address as the user whose "SEID" was captured (e.g. via NAT or web proxy).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to capture a valid "SEID" token.
    - The attacker must be able to send requests from the same IP address (or appear as such using a web proxy or NAT) as the legitimate user whose SEID was captured.
