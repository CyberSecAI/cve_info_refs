Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-28242:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Asterisk handles outbound INVITE challenges where the nonce changes in each response. Specifically, Asterisk does not properly terminate the INVITE transaction when faced with continuously changing nonces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Infinite Loop:** Asterisk enters an infinite loop of sending INVITE requests when it receives challenges with different nonces on each response.
- **Lack of Transaction Termination:** The transaction does not terminate, even if the call is hung up by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Exhaustion:** The continuous INVITE loop causes Asterisk to consume increasing amounts of memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory exhaustion leads to a restart or shutdown of the Asterisk server, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Outbound INVITE:** The attack is triggered by an outbound INVITE request.
- **Authentication Challenge:** The attacker needs to send authentication challenges in response to the outbound INVITE, and ensure a different nonce in every challenge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Position:** The attacker can be a remote entity
- **Control over Authentication Server:** The attacker needs to have control over the authentication server to send authentication challenges and control the nonce.
- **Outbound Authentication:** The target endpoint in Asterisk must be configured to perform outbound authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Asterisk, including 13.x, 16.x, 17.x, 18.x, and Certified Asterisk 16.8.
- The issue is fixed by adding a counter to stop sending INVITEs after reaching a limit.
- Patches were created to fix this vulnerability, and were included in Asterisk versions 13.37.1, 16.14.1, 17.8.1, 18.0.1, and Certified Asterisk 16.8-cert5.
