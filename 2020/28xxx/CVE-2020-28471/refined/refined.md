Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28471:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `properties-reader` library's improper handling of the `__proto__` property when parsing properties files. Specifically, the library doesn't prevent the use of `__proto__` as a section name, which allows an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is prototype pollution. By injecting a property named `__proto__` in a properties file, an attacker can add or modify properties on the `Object.prototype`. This affects all JavaScript objects, leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Unsafe Property Definition:** The library uses a vulnerable method of property definition by path, where an attacker-controlled "path" can set a value on `__proto__`, leading to prototype pollution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying critical prototype properties (like `toString`), attackers can trigger JavaScript errors and cause DoS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the code evaluates object attributes, an attacker could potentially inject and execute malicious code by polluting prototypes.
- **Property Injection:** An attacker could inject properties that alter the codebase's logic by polluting the prototype. Examples include setting admin privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via a crafted properties file that contains `__proto__` as a section name. This file is then parsed by the vulnerable `properties-reader` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to control the properties file that is processed by the application using `properties-reader`. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Providing a malicious properties file directly to the application.
    - Manipulating the source of properties files that the application loads.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how the prototype pollution can be achieved: a `payload.properties` file sets a `polluted` property on `__proto__`, which then becomes available on all objects.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `properties-reader` prior to 2.2.0.
- The fix involves preventing the use of `__proto__` as a section name during the parsing of the property file.
- The content describes common prototype pollution attack types like DoS, RCE, and property injection attacks.
- It provides prevention recommendations, including freezing the prototype, schema validation, avoiding unsafe merges, and using objects without prototypes.
