#### Description

<https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-bui.pdf> describes a named pipe privilege vulnerability, specifically for MySQL, where an unprivileged user, located on the same machine as the server, can act as man-in-the-middle between server and client.

Unprivileged user creates pipe instance, using the same name as the server does, with CreateNamedPipe("\\\\.\\pipe\MySQL",...), and waits until an unsuspected client connects to this instance. Once client is connected, "man-in-the-middle" also connects as client to the real server process with CreateFile("\\\.\\pipe\MySQL", ....) and acts as a proxy (forwards and reads clear-text messages between the real server, and the real client).

To avoid the vulnerability, ACL on named pipe should exclude FILE\_CREATE\_PIPE\_INSTANCE for anyone but the creator.
