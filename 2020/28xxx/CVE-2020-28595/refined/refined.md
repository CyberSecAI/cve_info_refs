Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28595

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `load_obj()` function within the `Obj.cpp` file of PrusaSlicer. This occurs due to an incorrect calculation of the required buffer size and subsequent out-of-bounds write during the processing of `.obj` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** The code allocates a buffer on the heap to store facet data from the `.obj` file. The size of the buffer is calculated based on the number of faces and quads in the model. However, the code increments an index (`i_face`) based on the number of vertices processed. When processing quad faces, the index `i_face` can be incremented twice within the same loop iteration, leading to `i_face` exceeding the allocated buffer size, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.
- **Potential Out-of-bounds Read:**  The code increments the vertex index `i` to access vertices during processing. When processing triangles, after reading three vertices of a triangle, if the fourth vertex is accessed it results in an out-of-bounds read. This can lead to the out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By providing a specially crafted `.obj` file, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds write. This can overwrite adjacent memory on the heap, potentially leading to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can provide a malicious `.obj` file to the PrusaSlicer application. When the application attempts to load and parse the file, the vulnerability is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.obj` file to the PrusaSlicer application. This could be done by tricking a user into opening the file or by using a vulnerable service.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is in `PrusaSlicer/src/libslic3r/Format/OBJ.cpp` specifically within the `load_obj` function.
- The code iterates through the vertices in a loop. Within the loop if a quad is found, the index into a buffer is incremented twice. This double increment can cause an out-of-bounds write.
- The size of the buffer is based on the number of faces (triangles and quads), but during parsing, the code increments an index based on the number of vertices processed, and quad faces will lead to double increments of this index causing the write to go out of bounds.
- The vulnerability is triggered by .obj files that have a specific vertex count that passes sanity checks but then results in the heap buffer overflow when the facet data is parsed. Files that have a vertex count where `x % 4 == 3` will pass the initial checks, and then trigger the out-of-bounds write when the facet is processed.
- The vulnerability affects PrusaSlicer version 2.2.0 and master (commit 4b040b856)
