Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper index validation within the Nef polygon parsing functionality of the CGAL library. Specifically, when reading files containing Nef polygon data, the code directly uses input values as indices into various vectors (e.g., `Edge_of`, `Vertex_of`, `SLoop_of`, `SFace_of`, `SEdge_of`, `Halffacet_of`, `Volume_of`) without verifying that these indices are within the bounds of the vectors. This can lead to out-of-bounds read and write operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The code attempts to access memory locations outside the allocated bounds of the vectors, which can result in reading from arbitrary memory locations.
- **Type Confusion:** Because the code uses unchecked indices to assign object members to vector items,  different object types can be mixed and the program will attempt to dereference these invalid objects later on.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The parsing code does not validate the input indexes before using them to access vector elements.
- **Missing Bounds Checks:** There is a lack of proper checks to ensure that the indexes used to access vector elements are within the valid bounds of the vector.
  

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** By providing a specially crafted malformed file that exploits the out-of-bounds reads and type confusion, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input File:** The attacker provides a specially crafted `.nef3` or similar file containing malformed Nef polygon data. This file is then processed by the vulnerable CGAL library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the malformed input file to an application that uses the vulnerable CGAL library for processing Nef polygon data. This could be via a local file system, through network access, or other input methods, depending on how the application is used.

**CVE-2020-28618 Specifics:**

Specifically for CVE-2020-28618, the vulnerability exists in `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_vertex()` at the line assigning `vh->shalfloop()`, where `vh->shalfloop()` is assigned an out-of-bounds value from `SLoop_of`.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided information describes a large number of related vulnerabilities, all stemming from the same root cause of improper index validation.
-   The advisory from talosintelligence.com provides a comprehensive description and example of the vulnerable code pattern.
-   The Debian and Gentoo advisories confirm the scope of affected versions and offer remediation steps.

In summary, CVE-2020-28618, along with the other related CVEs, is a serious vulnerability due to the potential for arbitrary code execution through carefully crafted input files that leverage out-of-bounds reads and type confusion in the CGAL library's Nef polygon parsing code.
