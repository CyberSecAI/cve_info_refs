Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a static username and password being hardcoded within a shared library (`libhipcam.so`). This library is used by the Apexis Streaming Video Web Application on Geeni GNC-CW013 doorbell devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the inclusion of static, unchangeable login credentials within the device's software.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The use of these static credentials allows unauthorized access to the camera system's administrative functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** A remote attacker who knows the hardcoded credentials can gain complete control of the camera device. This likely includes the ability to view live feeds, control the camera, and potentially alter device settings.
*   **High-Privileged Access:**  The attacker gains a high-privileged account, granting extensive control over the camera's functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the device.
*   **Web Application Interface:** The attacker uses the web application interface, which is intended for legitimate users, to log in with the hardcoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device, indicating a LAN or Internet-connected device.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker must know the static username and password compiled into the library. This information is not meant to be public.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Merkury Innovations (likely the parent company of Geeni) on November 21, 2020.
*   The affected product is the Geeni GNC-CW013 Doorbell, version 1.8.1.
*   The vulnerability is documented in a PDF found at `https://research.fit.edu/media/site-specific/researchfitedu/iot-lab/Geeni_Disclosures.pdf`

In summary, CVE-2020-28999 highlights a critical security flaw in Geeni doorbell devices caused by embedding static credentials in a shared library, allowing remote attackers to gain full control of the camera.
