Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the EyouCMS application. Specifically, the `addonFieldExt[content]` parameter within the user article submission form is vulnerable to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores user-provided input (`addonFieldExt[content]`) containing malicious JavaScript without adequate sanitization. When this stored data is later displayed to other users (in this case, administrators reviewing submitted articles), the malicious script executes within their browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user, potentially leading to account takeover.
    - Redirect to malicious websites.
    - Deface the web page.
    - Access sensitive information visible within the browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the user article submission form available in the member center of EyouCMS.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code in the `addonFieldExt[content]` parameter within an article submission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the EyouCMS application.
- They must be able to access the user article submission form.
- No elevated privileges are required initially; however, the impact is amplified when an administrator reviews the injected content.
