Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-28022:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `extract_option()` function when parsing name-value parameters from MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands. Specifically, the function incorrectly decrements the `v` (value) and consequently `n` (name) pointers outside the bounds of the `smtp_cmd_data` buffer, potentially into the preceding `smtp_cmd_buffer`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap Out-of-bounds Read and Write:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read and write due to the pointer arithmetic going beyond the allocated memory for the command data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Potential Remote Code Execution:** The advisory suggests that this could potentially lead to remote code execution as the "exim" user. However, they were unable to achieve reliable exploitation during the analysis.

**Attack vectors:**
-  **Crafted SMTP commands:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted MAIL FROM or RCPT TO commands to the Exim server with manipulated name=value parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated remote attacker:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to send SMTP commands to the Exim server.

**Technical Details:**
- The `extract_option()` function is used to parse name-value parameters in SMTP commands.
- The function uses a loop to find the '=' character separating the name and value. It iterates backwards through the `smtp_cmd_data` buffer.
- A check is done for quoted values, and inside this check the `v` pointer can be decremented outside the buffer boundary.
- After decrementing `v`, the function attempts to write to and read from `v` and `n`, which points to an area before `smtp_cmd_data`
- `extract_option()` is called from  `smtp_setup_msg()`, which leads to reads and writes outside of the intended buffer in the calling function as well.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Exim version 4.89.
- While the vulnerability is described, it mentions that exploitation is not straightforward, and the researchers were unable to fully exploit it on its own.
- The vulnerability is used in their proof-of-concept for CVE-2020-28026.
