{
  "CVE-2020-28016": {
    "Root cause": "Heap out-of-bounds write in `parse_fix_phrase()` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "When processing an empty `originator_name` via `-F ''` option, `parse_fix_phrase()` allocates a zero-sized buffer but writes a null byte to `buffer[1]`, resulting in a heap out-of-bounds write."
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows a local attacker to cause a heap out-of-bounds write, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attacker can execute Exim with an empty originator_name using the `-F ''` command-line option."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access is required to execute the exim binary with the specific command line arguments."
  }
}
