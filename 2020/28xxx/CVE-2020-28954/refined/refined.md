Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28954:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input sanitization of the `fullName` parameter in the join API of BigBlueButton. Specifically, control characters were not being filtered from the user's name. This could cause issues with some XML parsers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation. The `fullName` parameter in the join API was not sanitized, allowing users to inject control characters into the system. This could lead to denial-of-service or other unexpected behavior, particularly when the user's name is processed by XML parsers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability could include:
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious users could potentially inject control characters that could crash or cause issues in the XML parser used by the application, thus leading to a denial of service.
*   **Unexpected behavior:** The presence of control characters might lead to other unforeseen issues during data processing.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
1.  Using the join API to send a request.
2.  Including a malicious `fullName` parameter that contains control characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would require:
*   The ability to make calls to the BigBlueButton join API.
*   No special permissions are required beyond that of a normal user.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network or in any privileged position.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `5c911ddeec4493f40f42e2f137800ed4692004a4` by sanitizing the fullName parameter in the join API to remove control characters.
*   A subsequent commit `e59bcd0c33a6a3203c011faa8823ba2cac1e4f37` extended the fix by applying sanitization to all received parameters. This second commit sanitizes all the input parameters to prevent further issues with control character injection.
* The fix involves using `StringUtils.strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace and `replaceAll("\\p{Cntrl}", "")` to remove control characters.
