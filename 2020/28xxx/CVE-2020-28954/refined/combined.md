## Description

The join API is not filtering for control characters in user name.

This can be a problem for some XML parsers.

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v2.2.28...v2.2.29`
