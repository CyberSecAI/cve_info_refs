Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28443:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `sonar-wrapper` npm package, specifically within the `lib/sonarRunner.js` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before passing it to the underlying operating system shell. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands which will be executed by the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **High Confidentiality Impact:** A successful exploit could lead to the attacker gaining access to sensitive data within the impacted component.
- **High Integrity Impact:** The attacker could modify or delete files/data managed by the impacted component.
- **High Availability Impact:** The attacker could render the component or the service it provides unavailable.
- The vulnerability could lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, potentially across network hops. It is exploitable at the protocol level.
- The attacker can provide a malicious string through the `options` parameter, which is then used to execute commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to files or settings.
- User interaction is not required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker simply needs to be able to send requests to the component where the `sonar-wrapper` is used, as the vulnerability can be triggered by providing malicious input to the 'options' parameter.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A code snippet demonstrates how to inject a command using the `options` parameter:
    ```javascript
    var root = require("sonar-wrapper");
    var options= {'sonar.projectName':'& touch JHU'};
    root.runAnalisys('./',options, []);
    ```
    This PoC shows that an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system by including them within the `sonar.projectName` parameter.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the `sonar-wrapper` package are affected.
*   **Fix:** There is no fixed version available for the package.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as a critical severity with a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8

This information provides a clear understanding of the command injection vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
