Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-28921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `PCADRVX64.sys` kernel driver, which is part of the PC Analyser application, has an insecure implementation that allows unprivileged user-mode programs to read and write arbitrary Model Specific Registers (MSRs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary MSR Access:** The driver exposes IOCTLs that allow user-mode applications to read and write to any MSR.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** No proper access control is present, allowing low-privilege users to perform actions that should be restricted to the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Ring-0 Code Execution:** By manipulating MSRs, an attacker can gain the ability to execute code at the kernel level.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privilege user can escalate their privileges to that of the kernel (Ring 0) and take control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **IOCTL Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the driver's IOCTL interface.
- **User-Mode Application:** An attacker would craft a user-mode application to communicate with the vulnerable driver via the IOCTL interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account but does not need administrator rights to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Driver Installation:** The driver must be installed and loaded on the system prior to exploitation. If the driver is not already installed, the attacker would need administrator rights to install it, though the vulnerability itself can be exploited from a lower level once installed.
- **Knowledge of IOCTLs and MSRs:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable IOCTLs ( `0x82002000` for reading, `0x82002100` for writing) as well as specific MSRs they wish to modify for an exploit, such as `IA32_LSTAR` (`0xC0000082`) or `IA32_SYSENTER_EIP` (`0x00000176`).

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited to patch critical MSRs such as `IA32_LSTAR` or `IA32_SYSENTER_EIP` to execute arbitrary code.
- Despite mitigations such as SMEP and SMAP being in place on modern Windows 10 systems (as of November 2020), this exploit is still viable.

**Resolution:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.10 of the PC Analyser application, which includes an updated version of the driver.

**Disclosure Timeline:**

- 16 November 2020: Vulnerability reported to the vendor.
- 16 November 2020: Vendor acknowledged the issue.
- 19 November 2020: Vendor provided a test version with the fix.
- 25 November 2020: Vendor released the patched application.
