Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the image upload function of the "custom component" of Jeecg Boot. Specifically, the issue lies within the `CommonController.java` file at line 76, which doesn't properly sanitize or validate uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including malicious ones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the lack of restrictions on the type of files that can be uploaded. The application does not properly validate or sanitize the file extension, which allows an attacker to upload files with any extension, including executable ones like `.jsp`, `.php`, etc.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The system does not validate the content or the extension of uploaded files.
- **Directly Accessible Upload Endpoint:** The endpoint `/jeecg-boot/sys/common/upload` is directly accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading malicious executable files (e.g., web shells), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Data Breaches:** Once the system is compromised, attackers could steal sensitive data, including user information, application data, etc.
- **System Defacement:** Attackers could modify the application's content and deface the website.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could upload large files and cause a denial of service or make it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network using HTTP requests to the `/jeecg-boot/sys/common/upload` endpoint.
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered through the file upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server where the Jeecg Boot application is deployed.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, manipulating the uploaded file data, particularly the file extension and content.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was found in version 2.3 of Jeecg Boot.
- The provided screenshots demonstrate how the attacker can intercept the upload request, modify the file extension, and successfully upload the malicious file.
