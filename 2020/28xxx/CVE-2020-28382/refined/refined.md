Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-28382:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files in Siemens Solid Edge Viewer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The inadequate input validation leads to a write operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure. This means data can be written to unintended memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PAR Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious PAR file containing specially crafted data that triggers the out-of-bounds write.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability through Solid Edge Viewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access/file:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious PAR file to the victim. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening the file.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must take the action of opening the malicious file with the vulnerable application, Solid Edge Viewer.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory from Siemens (SSA-979834) confirms that CVE-2020-28382 is related to out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing PAR files.
* The vulnerability affects Solid Edge versions prior to SE2020MP12 and SE2021MP2.
* Siemens recommends limiting the opening of untrusted files from unknown sources in Solid Edge as a mitigation.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8.
* The identified CWE is CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.
