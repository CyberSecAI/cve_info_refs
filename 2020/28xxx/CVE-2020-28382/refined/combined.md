## Siemens Solid Edge Viewer PAR File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-075ZDI-CAN-11920

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-28382](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-28382) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Solid Edge Viewer |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens Solid Edge Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PAR files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Siemens has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-979834: Multiple vulnerabilities in Solid Edge

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2021-01-12

V1.1

SUMMARY

Solid Edge is affected by multiple vulnerabilities that could allow arbitrary code execution on an affected
system. Siemens has released an update for Solid Edge and recommends to update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

Solid Edge SE2020:
All Versions < SE2020MP12

Solid Edge SE2021:
All Versions < SE2021MP2

Update to Version SE2020MP12 or later
https://support.sw.siemens.com/ (login required)

Update to Version SE2021MP2 or later
https://support.sw.siemens.com/ (login required)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Siemens recommends to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in Solid Edge

• Applying a Defense-in-Depth concept can help to reduce the probability that untrusted code is run
on the system. Siemens recommends to apply the Defense-in-Depth concept: https://www.siemens.
com/industrialsecurity

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes : 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28381

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR ﬁles. This could
result in an out of bounds write into uninitialized memory. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability
to execute code in the context of the current process.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28382

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR ﬁles. This could
result in a out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this
vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
