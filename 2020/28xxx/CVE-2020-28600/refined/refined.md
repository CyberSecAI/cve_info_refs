The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2020-28600, detailing an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in OpenSCAD.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `import_stl` function of OpenSCAD when parsing a malformed STL file.
- Specifically, an error during parsing a vertex coordinate using `boost::lexical_cast<double>` can cause an out-of-bounds write to the `vdata` array, which is allocated on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write due to incorrect handling of parsing errors.
- Stack-based buffer overflow by writing past the bounds of the `vdata` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution due to the memory corruption.
- In the specific crash case, it overwrites a pointer inside a `boost::shared_ptr`, leading to a crash during the destructor. This can be leveraged for more serious attacks potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted STL file to the OpenSCAD application. This could be done by a user opening a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide the malicious STL file to the vulnerable application, which can occur locally if the user opens the file or remotely if the application automatically parses such a file.
- No special privileges are needed. The vulnerability is triggered in userland.
