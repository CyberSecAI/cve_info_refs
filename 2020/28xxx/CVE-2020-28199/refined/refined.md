Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Amazon Pay plugin for Shopware exposes sensitive configuration data, including the Amazon Secret Access Key, through an event-driven mechanism. This occurs when the plugin's configuration is attached to template variables during controller actions, even when the template rendering is disabled.
- The vulnerability is triggered in combination with a second plugin that disables template rendering and outputs JSON (e.g., the "Bundles" plugin). This bypasses the intended protection of template context and directly exposes the configuration data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The Amazon Secret Access Key, which should be kept confidential, is exposed in the JSON response.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin's design doesn't properly restrict access to sensitive configuration data. It attaches the full configuration to controller actions without proper checks, regardless of the intended output format.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:**  The configuration is passed through without sanitization, allowing it to be exposed even when not required for view rendering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can obtain the Amazon Secret Access Key.
- **Integrity Violation:** With the access key, an attacker could potentially manipulate Amazon Pay transactions or access related resources within the Amazon Pay account.
- **Availability issues:** An attacker might be able to cause denial of service by using the stolen keys.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Specific URL:** An attacker sends a request to a specific URL provided by a plugin which deactivates the view renderer (e.g., `/widgets/Bundle/isBundleAvailable`).
- **Combination of plugins:** The vulnerability is exploited when the vulnerable Amazon Pay plugin is used in combination with a second plugin that deactivates the view renderer (e.g., the Bundles plugin).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No privileges are required.**
- **User interaction is required** to initiate the request to the vulnerable URL.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL of a site using both vulnerable plugins and send a request to that URL.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided details include a proof of concept (PoC) which describes how to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The vendor released a fix in version 9.4.2 of the Amazon Pay plugin.
- A key rollover is recommended after updating the plugin.
