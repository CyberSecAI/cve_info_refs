    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-28630",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of Nef polygon data where an integer is read from the input and used as an index into a vector without proper bounds checking.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read",
        "Type confusion",
        "Improper validation of array index (CWE-129)"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to out-of-bounds read and type confusion when dereferencing objects obtained with malformed index.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted .nef3 file"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to provide a malicious input file to the CGAL library."
      ],
       "details": "Specifically, in `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h` within the `SNC_io_parser::read_sedge()` function, the `seh->snext()` member is assigned an `SEdge_of` object via an index read directly from the input file without any validation."
