### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

TCL TV Vulnerability CVE-2020-28055](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TCL-CVE-2020-28055.png)

### Title

TCL Android Smart TV (All) – Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Vendor Resources – TCL Android TV Vendor Configuration & Upgrade Folders World Writable to Local Attacker

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-28055

### CVSS Score

7.8

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2020-012

### Vendor

TCL Technology Group Corporation

### Product

TCL Android Smart TV Firmware (All)

### Product Versions:

V8-R851T02-LF1 V295 and below

Many models affected (untested)

### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability in the TCL Android Smart TV series by TCL Technology Group Corporation allows a local unprivileged attacker, such as a malicious App, to read and write to critical vendor resource directories within the Android TV file system, including the vendor upgrades folder.

The following three critical resource folders are assigned permissions of 0777 by the vendor rc file located at /system/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.rtd285o.rc from line 344:

/data/vendor/tcl

/data/vendor/upgrade

/var/TerminalManager

This allows a local unprivileged user, or a malicious APK, to modify critical system resources. For example, by modifying the /data/vendor/upgrade folder, an attacker could potentially cause the Android TV to undergo arbitrary vendor system upgrades.

### Vendor Response

None.

<https://nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28055>

#### Mitigation

The following firmware updates do not refer to the Android system updates; updates refer to the vendor specific third-party firmware updates provided by TCL.

* Update to the latest over-the-air (OTA) vendor firmware from TCL.

Or

* Update to the latest vendor firmware from the TCL website using a USB drive and the firmware update method for your model.

*TCL Android Smart TVs cannot be manually patched without root user access (rooted).*

TCL Smart TVs that are not rooted cannot be manually updated other than using OTA or USB update methods.

Offline TVs are low risk because there are no attackers on the adjacent network.

If your TV is in a high-risk environment, and you are unable to update the vendor firmware, it is recommended to disable internet access on the TCL Android TV until patched.

**Manual or offline TV updates require elevated permissions to fix this vulnerability and cannot be patched without root user access:**

```
chmod 0770 /data/vendor/tcl /data/vendor/upgrade /var/TerminalManager
```

If your TV is in a high-risk environment, and you are unable to update the vendor firmware, it is recommended to disable internet access on the TCL Android TV until patched.

**Manual or offline TV updates require elevated permissions to fix this vulnerability and cannot be patched without root user access:**

```
chmod 0770 /data/vendor/tcl /data/vendor/upgrade /var/TerminalManager
```

### Title

TCL Android Smart TV (All) - Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Vendor Resources - TCL Android TV Vendor Configuration & Upgrade Folders World Writable to Local Attacker

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-28055

### CVSS Score

7.8

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2020-012

### Vendor

TCL Technology Group Corporation

### Product

TCL Android Smart TV Firmware (All)

### Product Versions:

V8-R851T02-LF1 V295 and below

V8-T658T01-LF1 V373 and below

Many models affected (untested)

### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability in the TCL Android Smart TV series by TCL Technology Group Corporation allows a local unprivileged attacker, such as a malicious App, to read and write to critical vendor resource directories within the Android TV file system, including the vendor upgrades folder.

The following three critical resource folders are assigned permissions of 0777 by the vendor rc file located at /system/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.rtd285o.rc from line 344:

/data/vendor/tcl

/data/vendor/upgrade

/var/TerminalManager

This allows a local unprivileged user, or a malicious APK, to modify critical system resources. For example, by modifying the /data/vendor/upgrade folder, an attacker could potentially cause the Android TV to undergo arbitrary vendor system upgrades.

### Vendor Response

Vendor notified by email in response to .

#### Mitigation

The following firmware updates do not refer to the Android system updates; updates refer to the vendor specific third-party firmware updates provided by TCL.

* Update to the latest over-the-air (OTA) vendor firmware from TCL.

Or

* Update to the latest vendor firmware from the TCL website using a USB drive and the firmware update method for your model.

*TCL Android Smart TV's cannot be manually patched without root user access (rooted).*

TCL Smart TV's that are not rooted cannot be manually updated other than using OTA or USB update methods.

Offline TV's are low risk because there are no attackers on the adjacent network.

If your TV is in a high-risk environment, and you are unable to update the vendor firmware, it is recommended to disable internet access on the TCL Android TV until patched.

**Manual or offline TV updates require elevated permissions to fix this vulnerability and cannot be patched without root user access:**

```
chmod 0770 /data/vendor/tcl /data/vendor/upgrade /var/TerminalManager
```

TCL Android TV Vulnerability](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TCL-Android-TV-Vulnerability-L.png)

The following piece is the culmination of a three-month long investigation into Smart TVs running Android. Having lived through this research experience, I can wholeheartedly say that there were multiple moments that I, and another security researcher that I met along the way, couldn’t believe what was happening. On multiple occasions I found myself feeling as though, “you couldn’t even make this up…”

I’m a security researcher, a freelance developer, and a hacker.

Please follow me on Twitter [@sickcodes](https://twitter.com/sickcodes) here: <https://twitter.com/sickcodes>

The second researcher in this story is John Jackson: <https://twitter.com/johnjhacking>, an Application Security Engineer with Shutterstock, and a hacker.

We met about half way through this, and I have included his experience too.

## UPDATE: April 2, 2021. TCL now has a VDP! <https://src.tcl.com/en/index>

Since our research was published in November 2020, many things happened both positive and negative. One very impressive positive outcome is TCL has actually taken on-board many of the suggestions we made regarding their security. In my professional opinion, I think it is one of the most comprehensive Bug Bounty programs I’ve seen. They made some very impressive changes and John & myself (sickcodes) are pretty impressed: <https://src.tcl.com/en/index>

## Initial Research

Near the end of September, while conducting research into low-end Android boxes, I came across a number of serious flaws in the way in which these devices were being designed.

Without delving into the nuances of each device, all of the Smart TV products are Android based.

There are four types of TV products in the TV market:

1. TV Sticks
2. TV Boxes
3. Smart TVs
4. Android TVs

All of them are ARM based single board computers (SBCs). Most of the dies are 32bit, some are 64bit, but all of them are like a little Raspberry Pi competitor, focusing on GPU performance through the small, but powerful, Mali GPUs.

Some of the products that I investigated were “factory-flawed” and deliberately insecure.

## First Blood

On 2020-09-20, I discovered some ridiculous security shortfalls in the TV Sticks.

*NOTE: TCL does not make TV sticks that are vulnerable. Only TCL Android TVs are affected. The following vulnerabilities refer to other products that I was testing at the time before finding the TCL vulnerability that is discussed in depth after the nmap scaps below.*

Each stick that I tested had at least one of the following major security flaws.

* Port 22 open and allowing SSH access as root:root out of the box
* Port 5555 open and allowing unauthenticated android (adb) as root:root out of the box
* Rooted device, with world-executable su binaries in multiple locations
* Open WiFi network with adb and ssh daemons running

In effect, if you had a thousand of these devices, you could worm through all of them, taking advantage of the dual WiFi, plain-text WAN router credentials, and the ability to then hop from the TV stick, to the router, MITM the router, search for more vulnerable devices from the larger, more powerful router, and truly “surf the internet”.

**Proof of Concept**

```
# connect to the device's open WiFi network without any password
adb connect 192.168.1.1
adb shell
su
whoami
# root
```

Having witnessed how dismal the security was on these devices, or lack thereof, my plan was to write a really big proof of concept, in the form of an actual shell based worm, that would hop between the 4 or 5 TV sticks that I had.

Speaking to an associate about my idea, we ended up chatting about real Android TVs.

Suddenly, I thought, “If these sticks are the same, just little Rockchip & Amlogic CPUs, then what is so special about Smart TVs?”

Since I don’t actually have an Android Television to test, I asked my friend what type of Smart TV does he have and is it running Android?

His answer was, “TCL and not sure.”

I hadn’t really heard much about TCL, but it turns out TCL is a huge Chinese electronics manufacturing company.

TCL has been growing their global market share, at a remarkable rate.

According to a Forbes article, they only launched in the United States in 2013 and sales began on Amazon: <https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2016/11/14/how-a-no-name-chinese-tv-brand-came-to-dominate-the-amazon-charts/?sh=15fd0d52f096>

![TV market share 2008 2020](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tv-market-share-2008-2020.png)

With their Amazon success, TCL began targeting other large markets.

The key point here is that they aren’t Samsung or LG, but they ARE selling millions of TV sets…

We did a remote desktop session and I ran a trivial nmap scan on the TV to see what it was running out of the box.

Here is the nmap scan:

```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-16 21:55 UTC
…

…
Completed Service scan at 21:58, 156.41s elapsed (14 services on 1 host)
Not shown: 65521 closed ports
```

If you nmap your Android mobile phone, you will generally find 0 open TCP ports.

**Zero.**

So why does a TV need so many open ports?

While there are some reasons why TVs should have open ports, some of the above services warranted much deeper investigation.

Since I was in a remote desktop session, I just entered all the URLs manually into his web browser.

Port 7989 was showing a 404 error, yet when I visit 10.0.0.117:7989 in the browser, an error is shown.

http://10.0.0.117:7989 did not return a page in the browser.

![TCL directory file structure](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tcl-directory-file-structure.png)

What kind of special web server doesn’t show an index page, but shows deeper pages?

I had recently done research on an IoT device that was serving CGI scripts from the / directory, so the first page I thought to test was init.rc

*http://10.0.0.117:7989/init.rc*

403 Forbidden.

Yikes.

This means that the file is exists but we are not authorized to view it.

Naturally, I tested some other Android directories:

*http://10.0.0.117:7989/sdcard*

![TCL directory file structure vulnerability](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tcl-directory-file-structure-vulnerability.png)

TCL directory file structure vulnerability

If you work with computers, no matter whether it be mobile apps, web apps, websites, back-end, front-end, upend…

Ask yourself this question right now:

> *When in the history of your career…*
> *Have you ever needed to serve the entire filesystem…*
> *over http?*

This becomes a really import question because this custom vendor firmware is currently installed in millions of TCL Android TVs around the world.

My friend who was actually on the phone to me while we were doing the remote desktop, was fairly surprised.

“Why can we see all the files in the TV?”

Port 7989 is not on the list of standard TCP/UDP ports by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

This means, without scanning all 65,535 ports, most scanners will skip that port.

Secondly, the actual root page is blank.

So in order to scan more than 1 page per port, port scan times will exponentially increase…

Curiously, I checked the IANA list for other ports that end with 989:

| ftps-data | 989 | tcp | ftp protocol, data, over TLS/SSL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tr-rsrb-p3 | 1989 | tcp | cisco |
| mshnet | 1989 | tcp | MHSnet |
| zarkov | 2989 | tcp | ZARKOV |
| bv-queryengine | 3989 | tcp | BindView-Query |
| parallel | 4989 | tcp | Parallel |
| wbem-https | 5989 | tcp | WBEM |
| sunwebadmins | 8989 | tcp | Sun |
|  | 9989-9989 |  | Unassigned |
|  | 10934-10989 |  | Unassigned |

Notably, 6989 and 7989 are missing.

In fact, the range 7983-7997 is unassigned by IANA.

Why would an Android device need a web server running on a non-standard port?

What kind of manufacturer publishes the whole file system of a device?

## Contact Tracing – CVE-2020-27403

At this point, I drafted the first CVE Request and sent it off to MITRE.

A copy of the draft advisory was sent to TCL’s security@tcl.com email address, requesting that they confirm receipt of the report.

The email bounced, so I submitted a contact form via their website requesting immediate support and escalation to the security department.

As this was a Friday, I was not expecting a reply, but a few days passed by and MITRE did not reply either.

I double checked that the device was not covered by another Certificate Numbering Authority (CNA) and ended up working out, to my surprise, that TCL Corporation owns Alcatel.

In fact, they also own(ed) Blackberry Mobile.

Both of those brands are Open Handset Alliance members, and they are covered by the Google Android CNA.

So I resubmitted the report to the Android CNA.

A few more days passed and no reply from anyone yet.

Then I contacted a friend who put me in touch with a researcher, who had a contact of someone at the company. I emailed them.

Yet again, no reply.

I then publicly requested contact details of anyone at the TCL security team in this thread: https://community.disclose.io/t/looking-for-security-contact-at-tcl-corporation/39

Another researcher named John Jackson replied, and we connected on Twitter.

John had recently gone through a messy public disclosure with a company that threatened to sue him even though they had already stated, in writing, “the bug does not exist.”

This is where things get tough.

## Requests for Assistance

*John: I was browsing the disclose.io boards and saw Sick Codes’ post requesting assistance with disclosure for a major vulnerability that he found on TCL’s Smart TVs.*

*Seeing that he had attempted to contact the company through their phone support, contact forms, twitter, and email addresses – it was obvious that he wasn’t getting any response.*

*First and foremost, I replied on the board and connected with him on Twitter to validate the authenticity of the vulnerability.*

*It seemed like a legitimate issue, the Smart TV was exposing a random port and I could see a bunch of files on the client side. Working with Sick Codes, I dug a little deeper into the filesystem and noted that a lot of sensitive files could be accessed.*

*Nonetheless, not all of the sensitive files looked accessible and there were certain permission restrictions such as accessing the sensitive configuration files.*

*Turns out, a built-in directory existed on the TV and maintained root level permissions. The directory was nearly an identical clone of the exposed filesystem, and allowed us to circumvent any issues accessing various critical files*

*It was clear that utilizing this vulnerability could result in remote code execution or even quick network pivots with the intention of exploiting systems quickly with ransomware.*

*With a vast list of affected TV models enumerated from the exposed filesystem on the client-side, [or in other words millions of vulnerable TVs] I set out to help Sick Codes in the disclosure process.*

*Unfortunately, the result of my attempted disclosure was nearly identical to Sick Codes’, resulting in no response on Social Media or Email.*

*I called TCL and talked to a support representative. I urged her that we had a serious vulnerability on our hands and she stated that she had no contact info to the Security team, and didn’t even think/know if TCL had a Security team. She asked me if I wanted to disclose the vulnerability over the phone so that she could submit it into the ticketing system: I said no. It’s generally not the best practice to expose a highly sensitive vulnerability via a shared ticketed system.*

*Obviously, we had to approach other methodology so I contacted CERT to ask for assistance in disclosure. CERT did not respond to us initially.*

*Days later Sick Codes managed to acquire a name and point of contact at TCL. We reached out and after about a week, the company had acknowledged the vulnerability and stated that they would patch the issue. We asked for updates over the course of weeks, but they stopped responding to us. CERT finally responded and told us to disclose the vulnerability if that was the case.*

*Respectfully, John Jackson*

# Part 2: Backdoor Update Vulnerability – CVE-2020-28055

Sick Codes here again. It took 13 days for TCL Corporation to reply to our initial report.

Almost 2 weeks to confirm receipt of a security report, from the World’s 3rd largest TV manufacturer.

Second to that, but the TCL Security team actually confirmed in the same email, that they had fixed the vulnerability.

Serious questions must be raised at this point. Why did it take two weeks to reply, and how was it so easy to fix?

What Android service was stopped in the fix?

Will the TV function as expected without this overly permissive directory allowing anyone on the same network to download files on the TV?

It was at this time, I decided to try find some more vulnerabilities while we had the attention of the security team.

I went digging through .rc files looking for vendor specific changes.

Indeed, there were critical changes made by TCL to several folders on the TV file system that should be absolutely locked down.

In the file:

/system/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.rtd285o.rc

I found the following critical errors:

```
#tcl save data directory
mkdir /data/vendor/tcl 0777
#tcl oad data directory
mkdir /data/vendor/upgrade 0777
mkdir /var/TerminalManager 0777
```

This means that these folders are now writable, by all users on the file system.

/data/vendor/tcl contains critical files to operate the TV.

These files should not be writable by arbitrary users, or potentially malicious apps or APKs.

One can only guess what consequences having read & write access to the TCL updates folder might have…

Secondly, what I found in “TerminalManager\_Remote” was a little head-turning:

TerminalManager is an App, named TerminalManager\_Remote.apk

Unpacking the APK contains the following configuration file.

As much as I’d like to answer the big question here, I don’t know if I can.

I don’t have the answer. TCL does, however.

The TV that I conducted preliminary tests on was silently patched. No update warning was sent.

The fact that they were able to identify the vulnerability, and have patched it on their side automatically, without user input is also lightly striking.

Please make your own conclusions from our research.

If you want more research write-ups and investigations, then keep us both on Twitter.

   Please help!!! Everything I have read on this page is exactly what has been automatically installing on every 10 devices I own. I can not escape it and I feel so invaded. These hackers or whatever have complete control of all my devices and legit install fake apps and websites. Heck, this post probably won’t even go through. Everytime I look for help, it ends up being the hacker actually telling me how to hack instead of helping.

     Same issue. Lots of traffic coming from TV throughout LAN. Scan showed similar ports to this write up. Have tried all sorts, don’t want to throw everything out and start over and feel there must be a resolution.

    <http://192.168.1.111:49153> (Philips 55PUS7503/12 Smart Android TV) gives only a “404 page not found” error. Tried to extend that address with Android directories and init.rc but they all gave a “404 page not found” error.

    <http://192.168.1.111:9080> gives “Status=OK” message but nothing else. Then there are few other ports that give an error message “didn’t send any data” when tried on a web browser.

      This means you are okay.

      `Status=OK` is some api that is used, health checking.

      If nothing showed /init.rc as 403 forbidden, then it’s most likely that you are not vulnerable.

    I am just starting to root around in my hisense 65″ qled android TV. I don’t recall the model number but it is a 2020 device. I have not found anything as egregious as what is described here, though I am still exploring the open ports I have found (which is what brought me here).

    To use an android TV safely in spite of its vulnerabilities, put it on its own VLAN and also put a VPN proxy on that VLAN. Direct the TV to use the VPN proxy as its gateway. On the upstream router, block all access to the VLAN from either direction, except for access required by the VPN proxy. Then, connect the TV to the VLAN using an ethernet connection. This likely will require you to use a trunking switch, but will lock your TV down completely.

    No inbound connections from anywhere will arrive at the TV; the VPN will prevent that because the external VPN server (the other end of your tunnel) will have no idea how to route any inbound traffic that is aimed at your TV, and the address of that remote server will show as the address of your TV. This prevents any remote control of the TV.

    I do this, and in addition I run a DNS server on my network (pihole) which is configured to block all the tracking that the TV tries to do.

      Very nice setup! Fully isolating devices like you have done should be much more commonplace these days. Thanks for the comment!

    I have a

    It recently updated to Android 10.

    I’m wondering if this TV has security issues. I always get messages that say there’s vulnerabilities if I cast something to the TV.

      Roku TV’s are fine. We spoke to Roku and they are not vulnerable to this issue. This specifically affects TCL Android TVs.

      TCL Roku TVs are fine, even though they most likely come from the same factory.

    I think it’s obvious what they are doing: mass surveillance for their government, which of course is a majority owner of every company which operates inside of the country.

      I can’t say with certainty anything, but they do have to absolute ability to control the TV remotely.

TCL TV Vulnerability CVE-2020-28055](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TCL-CVE-2020-28055.png)

### Title

TCL Android Smart TV (All) – Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Vendor Resources – TCL Android TV Vendor Configuration & Upgrade Folders World Writable to Local Attacker

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-28055

### CVSS Score

7.8

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2020-012

### Vendor

TCL Technology Group Corporation

### Product

TCL Android Smart TV Firmware (All)

### Product Versions:

V8-R851T02-LF1 V295 and below

Many models affected (untested)

### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability in the TCL Android Smart TV series by TCL Technology Group Corporation allows a local unprivileged attacker, such as a malicious App, to read and write to critical vendor resource directories within the Android TV file system, including the vendor upgrades folder.

The following three critical resource folders are assigned permissions of 0777 by the vendor rc file located at /system/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.rtd285o.rc from line 344:

/data/vendor/tcl

/data/vendor/upgrade

/var/TerminalManager

This allows a local unprivileged user, or a malicious APK, to modify critical system resources. For example, by modifying the /data/vendor/upgrade folder, an attacker could potentially cause the Android TV to undergo arbitrary vendor system upgrades.

### Vendor Response

None.

<https://nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-28055>

#### Mitigation

The following firmware updates do not refer to the Android system updates; updates refer to the vendor specific third-party firmware updates provided by TCL.

* Update to the latest over-the-air (OTA) vendor firmware from TCL.

Or

* Update to the latest vendor firmware from the TCL website using a USB drive and the firmware update method for your model.

*TCL Android Smart TVs cannot be manually patched without root user access (rooted).*

TCL Smart TVs that are not rooted cannot be manually updated other than using OTA or USB update methods.

Offline TVs are low risk because there are no attackers on the adjacent network.

If your TV is in a high-risk environment, and you are unable to update the vendor firmware, it is recommended to disable internet access on the TCL Android TV until patched.

**Manual or offline TV updates require elevated permissions to fix this vulnerability and cannot be patched without root user access:**

```
chmod 0770 /data/vendor/tcl /data/vendor/upgrade /var/TerminalManager
```

TCL TV Vulnerability CVE-2020-28055](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TCL-CVE-2020-28055.png)

### Title

TCL Android Smart TV (All) – Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Vendor Resources – TCL Android TV Vendor Configuration & Upgrade Folders World Writable to Local Attacker

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-28055

### CVSS Score

7.8

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2020-012

### Vendor

TCL Technology Group Corporation

### Product

TCL Android Smart TV Firmware (All)

### Product Versions:

V8-R851T02-LF1 V295 and below

Many models affected (untested)

### Vulnerability Details

A vulnerability in the TCL Android Smart TV series by TCL Technology Group Corporation allows a local unprivileged attacker, such as a malicious App, to read and write to critical vendor resource directories within the Android TV file system, including the vendor upgrades folder.

The following three critical resource folders are assigned permissions of 0777 by the vendor rc file located at /system/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.rtd285o.rc from line 344:

/data/vendor/tcl

/data/vendor/upgrade

/var/TerminalManager

This allows a local unprivileged user, or a malicious APK, to modify critical system resources. For example, by modifying the /data/vendor/upgrade folder, an attacker could potentially cause the Android TV to undergo arbitrary vendor system upgrades.

### Vendor Response

None.

#### Mitigation

The following firmware updates do not refer to the Android system updates; updates refer to the vendor specific third-party firmware updates provided by TCL.

* Update to the latest over-the-air (OTA) vendor firmware from TCL.

Or

* Update to the latest vendor firmware from the TCL website using a USB drive and the firmware update method for your model.

*TCL Android Smart TVs cannot be manually patched without root user access (rooted).*

TCL Smart TVs that are not rooted cannot be manually updated other than using OTA or USB update methods.

Offline TVs are low risk because there are no attackers on the adjacent network.

If your TV is in a high-risk environment, and you are unable to update the vendor firmware, it is recommended to disable internet access on the TCL Android TV until patched.

**Manual or offline TV updates require elevated permissions to fix this vulnerability and cannot be patched without root user access:**

```
chmod 0770 /data/vendor/tcl /data/vendor/upgrade /var/TerminalManager
```

TCL Android TV Vulnerability](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TCL-Android-TV-Vulnerability-L.png)

The following piece is the culmination of a three-month long investigation into Smart TVs running Android. Having lived through this research experience, I can wholeheartedly say that there were multiple moments that I, and another security researcher that I met along the way, couldn’t believe what was happening. On multiple occasions I found myself feeling as though, “you couldn’t even make this up…”

I’m a security researcher, a freelance developer, and a hacker.

Please follow me on Twitter [@sickcodes](https://twitter.com/sickcodes) here: <https://twitter.com/sickcodes>

The second researcher in this story is John Jackson: <https://twitter.com/johnjhacking>, an Application Security Engineer with Shutterstock, and a hacker.

We met about half way through this, and I have included his experience too.

## UPDATE: April 2, 2021. TCL now has a VDP! <https://src.tcl.com/en/index>

Since our research was published in November 2020, many things happened both positive and negative. One very impressive positive outcome is TCL has actually taken on-board many of the suggestions we made regarding their security. In my professional opinion, I think it is one of the most comprehensive Bug Bounty programs I’ve seen. They made some very impressive changes and John & myself (sickcodes) are pretty impressed: <https://src.tcl.com/en/index>

## Initial Research

Near the end of September, while conducting research into low-end Android boxes, I came across a number of serious flaws in the way in which these devices were being designed.

Without delving into the nuances of each device, all of the Smart TV products are Android based.

There are four types of TV products in the TV market:

1. TV Sticks
2. TV Boxes
3. Smart TVs
4. Android TVs

All of them are ARM based single board computers (SBCs). Most of the dies are 32bit, some are 64bit, but all of them are like a little Raspberry Pi competitor, focusing on GPU performance through the small, but powerful, Mali GPUs.

Some of the products that I investigated were “factory-flawed” and deliberately insecure.

## First Blood

On 2020-09-20, I discovered some ridiculous security shortfalls in the TV Sticks.

*NOTE: TCL does not make TV sticks that are vulnerable. Only TCL Android TVs are affected. The following vulnerabilities refer to other products that I was testing at the time before finding the TCL vulnerability that is discussed in depth after the nmap scaps below.*

Each stick that I tested had at least one of the following major security flaws.

* Port 22 open and allowing SSH access as root:root out of the box
* Port 5555 open and allowing unauthenticated android (adb) as root:root out of the box
* Rooted device, with world-executable su binaries in multiple locations
* Open WiFi network with adb and ssh daemons running

In effect, if you had a thousand of these devices, you could worm through all of them, taking advantage of the dual WiFi, plain-text WAN router credentials, and the ability to then hop from the TV stick, to the router, MITM the router, search for more vulnerable devices from the larger, more powerful router, and truly “surf the internet”.

**Proof of Concept**

```
# connect to the device's open WiFi network without any password
adb connect 192.168.1.1
adb shell
su
whoami
# root
```

Having witnessed how dismal the security was on these devices, or lack thereof, my plan was to write a really big proof of concept, in the form of an actual shell based worm, that would hop between the 4 or 5 TV sticks that I had.

Speaking to an associate about my idea, we ended up chatting about real Android TVs.

Suddenly, I thought, “If these sticks are the same, just little Rockchip & Amlogic CPUs, then what is so special about Smart TVs?”

Since I don’t actually have an Android Television to test, I asked my friend what type of Smart TV does he have and is it running Android?

His answer was, “TCL and not sure.”

I hadn’t really heard much about TCL, but it turns out TCL is a huge Chinese electronics manufacturing company.

TCL has been growing their global market share, at a remarkable rate.

According to a Forbes article, they only launched in the United States in 2013 and sales began on Amazon: <https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2016/11/14/how-a-no-name-chinese-tv-brand-came-to-dominate-the-amazon-charts/?sh=15fd0d52f096>

![TV market share 2008 2020](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tv-market-share-2008-2020.png)

With their Amazon success, TCL began targeting other large markets.

The key point here is that they aren’t Samsung or LG, but they ARE selling millions of TV sets…

We did a remote desktop session and I ran a trivial nmap scan on the TV to see what it was running out of the box.

Here is the nmap scan:

```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-16 21:55 UTC
…

…
Completed Service scan at 21:58, 156.41s elapsed (14 services on 1 host)
Not shown: 65521 closed ports
```

If you nmap your Android mobile phone, you will generally find 0 open TCP ports.

**Zero.**

So why does a TV need so many open ports?

While there are some reasons why TVs should have open ports, some of the above services warranted much deeper investigation.

Since I was in a remote desktop session, I just entered all the URLs manually into his web browser.

```
http://10.0.0.117:6550
http://10.0.0.117:8012
http://10.0.0.117:6466
http://10.0.0.117:8009
http://10.0.0.117:9000
http://10.0.0.117:8443
http://10.0.0.117:10101
http://10.0.0.117:46211
http://10.0.0.117:7989
http://10.0.0.117:6467
http://10.0.0.117:6559
http://10.0.0.117:6553
http://10.0.0.117:4332
http://10.0.0.117:8008
```

I also tested the https:// editions:

```
https://10.0.0.117:6550
https://10.0.0.117:8012
https://10.0.0.117:6466

https://10.0.0.117:6553
https://10.0.0.117:4332
https://10.0.0.117:8008
```

Some of the pages were blank white pages. This can indicate an API endpoint.

Some of the pages just hang the browser.

Then the rest of the nmap scan came through…

```

Port 7989 was showing a 404 error, yet when I visit 10.0.0.117:7989 in the browser, an error is shown.

http://10.0.0.117:7989 did not return a page in the browser.

![TCL directory file structure](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tcl-directory-file-structure.png)

What kind of special web server doesn’t show an index page, but shows deeper pages?

I had recently done research on an IoT device that was serving CGI scripts from the / directory, so the first page I thought to test was init.rc

*http://10.0.0.117:7989/init.rc*

403 Forbidden.

Yikes.

This means that the file is exists but we are not authorized to view it.

Naturally, I tested some other Android directories:

*http://10.0.0.117:7989/sdcard*

![TCL directory file structure vulnerability](https://sick.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tcl-directory-file-structure-vulnerability.png)

TCL directory file structure vulnerability

If you work with computers, no matter whether it be mobile apps, web apps, websites, back-end, front-end, upend…

Ask yourself this question right now:

> *When in the history of your career…*
> *Have you ever needed to serve the entire filesystem…*
> *over http?*

This becomes a really import question because this custom vendor firmware is currently installed in millions of TCL Android TVs around the world.

My friend who was actually on the phone to me while we were doing the remote desktop, was fairly surprised.

“Why can we see all the files in the TV?”

Port 7989 is not on the list of standard TCP/UDP ports by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt

This means, without scanning all 65,535 ports, most scanners will skip that port.

Secondly, the actual root page is blank.

So in order to scan more than 1 page per port, port scan times will exponentially increase…

Curiously, I checked the IANA list for other ports that end with 989:

| ftps-data | 989 | tcp | ftp protocol, data, over TLS/SSL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tr-rsrb-p3 | 1989 | tcp | cisco |
| mshnet | 1989 | tcp | MHSnet |
| zarkov | 2989 | tcp | ZARKOV |
| bv-queryengine | 3989 | tcp | BindView-Query |
| parallel | 4989 | tcp | Parallel |
| wbem-https | 5989 | tcp | WBEM |
| sunwebadmins | 8989 | tcp | Sun |
|  | 9989-9989 |  | Unassigned |
|  | 10934-10989 |  | Unassigned |

Notably, 6989 and 7989 are missing.

In fact, the range 7983-7997 is unassigned by IANA.

Why would an Android device need a web server running on a non-standard port?

What kind of manufacturer publishes the whole file system of a device?

## Contact Tracing – CVE-2020-27403

At this point, I drafted the first CVE Request and sent it off to MITRE.

A copy of the draft advisory was sent to TCL’s security@tcl.com email address, requesting that they confirm receipt of the report.

The email bounced, so I submitted a contact form via their website requesting immediate support and escalation to the security department.

As this was a Friday, I was not expecting a reply, but a few days passed by and MITRE did not reply either.

I double checked that the device was not covered by another Certificate Numbering Authority (CNA) and ended up working out, to my surprise, that TCL Corporation owns Alcatel.

In fact, they also own(ed) Blackberry Mobile.

Both of those brands are Open Handset Alliance members, and they are covered by the Google Android CNA.

So I resubmitted the report to the Android CNA.

A few more days passed and no reply from anyone yet.

Then I contacted a friend who put me in touch with a researcher, who had a contact of someone at the company. I emailed them.

Yet again, no reply.

I then publicly requested contact details of anyone at the TCL security team in this thread: https://community.disclose.io/t/looking-for-security-contact-at-tcl-corporation/39

Another researcher named John Jackson replied, and we connected on Twitter.

John had recently gone through a messy public disclosure with a company that threatened to sue him even though they had already stated, in writing, “the bug does not exist.”

This is where things get tough.

## Requests for Assistance

*John: I was browsing the disclose.io boards and saw Sick Codes’ post requesting assistance with disclosure for a major vulnerability that he found on TCL’s Smart TVs.*

*Seeing that he had attempted to contact the company through their phone support, contact forms, twitter, and email addresses – it was obvious that he wasn’t getting any response.*

*First and foremost, I replied on the board and connected with him on Twitter to validate the authenticity of the vulnerability.*

*It seemed like a legitimate issue, the Smart TV was exposing a random port and I could see a bunch of files on the client side. Working with Sick Codes, I dug a little deeper into the filesystem and noted that a lot of sensitive files could be accessed.*

*Nonetheless, not all of the sensitive files looked accessible and there were certain permission restrictions such as accessing the sensitive configuration files.*

*Turns out, a built-in directory existed on the TV and maintained root level permissions. The directory was nearly an identical clone of the exposed filesystem, and allowed us to circumvent any issues accessing various critical files*

*It was clear that utilizing this vulnerability could result in remote code execution or even quick network pivots with the intention of exploiting systems quickly with ransomware.*

*With a vast list of affected TV models enumerated from the exposed filesystem on the client-side, [or in other words millions of vulnerable TVs] I set out to help Sick Codes in the disclosure process.*

*Unfortunately, the result of my attempted disclosure was nearly identical to Sick Codes’, resulting in no response on Social Media or Email.*

*I called TCL and talked to a support representative. I urged her that we had a serious vulnerability on our hands and she stated that she had no contact info to the Security team, and didn’t even think/know if TCL had a Security team. She asked me if I wanted to disclose the vulnerability over the phone so that she could submit it into the ticketing system: I said no. It’s generally not the best practice to expose a highly sensitive vulnerability via a shared ticketed system.*

*Obviously, we had to approach other methodology so I contacted CERT to ask for assistance in disclosure. CERT did not respond to us initially.*

*Days later Sick Codes managed to acquire a name and point of contact at TCL. We reached out and after about a week, the company had acknowledged the vulnerability and stated that they would patch the issue. We asked for updates over the course of weeks, but they stopped responding to us. CERT finally responded and told us to disclose the vulnerability if that was the case.*

*Respectfully, John Jackson*

# Part 2: Backdoor Update Vulnerability – CVE-2020-28055

Sick Codes here again. It took 13 days for TCL Corporation to reply to our initial report.

Almost 2 weeks to confirm receipt of a security report, from the World’s 3rd largest TV manufacturer.

Second to that, but the TCL Security team actually confirmed in the same email, that they had fixed the vulnerability.

Serious questions must be raised at this point. Why did it take two weeks to reply, and how was it so easy to fix?

What Android service was stopped in the fix?

Will the TV function as expected without this overly permissive directory allowing anyone on the same network to download files on the TV?

It was at this time, I decided to try find some more vulnerabilities while we had the attention of the security team.

I went digging through .rc files looking for vendor specific changes.

Indeed, there were critical changes made by TCL to several folders on the TV file system that should be absolutely locked down.

In the file:

/system/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.rtd285o.rc

I found the following critical errors:

```
#tcl save data directory
mkdir /data/vendor/tcl 0777
#tcl oad data directory
mkdir /data/vendor/upgrade 0777
mkdir /var/TerminalManager 0777
```

This means that these folders are now writable, by all users on the file system.

/data/vendor/tcl contains critical files to operate the TV.

These files should not be writable by arbitrary users, or potentially malicious apps or APKs.

One can only guess what consequences having read & write access to the TCL updates folder might have…

Secondly, what I found in “TerminalManager\_Remote” was a little head-turning:

TerminalManager is an App, named TerminalManager\_Remote.apk

Unpacking the APK contains the following configuration file.

As much as I’d like to answer the big question here, I don’t know if I can.

I don’t have the answer. TCL does, however.

The TV that I conducted preliminary tests on was silently patched. No update warning was sent.

The fact that they were able to identify the vulnerability, and have patched it on their side automatically, without user input is also lightly striking.

Please make your own conclusions from our research.

If you want more research write-ups and investigations, then keep us both on Twitter.

   Please help!!! Everything I have read on this page is exactly what has been automatically installing on every 10 devices I own. I can not escape it and I feel so invaded. These hackers or whatever have complete control of all my devices and legit install fake apps and websites. Heck, this post probably won’t even go through. Everytime I look for help, it ends up being the hacker actually telling me how to hack instead of helping.

    <http://192.168.1.111:49153> (Philips 55PUS7503/12 Smart Android TV) gives only a “404 page not found” error. Tried to extend that address with Android directories and init.rc but they all gave a “404 page not found” error.

    <http://192.168.1.111:9080> gives “Status=OK” message but nothing else. Then there are few other ports that give an error message “didn’t send any data” when tried on a web browser.

      This means you are okay.

      `Status=OK` is some api that is used, health checking.

      If nothing showed /init.rc as 403 forbidden, then it’s most likely that you are not vulnerable.

    I am just starting to root around in my hisense 65″ qled android TV. I don’t recall the model number but it is a 2020 device. I have not found anything as egregious as what is described here, though I am still exploring the open ports I have found (which is what brought me here).

    To use an android TV safely in spite of its vulnerabilities, put it on its own VLAN and also put a VPN proxy on that VLAN. Direct the TV to use the VPN proxy as its gateway. On the upstream router, block all access to the VLAN from either direction, except for access required by the VPN proxy. Then, connect the TV to the VLAN using an ethernet connection. This likely will require you to use a trunking switch, but will lock your TV down completely.

    No inbound connections from anywhere will arrive at the TV; the VPN will prevent that because the external VPN server (the other end of your tunnel) will have no idea how to route any inbound traffic that is aimed at your TV, and the address of that remote server will show as the address of your TV. This prevents any remote control of the TV.

    I do this, and in addition I run a DNS server on my network (pihole) which is configured to block all the tracking that the TV tries to do.

      Roku TV’s are fine. We spoke to Roku and they are not vulnerable to this issue. This specifically affects TCL Android TVs.

      TCL Roku TVs are fine, even though they most likely come from the same factory.
