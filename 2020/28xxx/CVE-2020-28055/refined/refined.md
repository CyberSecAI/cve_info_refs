Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-28055:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2020-28055. The provided information matches the title and description related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the **incorrect permission assignment** to three critical vendor resource directories within the TCL Android Smart TV file system. Specifically, the following directories are made world-writable (0777):

   *  `/data/vendor/tcl`
   *  `/data/vendor/upgrade`
   *  `/var/TerminalManager`

These permissions are set by the vendor's `rc` file (`/system/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.rtd285o.rc`).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   * **World-Writable Directories:** The primary weakness is that the specified directories are world-writable, meaning that any user on the system, including unprivileged users or malicious applications, can read, modify, and delete files within these directories.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By modifying files in `/data/vendor/upgrade` directory, an attacker can potentially force the TV to execute arbitrary code through malicious vendor system upgrades.
    * **System Resource Modification:**  The ability to modify files within `/data/vendor/tcl` and `/var/TerminalManager` also allows modification of critical system resources that could lead to a denial of service, or other system instability.
  *  **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive data in these directories.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   *   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local. A malicious application installed on the TV can exploit this vulnerability.
   *   The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious actor installing an APK on the target TV.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the TV's file system. This can be achieved by:
     *   Installing a malicious application (APK) on the TV.
    *  Gaining shell access on the target TV.
   *   **Unprivileged Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unprivileged user, meaning an attacker doesn't need root access to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides more details than the official CVE description, particularly around the specific directories and the method used to set the permissions.
* The information includes versions affected and vendor mitigation advice, and also highlights the lack of vendor response.
*  It mentions that the affected TVs are vulnerable "out of the box," indicating the issue is present in the default firmware configuration.
* The content also details an associated vulnerability (CVE-2020-27403) which involves exposing the entire filesystem over http which aids an attacker in exploring the system to prepare to exploit CVE-2020-28055.
* The content discusses the problematic `/var/TerminalManager` path, and the included configuration of a netcwmp service, which could allow even further control of the TV by an attacker.
* The mitigation section states that without root access, the permissions cannot be changed manually.
* The content shows a comment from a user claiming to be hacked.
