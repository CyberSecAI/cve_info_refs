Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-28628:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when parsing Nef polygon data in CGAL. Specifically, during the `read_volume()` function of the `SNC_io_parser` class, a vector index is read from the input and used to access the `SEdge_of` vector, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code reads an integer from the input, uses it as an index into a vector (`SEdge_of`), without validating if this index is within the bounds of the vector.
- **Type confusion:** By providing a crafted index, an attacker can cause the program to read from arbitrary memory locations, leading to type confusion and potentially code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code execution:**  Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution. The out-of-bounds read and type confusion can be leveraged to overwrite critical memory locations, redirect control flow, and ultimately execute attacker-controlled code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious input file:** An attacker provides a specially crafted malformed `.nef` file as input to CGAL. This file contains crafted indices that will lead to out-of-bounds memory access when parsed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.nef` file to an application that uses the vulnerable CGAL library.
- No specific position or privilege is required other than the ability to supply the malicious input file to the vulnerable process.

**Specific Vulnerable Code:**
```c++
template <typename EW>
template <typename K>
bool SNC_io_parser<EW>::
read_sedge(SHalfedge_handle seh) {

  bool OK = true;
  int index;

  in >> index;
  OK = OK && test_string("{");

  in >> index;
  seh->twin() = SEdge_of[index]; // Vulnerable line, oob read
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information indicates that a large number of vulnerabilities exist within the Nef polygon parsing functionality of CGAL, all with similar causes of unchecked indices leading to out-of-bounds reads.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of CGAL prior to 5.4.1.
- The Talos report provides a very detailed breakdown of each specific vulnerability within the parser.
