Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28433:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `node-latex-pdf` package is vulnerable to command injection. This occurs because the package executes a shell command using user-supplied input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into a command that is then executed by the operating system shell. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** There is a potential for some loss of confidentiality, where an attacker can gain access to restricted information, although the control over the information obtained might be limited.
- **Integrity:** Modification of data is possible, but the attacker may have limited control over the extent of the modification.
- **Availability:** The attacker could reduce performance or interrupt resource availability, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability over a network.
- **User-Supplied Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing crafted input to the `node-latex-pdf` package. Specifically, this is done by providing malicious input to the directory path when calling the function of the package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the function that executes the shell command.
- The attacker does not require any privileges, and user interaction is not needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided:
    ```javascript
    var a = require("node-latex-pdf");
    a("./", "& touch JHU", function(){})
    ```
    This code snippet shows how to inject the `touch JHU` command, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary system commands.
- The Snyk analysis notes that the attack vector is "Network", the attack complexity is "Low", and no privileges or user interaction are needed. The CVSS v3.1 score from Snyk is 7.3 (High) and from NVD is 9.8 (Critical), with low scores for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability as described in the CVSS section.

**Additional Information:**
- There is no fixed version for the `node-latex-pdf` package.
- The vulnerability was disclosed on 11 Dec 2020 and published on 21 Jan 2021, credited to JHU System Security Lab.
