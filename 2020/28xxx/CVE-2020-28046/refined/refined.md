Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary root cause of this privilege escalation vulnerability lies in the use of a vulnerable version of `xtables-multi`, a utility used for managing firewall rules (iptables/ip6tables).  Specifically, the vulnerability is not directly within `xtables-multi` itself but in how it interacts with the kernel via the `--modprobe` option combined with a missing `/proc/net/ip6_tables_names` file. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by specifying a path to a malicious shared library in the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable, which `xtables-multi` executes as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Vulnerable `xtables-multi`**: The `xtables-multi` binary is based on an old version (1.4.21) which contains known vulnerabilities.  Specifically, while the writeup mentions potential buffer overflows related to `iptables-restore`, the primary exploit vector uses the `--modprobe` parameter.
2.  **Missing `/proc/net/ip6_tables_names`**: The vulnerability relies on the fact that the file `/proc/net/ip6_tables_names` does not exist on the system.  This causes `ip6tables` to attempt to load a module via `modprobe`.
3.  **Unrestricted `--modprobe` execution:** The `--modprobe` option allows execution of arbitrary commands or scripts, when a missing module is targeted.
4.  **Writable Shared Libraries:** User applications' libraries are writable by the same low-privilege user, which allows the attacker to replace them with malicious libraries.
5.  **Missing Protections:**  No specific security measures, such as ASLR or other mitigations, are mentioned, except for the NX bit, which further facilitates exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to immediate root privileges. A low-privilege user can execute arbitrary code with root permissions.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can gain full control of the affected system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability. The attacker must have some level of shell access to the device, which could be obtained via the debug interface, or through a previously exploited vulnerability.
*   **`xtables-multi` Command:** The attacker leverages the vulnerable `ip6tables` command with the `--modprobe` option to trigger the arbitrary code execution.
*   **Shared Library Replacement:** A malicious shared object is created, compiled, and placed in the system, replacing a user application's library. This library is then loaded when the application is executed, providing root privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker must have a low-privilege user account with shell access to the device.
*   **File Write Access:**  The attacker needs write access to replace shared libraries of installed apps (or to write a library that can be used with `LD_PRELOAD`).
*   **Understanding of the system**: The attacker must have some knowledge of the system, including knowledge on shared libraries, and the usage of `xtables-multi`.
