  "CVE-2020-28856": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The application does not correctly determine the HTTP request's originating IP address, allowing attackers to spoof it using X-Forwarded-For directive in the header, effectively bypassing IP-based access controls.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application relies on the X-Forwarded-For header to determine the client's IP address instead of directly checking the source IP of the incoming request.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "IP address spoofing",
        "IP access control bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can bypass IP-based access controls configured for the software, potentially gaining access to restricted endpoints or sensitive data.",
       "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending an HTTP request with a crafted 'X-Forwarded-For' header"
        ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application. They do not need access to the internal network, but can specify 'localhost' to bypass all IP-based restrictions."
