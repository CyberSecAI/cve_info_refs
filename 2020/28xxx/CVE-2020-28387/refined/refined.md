- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly restrict external entities when parsing a specially crafted SEECTCXML file, allowing the underlying XML parser to disclose arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of arbitrary files to remote attackers.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted SEECTCXML file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide the specially crafted file to the user of the affected application. The user needs to open the malicious file.
