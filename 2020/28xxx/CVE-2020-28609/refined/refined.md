Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper bounds checking on integer indices read from a file when parsing Nef polygon data in the CGAL library. Specifically, the `read_face` function in `Nef_2/PM_io_parser.h` reads an integer `vi` and uses it as an index into the `Vertex_of` vector without any validation, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129):** The code directly uses the read index to access a vector, without checking if the index is within the valid range of the vector's bounds. This leads to out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds read, causing the program to access memory locations outside the allocated vector. This can lead to:
    - **Type Confusion:** By reading from arbitrary memory locations, an attacker can cause type confusion which can ultimately lead to code execution
    - **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application to crash due to a segmentation fault or similar memory access violation.
    - **Code Execution:** The type confusion resulting from out of bounds read can lead to code execution

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input File:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted `.nef3` file that contains malicious index values that are out of bounds to the program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious input file to a program that uses the vulnerable CGAL library to parse Nef polygon data, without proper input validation

**Specific Details for CVE-2020-28609:**

- **Affected Function:** `PM_io_parser::read_face()`
- **Vulnerable Code:**
```c++
  while (in >> vi) {
    CGAL_assertion_msg(vi >= 0 && (std::size_t) vi < vn, "wrong index in iso vertex list.");
    f->store_iv(Vertex_of[vi]);
  }
```
- The vulnerability lies in the fact that `CGAL_assertion_msg` does not halt execution if the condition is not met, and therefore an out of bound access `Vertex_of[vi]` can still occur

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-28609 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the CGAL library's Nef polygon parsing code. By providing a crafted input file with malicious indices, an attacker can force the program to read from arbitrary memory locations, leading to type confusion, denial of service, or potentially code execution.
