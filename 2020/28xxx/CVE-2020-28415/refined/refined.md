Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-28415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This means the application takes user-supplied data from the request, and includes it in the HTML response without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application does not sanitize user inputs that are reflected in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML code execution: A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML code within the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL: The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes malicious HTML code. When the victim clicks this URL, the vulnerable application reflects this code back, and executes in the victim's browser context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker. The attacker does not require prior access to the system, and can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending the crafted URL to the victim.
