Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload in the Theme upload functionality of HorizontCMS. The system allows users to upload a ZIP archive, which is then extracted to the `/themes/` directory without proper validation of the files within the archive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application lacks proper validation on uploaded files, specifically ZIP archives. It does not check for dangerous file types within the archive.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The extraction of the ZIP archive to the `/themes/` directory allows for writing files to arbitrary locations within the web server's file system (specifically the themes directory)
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The uploaded zip file is not sanitized allowing for malicious php scripts to be uploaded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a ZIP file containing a PHP shell, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker can gain full control over the web server by simply accessing the uploaded shell file (e.g. http://<IP>/themes/shell.php).

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface's theme upload function.
*   **Malicious Zip File:** The attacker creates a ZIP archive containing a malicious PHP file, which is then uploaded through the application's theme upload feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be logged in as an administrator or a user with theme modification privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the HorizontCMS application's web interface.
