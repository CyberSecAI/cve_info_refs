The provided content describes CVE-2020-28695.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user input in the Askey Fiber Router's Admin Dashboard tools (Ping, DNS Lookup, Traceroute). This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in shell commands, leading to command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router.
- Full system compromise: RCE can lead to complete control over the device.
- Data theft: Attackers can steal sensitive data, including admin credentials.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can change router settings, block internet access, or reboot the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: The attacker must be connected to the router's network (Wi-Fi or wired).
- Web interface: The vulnerability is exploited through the router's Admin Dashboard.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the router (same local network).
- Basic understanding of command injection techniques.
