- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OSPF protocol implementation in affected devices incorrectly handles the number of LSA fields in combination with other modified fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of LSA fields in OSPF packets, leading to a denial-of-service. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to incorrect calculation of LSA fields within the OSPF implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can create a permanent denial-of-service condition on affected devices.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted OSPF packets to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. Successful exploitation requires OSPF to be enabled on the affected device.
