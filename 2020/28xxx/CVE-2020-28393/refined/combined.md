SUMMARY

SCALANCE XM-400 and XR-500 devices contain a vulnerability in the OSPF protocol implementation
that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a permanent denial-of-service condition.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable OSPF in the layer 3 conﬁguration menu (note that OSPF is disabled by default). The

vulnerability is not exploitable, when OSPF is disabled.

• If OSPF is used, set a password for the OSPF interface and enable MD5 authentication

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28393

The OSPF protocol implementation in affected devices incorrectly handles the number of LSA ﬁelds in
combination with other modiﬁed ﬁelds.

An unauthenticated remote attacker could create a permanent denial-of-service condition by sending
specially crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation requires OSPF to be enabled on an affected
device.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

All SCALANCE XM-400 and XR-500 devices are affected, including those who do not support layer 3
routing and OSPF natively, as the activation of these features is possible via the KEY-PLUG modules:

• KEY-PLUG for XM-400: https://mall.industry.siemens.com/mall/en/de/Catalog/Product/6GK5904-

0PA00

• KEY-PLUG for XR-500: https://mall.industry.siemens.com/mall/en/de/Catalog/Product/6GK5905-

0PA00

As long as layer 3 routing including OSPF is not enabled, the vulnerability is not exploitable.
