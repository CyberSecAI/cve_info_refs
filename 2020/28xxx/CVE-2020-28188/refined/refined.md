Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28188:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `event` parameter within the `makecvs.php` page (`/include/makecvs.php`) of TerraMaster TOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the vulnerable server.
*   **Complete System Control:** Gaining the ability to execute commands allows an attacker to take full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page (`/include/makecvs.php`).
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable TerraMaster TOS server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any valid user credentials for the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects TerraMaster TOS versions prior to 4.2.06.
*   The Check Point Research article details how this vulnerability was exploited as part of the "FreakOut" botnet campaign.
*   The IHTeam blog post provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability, also noting a similar vulnerability in `ajax/logtable.php` that requires authentication.
*   An exploit for this vulnerability was publicly available at: `https://iht.li/paste.php?hash=UEUS` (from the IHTeam article)
* The Check Point Research article showed the attacker uses the RCE vulnerability to download and execute a python script (out.py) which is used to further create a botnet.
* The IHTeam article notes that CVE-2020-35665 is a duplicate of CVE-2020-28188.
