# Object Injection Vulnerability in Welcart e-Commerce Plugin

On October 6, 2020, our Threat Intelligence team discovered a High-Severity Object Injection vulnerability in [Welcart e-Commerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/usc-e-shop/), a WordPress plugin with over 20,000 installations that claims top market share in Japan.

After we finished our investigation, we contacted the plugin’s publisher, Collne Inc. on October 9, 2020. Full disclosure was sent on October 12, 2020, and the plugin was patched in version 1.9.36 on October 20, 2020.

Wordfence Premium customers received a firewall rule protecting against this vulnerability on October 9, 2020. Sites still using the free version of Wordfence will receive this rule after 30 days on November 8, 2020.

**Description:** PHP Object Injection

**Affected Products:** [Welcart e-Commerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/usc-e-shop/)

**Plugin slug:** usc-e-shop

**Affected Versions:** < 1.9.36

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-28339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28339)

**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)

**CVSS Vector:**[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 1.9.36

Welcart e-Commerce is a WordPress plugin that can be used to create an online store with a separate customer account area. It uses its own cookies, separate from the ones used by WordPress, in order to track user sessions. Every request to the site results in the `usces_cookie` being parsed by the `get_cookie` function. This function used `usces_unserialize` to decode the contents of this cookie.

```
	function get_cookie($key='usces_cookie') {
		$values = isset($_COOKIE[$key]) ? usces_unserialize(stripslashes($_COOKIE[$key])) : NULL;
		return $values;
	}
```
```
function usces_unserialize( $data ) {
	if( is_serialized( $data ) ) {
		return @unserialize( $data );
	}
	if( is_array( $data ) ) {
		return $data;
	}
	return @json_decode( $data, true );
}
```

Unfortunately, this meant that an attacker could send a request with the `usces_cookie` parameter set to a specially crafted string which, once unserialized, would inject a PHP object.

PHP Object injections require a vulnerable magic method to be present in order to fully exploit what’s known as a POP chain. We’ve mentioned POP chains before in a [previous article](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/08/newsletter-plugin-vulnerabilities-affect-over-300000-sites/#how-does-php-object-injection-work). A POP chain allows an attacker to make use of what are known as magic methods in order to obtain remote code execution, delete arbitrary files, or perform other actions that could allow them to take over a site.

This plugin included a library, tcpdf, that contains a `__destruct` magic method that could have been used to create a POP chain under other circumstances. Fortunately, a complete POP chain was not present because the plugin unserialized the cookie before the `TCPDF` class was loaded and defined, so it was not possible to inject an object with this class.

In more good news, this vulnerability could not be exploited in conjunction with the [recently patched issue](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/11/unpacking-the-wordpress-5-5-2-5-5-3-security-release/) in the WordPress core’s `Requests_Utility_FilteredIterator` class, since the `usces_unserialize` function used the `is_serialized` function to decide whether to unserialize the cookie data and attacks against `Requests_Utility_FilteredIterator` failed this check.

## Timeline

**October 6, 2020** – Our Threat Intelligence team discovers a PHP Object Injection vulnerability in Welcart e-Commerce.

**October 9, 2020** – Our Threat Intelligence team finishes analyzing the vulnerability and contacts the plugin’s publisher. A firewall rule is released for Wordfence Premium users.

**October 12, 2020** – We send the full disclosure to the plugin’s publisher.

**October 20, 2020** – A sufficient patch for Welcart e-Commerce is released.

**November 8, 2020** – The Wordfence Firewall rule becomes available to sites running the free version of Wordfence.

## Conclusion

In today’s article, we detailed a PHP Object in the Welcart e-Commerce plugin. [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20201105&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) users have been protected against this vulnerability since October 9, 2020. Sites still running the free version of Wordfence receive the firewall rule on November 8, 2020.

We highly recommend updating to the latest version, 1.9.36 as of this writing, as soon as possible. If someone you know is using Welcart e-Commerce, we recommend sharing this advisory with them so they can take necessary action to protect their site.

## Description

Welcart is a free e-commerce plugin for WordPress with top market share in Japan.

Welcart comes with many features and customizations for making an online store.

You can easily create your own original online store.

#### SHOPPING CART SYSTEM

You can sell any type of product (physical, digital, subscriptions).

There is no limit to the number of products, item photos, and categories.

You can manage items by SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) code.

Welcart has many options for pricing and shipping.

You can apply for up to 16 different payment options (Sony Payment, Paypal, Softbank Payment etc.) on Welcart’s official website.

Please refer to the link below (Japanese version).

[Welcart Payment services(Japanese)](https://www.welcart.com/wc-settlement/)

#### DESIGN

Welcart has free standard templates and themes.

You can customize the design and layout any way you like.

All themes are compliant to WordPress standards.

Welcart provides a free responsive design theme (Welcart Basic), from the link below.

[Welcart Theme downloads(Japanese)](https://www.welcart.com/archives/category/item/itemgenre/template/)

#### MANAGING SYSTEM

Order data is automatically stored and updated in the database.

Welcart has a highly functional “order list” page, for viewing and updating orders.

You can narrow your search results by customer information, price, date, item type, etc.

You can also easily manage an order directly through its edit page, where you can edit order details, confirm the purchase, send confirmation emails, and much more.

#### MEMBERSHIP SYSTEM

Welcart has it’s very own membership system, eliminating the need for any extra plugins.

Similar to the order list page, a highly functional member list page is also provided.

You can search for member data by customer information, purchase history, etc.

Member orders can be edited individually.

You can also enable a point system for Welcart members.
