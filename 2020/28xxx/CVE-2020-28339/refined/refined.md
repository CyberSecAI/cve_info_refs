  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-28339",
      "root_cause": "The Welcart e-Commerce plugin's `get_cookie` function uses `usces_unserialize` to decode the contents of the `usces_cookie`. The `usces_unserialize` function uses `unserialize` on the data without sufficient sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "PHP Object Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could send a request with a crafted `usces_cookie` parameter, injecting a PHP object when unserialized. Although a full POP chain was not present to achieve remote code execution, the vulnerability could potentially be exploited in other circumstances, such as if a vulnerable class with a magic method were present.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a malicious request with a crafted `usces_cookie` parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server."
      ],
	   "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was mitigated because the plugin unserialized the cookie before the `TCPDF` class was loaded and defined, and attacks against `Requests_Utility_FilteredIterator` failed the `is_serialized` check. This prevented the exploitation of the `__destruct` magic method within `tcpdf` library or other potential exploits. The vulnerability is rated as High Severity with a CVSS score of 7.5."
