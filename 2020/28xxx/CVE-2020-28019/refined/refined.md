{
  "CVE-2020-28019": {
    "root cause": "Failure to reset function pointer after BDAT error.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Exim fails to reset the `receive_getc` function pointer after a BDAT command fails, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
      "When a mail exceeds `message_size_limit`, `receive_getc` remains set to `bdat_getc` instead of being reset to its original value (`lwr_receive_getc`)."
    ],
    "impact": "When a subsequent BDAT command is received, the code can cause a recursive loop in `bdat_getc`, resulting in a stack exhaustion and denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending an oversized mail using the BDAT command.",
       "By sending a sequence of oversized BDAT messages, the attacker can cause a recursive call to `bdat_getc`."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote, capable of sending SMTP commands to the Exim server."
