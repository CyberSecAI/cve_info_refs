Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-28578, CVE-2020-28579, CVE-2020-28580, and CVE-2020-28581:

**CVE-2020-28578: Unauthenticated Remote Stack Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation of user-supplied data within the `Java_com_trend_iwss_gui_IWSSJNI_DecryptPasswd` function in `libuiauutil.so`. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy data to a fixed-size stack-based buffer without checking the size, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the `iscan` account.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the `/rest/windows_client_status` URL on HTTPS port 8443.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required. The attacker can remotely trigger this vulnerability.

**CVE-2020-28579: Authenticated Remote Stack Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation of user-supplied data in the `MailNotification` function within `libuiauutil.so`. The `strcat` function is used to concatenate data to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking, resulting in a buffer overflow.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the `iscan` account.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the `/urlf_reclassifyurl.jsp` URL on HTTPS port 8443.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user account with report access and a valid CSRFGuardToken.

**CVE-2020-28580: Authenticated Command Injection in AddVLANItem**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper validation of user-supplied data within the `Java_com_trend_iwss_gui_IWSSJNI_AddVLANItem` function in `libuiauutil.so`. The function passes unsanitized input to a system shell, allowing command injection.
*   **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary OS command execution with the privileges of the `iscan` account.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the `/servlet/com.trend.iwss.gui.servlet.ManageVLANSettings` URL on HTTPS port 8443.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user account with high privileges and a valid CSRFGuardToken.

**CVE-2020-28581: Authenticated Command Injection in ModifyVLANItem**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to CVE-2020-28580, this vulnerability lies in the  `Java_com_trend_iwss_gui_IWSSJNI_ModifyVLANItem` function within `libuiauutil.so`. The function passes unsanitized input to a system shell, allowing command injection.
*  **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary OS command execution with the privileges of the `iscan` account.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the `/servlet/com.trend.iwss.gui.servlet.ManageVLANSettings` URL on HTTPS port 8443.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user account with high privileges and a valid CSRFGuardToken.

**Summary of commonalities:**

*   All vulnerabilities are found within the Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) 6.5 Service Pack 2, build 1901.
*   Exploitation often involves sending specially crafted HTTP messages to specific URLs on the appliance via HTTPS port 8443.
*   The vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute code with the privileges of the `iscan` user.
*   The root cause of all the issues is improper validation of user-supplied data.

**Additional Information**

*   Trend Micro has released a critical patch (CP) to address these vulnerabilities.
*   Tenable assigned the advisory ID TRA-2020-63 for these vulnerabilities.
