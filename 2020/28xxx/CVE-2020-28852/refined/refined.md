Based on the provided information:

**CVE-2020-28852**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is in the `language.ParseAcceptLanguage` function of the `golang.org/x/text` package when processing BCP47 language tags. Specifically, a crafted input string can cause a slice bounds out of range panic. This occurs due to an issue in the `scanner.resizeRange` function during parsing of language extensions within the BCP47 tag.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a slice bounds out of range error, leading to a panic within the Go runtime. This stems from incorrect handling of index calculations when parsing extensions of BCP47 language tags.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS). The application using the vulnerable function will crash due to the panic.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted string representing a BCP47 language tag, passed to the vulnerable `language.ParseAcceptLanguage` function.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide the maliciously crafted BCP47 language tag string to the application using the vulnerable `language.ParseAcceptLanguage` function. This typically involves control over the Accept-Language header in HTTP requests or other user-controlled input used by the vulnerable code.
