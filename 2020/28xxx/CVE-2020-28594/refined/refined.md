- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free in the `_3MF_Importer::_handle_end_model()` function due to incorrect handling of object deletion within the `m_objects` map and `m_model->objects` vector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code iterates through a map (`m_objects`) containing object IDs and their order of appearance, using this order to access elements in a vector (`m_model->objects`).  When objects are deleted within the loop, the vector's size changes, but the map is not updated. This leads to out-of-bounds access in the vector when the loop continues to iterate using the stale index, which may cause a double-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can cause a use-after-free condition, potentially leading to code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted 3MF file with specific object IDs and structure can trigger the vulnerability when parsed by PrusaSlicer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious 3MF file to the vulnerable application. User interaction is required to open the malicious file in PrusaSlicer.
