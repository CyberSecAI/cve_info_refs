{
  "CVE-2020-28272": {
    "Description": "Prototype pollution vulnerability in 'keyget' versions 1.0.0 through 2.2.0 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The `setByPath()` function in the `keyget` npm module does not properly validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property. Specifically, it lacks a check to ensure the property being modified is the object's own property and not a prototype property.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution",
      "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can create non-existent properties or manipulate existing ones on the Object prototype. This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE). By polluting the prototype, an attacker can modify the behavior of all objects in the application.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability is triggered through a network attack vector by supplying malicious values to the `setByPath()` function of the 'keyget' library, specifically manipulating the 'path' parameter to include '__proto__'.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs to be able to supply malicious input to the vulnerable function.",
    "Affected environments": "Versions 1.0.1 through 2.2.0 of the `keyget` npm module.",
    "Fix": "Upgrade to version 2.3.0 of the `keyget` npm module, where the vulnerability is patched by adding validation for the property being set.",
     "PoC": "```\nvar keyget = require(\"keyget\")\nkeyget.set({}, '__proto__.polluted', 'true');\nconsole.log(polluted);\n```"
  }
