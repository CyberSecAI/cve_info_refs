    "cvss_score": 8.1,
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the flawed verification routine of the doCheckPassword method, where it checks for an index of characters instead of matching characters at corresponding positions. This means that a password can be considered valid even if the byte-for-byte match is not exact. The vulnerability is quite insidious as it can create the impression the code is working. It is not and any usage of OpenBSDBCrypt.checkPassword() for BC 1.65 or BC 1.66 needs to be removed.",
  "workaround": "If you have to use either BC 1.65 or BC 1.66 and you need to do password checking for OpenBSDBcrypt, use the code given in the doCheckPassword() method in the provided link. It's a static method - the code can be copied into your own utility class without issue."
