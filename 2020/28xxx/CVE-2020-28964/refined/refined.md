- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack buffer overflows due to insufficient input validation in two functionalities of Internet Download Manager v6.37.11.1.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack buffer overflow in the `search` function of the downloads menu. The search function does not impose length restrictions on the search input, allowing attackers to overwrite registers.
    - Stack buffer overflow in the `Export/Import` function of the tasks menu. Importing manipulated *.ef2 files with excessively long referer and source URLs can overwrite the EIP register due to insufficient validation of the ef2 file type.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Overwriting registers to elevate local process privileges, leading to a compromise of the local computer or file system.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local attackers with access to the software can trigger the `search` function overflow by injecting a large unicode payload into the search input field.
    - Local attackers can exploit the `Export/Import` function overflow by importing a specially crafted *.ef2 file with manipulated referer and source URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Requires local access to the vulnerable software, running under restricted or low privilege user account. No user interaction required to trigger the exploit.
