The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28103.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `page_del` function in `cscms4.1\plugins\sys\admin\label.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter passed to the function via `GET` or `POST` method. The `id` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without sanitization/parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `page_del` function.
- The `$id` parameter, which is retrieved from the user input through `get_post`, is directly used within a SQL query.
- Vulnerable code lines:
 ```php
  $row=$this->db->query("SELECT sid,url FROM ".CS_SqlPrefix."page where id='".$id."'")->row();
 ```
**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform time-based SQL injection.
- Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can send a crafted `id` parameter via a `GET` or `POST` request to `label.php?ac=page_del`.
- The `id` parameter will contain SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `label.php` endpoint.
- The attacker must be able to modify the `id` parameter value to include a SQL injection payload.
