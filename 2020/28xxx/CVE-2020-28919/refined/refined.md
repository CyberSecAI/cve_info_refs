Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28919:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Checkmk GUI used a flawed approach to handle HTML. It would encode user input using HTML entities, then selectively decode certain tags, specifically `<a>` tags, including their `href` attribute. The `href` attribute was not validated for its protocol allowing javascript URLs, such as `javascript:alert(1)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the view title, which is then stored and displayed to other users.
- **Inadequate input sanitization:** The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the view title, specifically the `href` attribute of `<a>` tags.
- **Insufficient protocol validation:** The application did not validate the protocol of the URLs in the `href` attribute, allowing the use of `javascript:` URLs, which can execute arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to:
    - **Confidential data theft:** Accessing sensitive user data.
    - **UI redressing (clickjacking):** Manipulating the user interface to trick users into performing unintended actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "title" field when configuring a custom view.
- An authenticated attacker with permission to configure and share a custom view can inject malicious HTML, specifically an `<a>` tag with a `javascript:` URL in the title field.
- When other users view the configured view, the JavaScript code will be executed if they click on the crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the Checkmk application.
- The attacker needs to have permissions to configure and share custom views.
- The attacker must trick a user into clicking on the injected link.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was present in Checkmk versions 1.6.0p18 and earlier.
- The fix was implemented in Checkmk versions 1.6.0p19 and 2.0.0i1.
- The fix involves parsing the URL in the `href` attribute and validating its scheme against an allowlist (only allowing "http" and "https" protocols).
- The vulnerability exists in the `cmk/gui/htmllib.py:Escaper` component of Checkmk.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.4 (Medium).
