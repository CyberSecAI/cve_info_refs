# Introduction

## Problem description:

Exim4 in at least the variant *exim4-daemon-light*
on Debian Jessie, is started as root but switches to uid/gid
Debian-exim/Debian-exim. But as Exim might need to store received
messages in user mailboxes, it has to have the ability to regain
privileges. This is also true when Exim is started as *sendmail*.
During internal operation, sendmail (Exim) will manipulate message
spool files in directory structures owned by user *Debian-exim*
without caring about symlink attacks. Thus execution of code as
user *Debian-exim* can be used to gain root privileges by
invoking sendmail as user *Debian-exim*.

# Methods

To gain root privileges, creation of a dual-use binary was
attempted, so that the binary can both be a normal command line
executable but also work as a replacement for libpam, the target
for escation. Escalation procedure is as follows:

* Get current properties of */lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0.83.1*
  for restoration later on
* Fork a *sendmail* instance to deliver an empty message
* Wait for appearance of a */var/spool/exim4/msglog/xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xx*
  file
* Symlink */var/spool/exim4/input/xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xx-J* to
  */lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0.83.1* on Debian Jessie
* Wait for *libpam.so.0.83.1* to change ownership
* Preserve content of *libpam.so.0.83.1*
* Replace *libpam.so.0.83.1* with content of exploit binary
* Start */bin/su* to load shared library, make exploit
  binary also a SUID binary
* Restore *libpam.so.0.83.1* and attributes
* Invoke exploit to start root shell

The steps from above were all added to <EximUpgrade.c> for demonstration.

# ...

# Results, Discussion

As Exim4 process itself is already quite privileged - it has
to access the user mailboxes with different UIDs anyway - the
having such problems is expectable and explainable. A change in
documentation might make sense, to indicate, that the special
user "Debian-exim" is only intended to mark files being used by
the daemon, but not to provide root/daemon user privilege separation.

Even without this vulnerability, a "Debian-exim" process could
use the [SetgidDirectoryPrivilegeEscalation](../../2015/SetgidDirectoryPrivilegeEscalation/)
to escalate to "adm" group, which again makes it very likely to
use "syslog", "apache" or other components to escalate to root
via "/var/log".

Timeline
========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
We recently audited central parts of the Exim mail server
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim) and discovered 21 vulnerabilities
(from CVE-2020-28007 to CVE-2020-28026, plus CVE-2021-27216): 11 local
vulnerabilities, and 10 remote vulnerabilities. Unless otherwise noted,
all versions of Exim are affected since at least the beginning of its
Git history, in 2004.
We have not tried to exploit all of these vulnerabilities, but we
successfully exploited 4 LPEs (Local Privilege Escalations) and 3 RCEs
(Remote Code Executions):
- CVE-2020-28007 (LPE, from user "exim" to root);
- CVE-2020-28008 (LPE, from user "exim" to root);
- CVE-2020-28015 (LPE, from any user to root);
- CVE-2020-28012 (LPE, from any user to root, if allow\_filter is true);
- CVE-2020-28020 (unauthenticated RCE as "exim", in Exim < 4.92);
- CVE-2020-28018 (unauthenticated RCE as "exim", in 4.90 <= Exim < 4.94,
if TLS encryption is provided by OpenSSL);
- CVE-2020-28021 (authenticated RCE, as root);
- CVE-2020-28017 is also exploitable (unauthenticated RCE as "exim"),
but requires more than 25GB of memory in the default configuration.
We will not publish our exploits for now; instead, we encourage other
security researchers to write and publish their own exploits:
- This advisory contains sufficient information to develop reliable
exploits for these vulnerabilities; in fact, we believe that better
exploitation methods exist.
- We hope that more security researchers will look into Exim's code and
report their findings; indeed, we discovered several of these
vulnerabilities while working on our exploits.
- We will answer (to the best of our abilities) any questions regarding
these vulnerabilities and exploits on the public "oss-security" list
(https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security).
Last-minute note: as explained in the Timeline, we developed a minimal
set of patches for these vulnerabilities; for reference and comparison,
it is attached to this advisory and is also available at
https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/.
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28007: Link attack in Exim's log directory
========================================================================
The Exim binary is set-user-ID-root, and Exim operates as root in its
log directory, which belongs to the "exim" user:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxr-s--- 2 Debian-exim adm 4096 Nov 4 06:16 /var/log/exim4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user (by
exploiting CVE-2020-28020 or CVE-2020-28018 for example) can exploit
this local vulnerability to obtain full root privileges. Indeed, the
following code opens a log file in append mode, as root (lines 465-469):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
22 static uschar \*log\_names[] = { US"main", US"reject", US"panic", US"debug" };
...
382 static void
383 open\_log(int \*fd, int type, uschar \*tag)
384 {
...
387 uschar buffer[LOG\_NAME\_SIZE];
...
398 ok = string\_format(buffer, sizeof(buffer), CS file\_path, log\_names[type]);
...
465 \*fd = Uopen(buffer,
466 #ifdef O\_CLOEXEC
467 O\_CLOEXEC |
468 #endif
469 O\_APPEND|O\_WRONLY, LOG\_MODE);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The name of the log file in buffer is derived from file\_path, which is
derived from log\_file\_path, a format string defined at compile time (or
re-defined by the configuration file). On Debian, log\_file\_path is
"/var/log/exim4/%slog", and "%s" is converted to "main", "reject",
"panic", or "debug" at run time (line 398).
An attacker with the privileges of the "exim" user can create a symlink
(or a hardlink) in the log directory, append arbitrary contents to an
arbitrary file (to /etc/passwd, for example), and obtain full root
privileges:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=107(Debian-exim) gid=114(Debian-exim) groups=114(Debian-exim)
cd /var/log/exim4
ln -s -f /etc/passwd paniclog

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28008: Assorted attacks in Exim's spool directory
========================================================================
Exim also operates as root in its spool directory, which belongs to the
"exim" user:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxr-x--- 5 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov 4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4
drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov 4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/db
drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov 4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/input
drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov 4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/msglog
------------------------------------------------------------------------
An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user can exploit
this local vulnerability to obtain full root privileges. Various attack
vectors exist:
- The attacker can directly write to a spool header file (in the "input"
subdirectory) and reuse our exploitation technique for CVE-2020-28015.
- The attacker can create a long-named file in the "db" subdirectory and
overflow a stack-based buffer (at line 208):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
87 open\_db \*
88 dbfn\_open(uschar \*name, int flags, open\_db \*dbblock, BOOL lof)
89 {
..
94 uschar dirname[256], filename[256];
...
111 snprintf(CS dirname, sizeof(dirname), "%s/db", spool\_directory);
112 snprintf(CS filename, sizeof(filename), "%s/%s.lockfile", dirname, name);
...
198 uschar \*lastname = Ustrrchr(filename, '/') + 1;
199 int namelen = Ustrlen(name);
200
201 \*lastname = 0;
202 dd = opendir(CS filename);
203
204 while ((ent = readdir(dd)))
205 if (Ustrncmp(ent->d\_name, name, namelen) == 0)
206 {
207 struct stat statbuf;
208 Ustrcpy(lastname, ent->d\_name);

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The attacker can create a symlink (or a hardlink) in the "db"
subdirectory and take ownership of an arbitrary file (at line 212):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
204 while ((ent = readdir(dd)))
205 if (Ustrncmp(ent->d\_name, name, namelen) == 0)
206 {
207 struct stat statbuf;
208 Ustrcpy(lastname, ent->d\_name);
209 if (Ustat(filename, &statbuf) >= 0 && statbuf.st\_uid != exim\_uid)
210 {
211 DEBUG(D\_hints\_lookup) debug\_printf\_indent("ensuring %s is owned by exim\n", filename);
212 if (Uchown(filename, exim\_uid, exim\_gid))

Side note: CVE-2020-28007 and CVE-2020-28008 are very similar to
https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2016/DebianEximSpoolLocalRoot/.
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28014: Arbitrary file creation and clobbering
========================================================================
An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user can abuse the
-oP override\_pid\_file\_path option to create (or overwrite) an arbitrary
file, as root. The attacker does not, however, control the contents of
this file:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=107(Debian-exim) gid=114(Debian-exim) groups=114(Debian-exim)
/usr/sbin/exim4 -bdf -oX 0 -oP /etc/ld.so.preload &
[1] 3371
sleep 3
kill -9 "$!"
[1]+ Killed /usr/sbin/exim4 -bdf -oX 0 -oP /etc/ld.so.preload
ls -l /etc/ld.so.preload
ERROR: ld.so: object '3371' from /etc/ld.so.preload cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored.
-rw-r--r-- 1 root Debian-exim 5 Nov 4 20:20 /etc/ld.so.preload
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The attacker can also combine this vulnerability with CVE-2020-28007 or
CVE-2020-28008 to create an arbitrary file with arbitrary contents and
obtain full root privileges.
========================================================================
CVE-2021-27216: Arbitrary file deletion
========================================================================
While working on a patch for CVE-2020-28014, we discovered another
related vulnerability: any local user can delete any arbitrary file as
root (for example, /etc/passwd), by abusing the -oP and -oPX options in
delete\_pid\_file():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
932 void
933 delete\_pid\_file(void)
934 {
935 uschar \* daemon\_pid = string\_sprintf("%d\n", (int)getppid());
...
939 if ((f = Ufopen(pid\_file\_path, "rb")))
940 {
941 if ( fgets(CS big\_buffer, big\_buffer\_size, f)
942 && Ustrcmp(daemon\_pid, big\_buffer) == 0
943 )
944 if (Uunlink(pid\_file\_path) == 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To exploit this vulnerability, a local attacker must win an easy race
condition between the fopen() at line 939 and the unlink() at line 944;
this is left as an exercise for the interested reader.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28011: Heap buffer overflow in queue\_run()
========================================================================
Through the -R deliver\_selectstring and -S deliver\_selectstring\_sender
options, the "exim" user can overflow the heap-based big\_buffer in
queue\_run() (lines 419 and 423):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
412 p = big\_buffer;
...
418 if (deliver\_selectstring)
419 p += sprintf(CS p, " -R%s %s", f.deliver\_selectstring\_regex? "r" : "",
420 deliver\_selectstring);
421
422 if (deliver\_selectstring\_sender)
423 p += sprintf(CS p, " -S%s %s", f.deliver\_selectstring\_sender\_regex? "r" : "",
424 deliver\_selectstring\_sender);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user
to obtain full root privileges.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28010: Heap out-of-bounds write in main()
========================================================================
For debugging and logging purposes, Exim copies the current working
directory (initial\_cwd) into the heap-based big\_buffer:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3665 initial\_cwd = os\_getcwd(NULL, 0);
....
3945 uschar \*p = big\_buffer;
3946 Ustrcpy(p, "cwd= (failed)");
....
3952 Ustrncpy(p + 4, initial\_cwd, big\_buffer\_size-5);
3953 p += 4 + Ustrlen(initial\_cwd);
....
3956 \*p = '\0';
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The strncpy() at line 3952 cannot overflow big\_buffer, but (on Linux at
least) initial\_cwd can be much longer than big\_buffer\_size (16KB): line
3953 can increase p past big\_buffer's end, and line 3956 (and beyond)
can write out of big\_buffer's bounds.
We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unprivileged local attacker to obtain full root
privileges.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28013: Heap buffer overflow in parse\_fix\_phrase()
========================================================================
If a local attacker executes Exim with a -F '.(' option (for example),
then parse\_fix\_phrase() calls strncpy() with a -1 size (which overflows
the destination buffer, because strncpy(dest, src, n) "writes additional
null bytes to dest to ensure that a total of n bytes are written").
Indeed, at line 1124 s and ss are both equal to end, at line 1125 ss is
decremented, and at line 1127 ss-s is equal to -1:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28015: New-line injection into spool header file (local)
========================================================================
When Exim receives a mail, it creates two files in the "input"
subdirectory of its spool directory: a "data" file, which contains the
body of the mail, and a "header" file, which contains the headers of the
mail and important metadata (the sender and the recipient addresses, for
example). Such a header file consists of lines of text separated by '\n'
characters.
Unfortunately, an unprivileged local attacker can send a mail to a
recipient whose address contains '\n' characters, and can therefore
inject new lines into the spool header file and change Exim's behavior:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The effect of this vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-8794 in
OpenSMTPD, but in Exim's case it is not enough to execute arbitrary
commands. To understand how we transformed this vulnerability into an
arbitrary command execution, we must digress briefly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Digression
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the vulnerabilities in this advisory are memory corruptions, and
despite modern protections such as ASLR, NX, and malloc hardening,
memory corruptions in Exim are easy to exploit:
1/ Exim's memory allocator (store.c, which calls malloc() and free()
internally) unintentionally provides attackers with powerful exploit
primitives. In particular, if an attacker can pass a negative size to
the allocator (through an integer overflow or direct control), then:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
119 static void \*next\_yield[NPOOLS];
120 static int yield\_length[NPOOLS] = { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 };
...
231 void \*
232 store\_get\_3(int size, BOOL tainted, const char \*func, int linenumber)
233 {
...
248 if (size > yield\_length[pool])
249 {
...
294 }
...
299 store\_last\_get[pool] = next\_yield[pool];
...
316 next\_yield[pool] = (void \*)(CS next\_yield[pool] + size);
317 yield\_length[pool] -= size;
318 return store\_last\_get[pool];
319 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1a/ At line 248, store\_get() believes that the current block of memory
is large enough (because size is negative), and goes to line 299. As a
result, store\_get()'s caller can overflow the current block of memory (a
"forward-overflow").
1b/ At line 317, the free size of the current block of memory
(yield\_length) is mistakenly increased (because size is negative), and
at line 316, the next pointer returned by store\_get() (next\_yield) is
mistakenly decreased (because size is negative). As a result, the next
memory allocation can overwrite the beginning of Exim's heap: a relative
write-what-where, which naturally bypasses ASLR (a "backward-jump", or
"back-jump").
2/ The beginning of the heap contains Exim's configuration, which
includes various strings that are passed to expand\_string() at run time.
Consequently, an attacker who can "back-jump" can overwrite these
strings with "${run{...}}" and execute arbitrary commands (thus
bypassing NX).
The first recorded use of expand\_string() in an Exim exploit is
CVE-2010-4344 (and CVE-2010-4345), an important part of Internet
folklore:
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/12/10/1
Note: Exim 4.94 (the latest version) introduces "tainted" memory (i.e.,
untrusted, possibly attacker-controlled data) and refuses to process it
in expand\_string(). This mechanism protects Exim against unintentional
expansion of tainted data (CVE-2014-2957 and CVE-2019-10149), but NOT
against memory corruption: an attacker can simply overwrite untainted
memory with tainted data, and still execute arbitrary commands in
expand\_string(). For example, we exploited CVE-2020-28015,
CVE-2020-28012, and CVE-2020-28021 in Exim 4.94.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVE-2020-28015 allows us to inject new lines into a spool header file.
To transform this vulnerability into an arbitrary command execution (as
root, since deliver\_drop\_privilege is false by default), we exploit the
following code in spool\_read\_header():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
341 int n;
...
910 while ((n = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)
911 {
...
914 int i;
915
916 if (!isdigit(n)) goto SPOOL\_FORMAT\_ERROR;
917 if(ungetc(n, fp) == EOF || fscanf(fp, "%d%c ", &n, flag) == EOF)
918 goto SPOOL\_READ\_ERROR;
...
927 h->text = store\_get(n+1, TRUE); /\* tainted \*/
...
935 for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
936 {
937 int c = fgetc(fp);
...
940 h->text[i] = c;
941 }
942 h->text[i] = 0;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at line 917, we start a fake header with a negative length n;
- at line 927, we back-jump to the beginning of the heap (Digression
1b), because n is negative;
- at line 935, we avoid the forward-overflow (Digression 1a), because n
is negative;
- then, our next fake header is allocated to the beginning of the heap
and overwrites Exim's configuration strings (with "${run{command}}");
- last, our arbitrary command is executed when deliver\_message()
processes our fake (injected) recipient and expands the overwritten
configuration strings (Digression 2).
We can also transform CVE-2020-28015 into an information disclosure, by
exploiting the following code in spool\_read\_header():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
756 for (recipients\_count = 0; recipients\_count < rcount; recipients\_count++)
757 {
...
765 if (Ufgets(big\_buffer, big\_buffer\_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL\_READ\_ERROR;
766 nn = Ustrlen(big\_buffer);
767 if (nn < 2) goto SPOOL\_FORMAT\_ERROR;
...
772 p = big\_buffer + nn - 1;
773 \*p-- = 0;
...
809 while (isdigit(\*p)) p--;
...
840 else if (\*p == '#')
841 {
842 int flags;
...
848 (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d", &flags);
849
850 if ((flags & 0x01) != 0) /\* one\_time data exists \*/
851 {
852 int len;
853 while (isdigit(\*(--p)) || \*p == ',' || \*p == '-');
854 (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d,%d", &len, &pno);
855 \*p = 0;
856 if (len > 0)
857 {
858 p -= len;
859 errors\_to = string\_copy\_taint(p, TRUE);
860 }
861 }
862
863 \*(--p) = 0; /\* Terminate address \*/
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, if we send a mail to the recipient
'"X@localhost\njane@localhost 8192,-1#1\n\n1024\* "' (where jane is our
username, and localhost is one of Exim's local\_domains), then:
- at line 848, we set flags to 1;
- at line 854, we set len to 8KB;
- at line 858, we decrease p (by 8KB) toward the beginning of the heap;
- at line 859, we read the errors\_to string out of big\_buffer's bounds;
- finally, we receive our mail, which includes the out-of-bounds
errors\_to string in its "From" and "Return-path:" headers (in this
example, errors\_to contains a fragment of /etc/passwd):
------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28012: Missing close-on-exec flag for privileged pipe
========================================================================
Exim supports a special kind of .forward file called "exim filter" (if
allow\_filter is true, the default on Debian). To handle such a filter,
the privileged Exim process creates an unprivileged process and a pipe
for communication. The filter process can fork() and execute arbitrary
commands with expand\_string(); this is not a security issue in itself,
because the filter process is unprivileged. Unfortunately, the writable
end of the communication pipe is not closed-on-exec and an unprivileged
local attacker can therefore send arbitrary data to the privileged Exim
process (which is running as root).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We exploit this vulnerability through the following code in
rda\_interpret(), which reads our arbitrary data in the privileged Exim
process:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
791 fd = pfd[pipe\_read];
792 if (read(fd, filtertype, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int) ||
793 read(fd, &yield, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int) ||
794 !rda\_read\_string(fd, error)) goto DISASTER;
...
804 if (!rda\_read\_string(fd, &s)) goto DISASTER;
...
956 \*error = string\_sprintf("internal problem in %s: failure to transfer "
957 "data from subprocess: status=%04x%s%s%s", rname,
958 status, readerror,
959 (\*error == NULL)? US"" : US": error=",
960 (\*error == NULL)? US"" : \*error);
961 log\_write(0, LOG\_MAIN|LOG\_PANIC, "%s", \*error);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
where:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
467 static BOOL
468 rda\_read\_string(int fd, uschar \*\*sp)
469 {
470 int len;
471
472 if (read(fd, &len, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int)) return FALSE;
...
479 if (read(fd, \*sp = store\_get(len, FALSE), len) != len) return FALSE;
480 return TRUE;
481 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at line 794, we allocate an arbitrary string (of arbitrary length),
error;
- at line 804 (and line 479), we back-jump to the beginning of the heap
(Digression 1b) and avoid the forward-overflow (Digression 1a) because
our len is negative;
- at line 956, we overwrite the beginning of the heap with a string that
we control (error); we tried to overwrite Exim's configuration strings
(Digression 2) but failed to execute arbitrary commands; instead, we
overwrite file\_path, a copy of log\_file\_path (mentioned in
CVE-2020-28007);
- at line 961, we append an arbitrary string that we control (error) to
a file whose name we control (file\_path): we add an arbitrary user to
/etc/passwd and obtain full root privileges.
This first version of our exploit succeeds on Debian oldstable's
exim4\_4.89-2+deb9u7 (it fails on Debian stable's exim4\_4.92-8+deb10u4
because of a gstring\_reset\_unused() in string\_sprintf(); we have not
tried to work around this problem), but it fails on Debian testing's
exim4\_4.94-8: the pool of memory that we back-jump at line 804 is
untainted, but the string at line 956 is tainted and written to a
different pool of memory (because our primary recipient, and hence
rname, are tainted).
To work around this problem, our "exim filter" generates a secondary
recipient that is naturally untainted (line 479). When this secondary
recipient is processed, the string at line 956 is untainted and thus
overwrites the beginning of the heap (because it is allocated in the
untainted pool of memory that we back-jumped at line 804): this second
version of our exploit also succeeds on Debian testing.
Finally, we use one noteworthy trick in our exploit: in theory, the
string that overwrites file\_path at line 956 cannot be longer than 256
bytes (LOG\_NAME\_SIZE); this significantly slows our brute-force of the
correct back-jump distance. In practice, we can overwrite file\_path with
a much longer string (up to 8KB, LOG\_BUFFER\_SIZE) because file\_path is a
format string, and "%0Lu" (or "%.0D") is a NOP in Exim's string\_format()
function: it consumes no argument and produces no output, thus avoiding
the overflow of buffer[LOG\_NAME\_SIZE] in open\_log().
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28009: Integer overflow in get\_stdinput()
========================================================================
The following loop reads lines from stdin as long as the last character
of the lines is '\\' (line 1273). Each line that is read is appended to
a "growable string", the gstring g (at line 1266):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1229 gstring \* g = NULL;
....
1233 for (i = 0;; i++)
1234 {
1235 uschar buffer[1024];
....
1252 if (Ufgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) break;
1253 p = buffer;
....
1258 ss = p + (int)Ustrlen(p);
....
1266 g = string\_catn(g, p, ss - p);
....
1273 if (ss == p || g->s[g->ptr-1] != '\\')
1274 break;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eventually, the integer g->size of the growable string overflows, and
becomes negative (in gstring\_grow(), which is called by string\_catn()).
Consequently, in store\_newblock() (which is called by gstring\_grow()),
newsize is negative:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
506 void \*
507 store\_newblock\_3(void \* block, int newsize, int len,
508 const char \* filename, int linenumber)
509 {
510 BOOL release\_ok = store\_last\_get[store\_pool] == block;
511 uschar \* newtext = store\_get(newsize);
512
513 memcpy(newtext, block, len);
514 if (release\_ok) store\_release\_3(block, filename, linenumber);
515 return (void \*)newtext;
516 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- the store\_get() at line 511 back-jumps the current block of memory
(Digression 1b);
- the memcpy() at line 513 forward-overflows the current block of memory
(Digression 1a).
If exploitable, this vulnerability would allow an unprivileged local
attacker to obtain full root privileges. We have not tried to exploit
this vulnerability, because it took more than 5 days to overflow the
integer g->size. Indeed, the loop in get\_stdinput() has an O(n^2) time
complexity: for each line that is read, store\_newblock() allocates a new
block of memory (at line 511) and recopies the entire contents of the
growable string (at line 513).

CVE-2020-28017: Integer overflow in receive\_add\_recipient()
========================================================================
By default, Exim does not limit the number of recipients (the number of
valid RCPT TO commands) for a mail. But after 52428800 (50M) recipients,
the multiplication at line 492 overflows, and the size that is passed to
store\_get() becomes negative (2\*50M \* 40B = -96MB):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
484 void
485 receive\_add\_recipient(uschar \*recipient, int pno)
486 {
487 if (recipients\_count >= recipients\_list\_max)
488 {
489 recipient\_item \*oldlist = recipients\_list;
490 int oldmax = recipients\_list\_max;
491 recipients\_list\_max = recipients\_list\_max ? 2\*recipients\_list\_max : 50;
492 recipients\_list = store\_get(recipients\_list\_max \* sizeof(recipient\_item));
493 if (oldlist != NULL)
494 memcpy(recipients\_list, oldlist, oldmax \* sizeof(recipient\_item));
495 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at line 492, store\_get() back-jumps the current block of memory
(Digression 1b), by -96MB;
- at line 494, memcpy() forward-overflows the current block of memory
(Digression 1a), by nearly 2GB (50M \* 40B = 2000MB).
Initially, we thought that CVE-2020-28017 would be the perfect
vulnerability:
- it affects all versions of Exim (since at least the beginning of its
Git history in 2004);
- it is certainly exploitable (an unauthenticated RCE as the "exim"
user): the forward-overflow can be absorbed to avoid a crash, and the
back-jump can be directed onto Exim's configuration (Digression 2);
- a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggested that an exploit would
require "only" 6GB of memory: 2\*2GB for all the recipients\_lists, and
2GB of recipient addresses to absorb the forward-overflow.
Eventually, however, we abandoned the exploitation of CVE-2020-28017:
- On Exim 4.89 (Debian oldstable), the ACLs (Access Control Lists) for
the RCPT TO command consume approximately 512 bytes per recipient: an
exploit would require more than 50M \* 512B = 25GB of memory. Instead,
we decided to exploit another vulnerability, CVE-2020-28020, which
requires only 3GB of memory.
- On Exim 4.92 (Debian stable), the ACLs for RCPT TO consume at least
4KB per recipient. Indeed, this version's string\_sprintf() allocates a
whole new 32KB memory block, but uses only one page (4KB): an exploit
would require more than 50M \* 4KB = 200GB of memory.
- On Exim 4.94 (Debian testing), the problem with string\_sprintf() was
solved, and an exploit would therefore require "only" 25GB of memory.
However, the "tainted" checks create another problem: each RCPT TO
allocates T blocks of tainted memory, and makes U is\_tainted() checks
on untainted memory, but each check traverses the complete linked list
of tainted memory blocks. For n recipients, this has an O(n^2) time
complexity (roughly U\*T\*(n^2)/2): it would take months to reach 50M
recipients.
CVE-2020-28017 is also exploitable locally (through -bS and
smtp\_setup\_batch\_msg(), which does not have ACLs), and would allow an
unprivileged local attacker to obtain the privileges of the "exim" user.
But better vulnerabilities exist: CVE-2020-28015 and CVE-2020-28012 are
locally exploitable and yield full root privileges.

CVE-2020-28020: Integer overflow in receive\_msg()
========================================================================
During our work on Exim, we stumbled across the following commit:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
commit 56ac062a3ff94fc4e1bbfc2293119c079a4e980b
Date: Thu Jan 10 21:15:11 2019 +0000

+ induce a crash of the recive process; now the message is cleanly rejected.
...
+ if (header\_size >= INT\_MAX/2)
+ goto OVERSIZE;
header\_size \*= 2;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This vulnerability is exploitable in all Exim versions before 4.92 and
allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands
as the "exim" user. Because this commit was not identified as a security
patch, it was not backported to LTS (Long Term Support) distributions.
For example, Debian oldstable's package (exim4\_4.89-2+deb9u7) contains
all known security patches, but is vulnerable to CVE-2020-28020 and
hence remotely exploitable.
By default, Exim limits the size of a mail header to 1MB
(header\_maxsize). Unfortunately, an attacker can bypass this limit by
sending only continuation lines (i.e., '\n' followed by ' ' or '\t'),
thereby overflowing the integer header\_size at line 1782:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1778 if (ptr >= header\_size - 4)
1779 {
1780 int oldsize = header\_size;
1781 /\* header\_size += 256; \*/
1782 header\_size \*= 2;
1783 if (!store\_extend(next->text, oldsize, header\_size))
1784 {
1785 BOOL release\_ok = store\_last\_get[store\_pool] == next->text;
1786 uschar \*newtext = store\_get(header\_size);
1787 memcpy(newtext, next->text, ptr);
1788 if (release\_ok) store\_release(next->text);
1789 next->text = newtext;
1790 }
1791 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ironically, this vulnerability was the most difficult to exploit:
- when the integer header\_size overflows, it becomes negative (INT\_MIN),
but we cannot exploit the resulting back-jump at line 1786 (Digression
1b), because the free size of the current memory block also becomes
negative (because 0 - INT\_MIN = INT\_MIN, the "Leblancian Paradox"),
which prevents us from writing to this back-jumped memory block;
- to overflow the integer header\_size, we must send 1GB to Exim:
consequently, our exploit must succeed after only a few tries (in
particular, we cannot brute-force ASLR).
Note: we can actually overflow header\_size with 1GB / 2 = 512MB; if we
send a first line that ends with "\r\n", then Exim transforms every bare
'\n' that we send into "\n " (a continuation line):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1814 if (ch == '\n')
1815 {
1816 if (first\_line\_ended\_crlf == TRUE\_UNSET) first\_line\_ended\_crlf = FALSE;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To exploit this vulnerability (on Debian oldstable, for example):
1/ We send three separate mails (in the same SMTP session) to achieve
the following memory layout:
mmap memory
-----|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----
... |n|l| mblock3 |n|l| mblock2 |n|l| mblock1 | ...
-----|-------------------|-------------------|+------------------|-----
|
heap memory |
-------------------------|v-------------|-----
... |N|L|N|L|N|L|N|L|N|L|n|l| hblock | ...
-------------------------|--------------|-----
<- fake storeblock ->
where n and l are the next and length members of a storeblock structure
(a linked list of allocated memory blocks):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
71 typedef struct storeblock {
72 struct storeblock \*next;
73 size\_t length;
74 } storeblock;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- we first allocate a 1GB mmap block (mblock1) by sending a mail that
contains a 256MB header of bare '\n' characters; the next member of
mblock1's storeblock structure initially points to a heap block
(hblock, which immediately follows data that we control);
- we allocate a second 1GB mmap block (mblock2) by sending a mail that
also contains a 256MB header of bare '\n' characters;
- we allocate a third 1GB mmap block (mblock3) by sending a mail that
contains a 512MB header; this overflows the integer header\_size, and
forward-overflows mblock3 (Digression 1a), into mblock2 and mblock1:
we overwrite mblock2's next pointer with NULL (to avoid a crash in
store\_release() at line 1788) and we partially overwrite mblock1's
next pointer (with a single null byte).
2/ After this overflow, store\_reset() traverses the linked list of
allocated memory blocks and follows mblock1's overwritten next pointer,
to our own "fake storeblock" structure: a NULL next pointer N (to avoid
a crash in store\_reset()), and a large length L that covers the entire
address space (for example, 0x7050505070505050). As a result, Exim's
allocator believes that the entire heap is one large, free block of
POOL\_MAIN memory (Exim's main type of memory allocations).
This powerful exploit primitive gives us write access to the entire
heap, through POOL\_MAIN allocations. But the heap also contains other
types of allocations: we exploit this primitive to overwrite POOL\_MAIN
allocations with raw malloc()s (for information disclosure) and to
overwrite POOL\_PERM allocations with POOL\_MAIN allocations (for
arbitrary code execution).
3/ Information disclosure:
- First, we send an EHLO command that allocates a large string in raw
malloc() memory.
- Second, we send an invalid RCPT TO command that allocates a small
string in POOL\_MAIN memory (an error message); this small POOL\_MAIN
string overwrites the beginning of the large malloc() string.
- Next, we send an invalid EHLO command that free()s the large malloc()
string; this free() overwrites the beginning of the small POOL\_MAIN
string with a pointer to the libc (a member of libc's malloc\_chunk
structure).
- Last, we send an invalid DATA command that responds with an error
message: the small, overwritten POOL\_MAIN string, and hence the libc
pointer. This information leak is essentially the technique that we
used for CVE-2015-0235 (GHOST).
4/ Arbitrary code execution:
- First, we start a new mail (MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA commands);
this calls dkim\_exim\_verify\_init() and allocates a pdkim\_ctx structure
in POOL\_PERM memory (DKIM is enabled by default since Exim 4.70):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
249 typedef struct pdkim\_ctx {
...
263 int(\*dns\_txt\_callback)(char \*, char \*);
...
274 } pdkim\_ctx;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Second, we send a mail header that is allocated to POOL\_MAIN memory,
and overwrite the pdkim\_ctx structure: we overwrite dns\_txt\_callback
with a pointer to libc's system() function (we derive this pointer
from the information-leaked libc pointer).
- Next, we send a "DKIM-Signature:" header (we particularly care about
its "selector" field).
- Last, we end our mail; this calls dkim\_exim\_verify\_finish(), which
calls the overwritten dns\_txt\_callback with a first argument that we
control (through the selector field of our "DKIM-Signature:" header):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1328 dns\_txt\_name = string\_sprintf("%s.\_domainkey.%s.", sig->selector, sig->domain);
....
1333 if ( ctx->dns\_txt\_callback(CS dns\_txt\_name, CS dns\_txt\_reply) != PDKIM\_OK
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In other words, we execute system() with an arbitrary command.
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28023: Out-of-bounds read in smtp\_setup\_msg()
========================================================================
In smtp\_setup\_msg(), which reads the SMTP commands sent by a client to
the Exim server:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1455 int smtp\_ch\_index = 0;
....
1459 uschar smtp\_connection\_had[SMTP\_HBUFF\_SIZE];
------------------------------------------------------------------------
126 #define HAD(n) \
127 smtp\_connection\_had[smtp\_ch\_index++] = n; \
128 if (smtp\_ch\_index >= SMTP\_HBUFF\_SIZE) smtp\_ch\_index = 0
....
5283 case DATA\_CMD:
5284 HAD(SCH\_DATA);
....
5305 smtp\_printf("503 Valid RCPT command must precede %s\r\n", FALSE,
5306 smtp\_names[smtp\_connection\_had[smtp\_ch\_index-1]]);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- line 5284 (line 128 in HAD()) can reset smtp\_ch\_index to 0 (an index
into the circular buffer smtp\_connection\_had[]);
- line 5306 therefore reads smtp\_connection\_had[-1] out-of-bounds (an
unsigned char index into the array smtp\_names[]);
- depending on the value of this unsigned char index, line 5306 may also
read smtp\_names[smtp\_connection\_had[-1]] out-of-bounds (a pointer to a
string);
- and line 5305 sends this string to the SMTP client and may therefore
disclose sensitive information to an unauthenticated remote attacker.
On Debian, this out-of-bounds read is not exploitable, because
smtp\_connection\_had[-1] is always 0 and line 5305 sends smtp\_names[0]
("NONE") to the client. However, the memory layout of the Exim binary
may be more favorable to attackers on other operating systems.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28021: New-line injection into spool header file (remote)
========================================================================
An authenticated SMTP client can add an AUTH= parameter to its MAIL FROM
command. This AUTH= parameter is decoded by auth\_xtextdecode():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
4697 case ENV\_MAIL\_OPT\_AUTH:
....
4703 if (auth\_xtextdecode(value, &authenticated\_sender) < 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
and the resulting authenticated\_sender is written to the spool header
file without encoding or escaping:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
212 if (authenticated\_sender)
213 fprintf(fp, "-auth\_sender %s\n", authenticated\_sender);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, authenticated\_sender can contain arbitrary characters,
because auth\_xtextdecode() translates hexadecimal +XY sequences into
equivalent characters (for example, +0A into '\n'): an authenticated
remote attacker can inject new lines into the spool header file and
execute arbitrary commands, as root.
This vulnerability is particularly problematic for Internet service
providers and mail providers that deploy Exim and offer mail accounts
but not shell accounts. It is also problematic when combined with an
authentication bypass such as CVE-2020-12783, discovered by Orange Tsai
in May 2020 (https://bugs.exim.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2571).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our exploit for CVE-2020-28021 is essentially the same as our exploit
for CVE-2020-28015. The main difference is that Exim's ACLs limit the
length of our header lines to 998 characters. However, this limit can be
easily bypassed, by splitting long header lines into 990-character lines
separated by "\n " (i.e., continuation lines).
We can also transform CVE-2020-28021 into an information disclosure:
- First, we inject an arbitrary recipient line into the spool header
file: an arbitrary recipient address (for example, attacker@fake.com)
and an errors\_to string that is read out-of-bounds (the same technique
as for CVE-2020-28015).
- Next, we wait for Exim to connect to our own mail server, fake.com's
MX (we use https://github.com/iphelix/dnschef to set up a quick and
easy DNS server).
- Last, we retrieve the out-of-bounds errors\_to string from Exim's MAIL
FROM command (which, in this example, contains a fragment of
/etc/passwd):

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28022: Heap out-of-bounds read and write in extract\_option()
========================================================================
The name=value parameters such as AUTH= are extracted from MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands by extract\_option():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1994 static BOOL
1995 extract\_option(uschar \*\*name, uschar \*\*value)
1996 {
1997 uschar \*n;
1998 uschar \*v = smtp\_cmd\_data + Ustrlen(smtp\_cmd\_data) - 1;
....
2001 while (v > smtp\_cmd\_data && \*v != '=' && !isspace(\*v))
2002 {
....
2005 if (\*v == '"') do v--; while (\*v != '"' && v > smtp\_cmd\_data+1);
2006 v--;
2007 }
2008
2009 n = v;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, this function can decrease v (value) and hence n (name)
out of smtp\_cmd\_data's bounds (into the preceding smtp\_cmd\_buffer):
- at line 2001, v can point to smtp\_cmd\_data + 1;
- at line 2005, v-- decrements v to smtp\_cmd\_data;
- at line 2006, v-- decrements v to smtp\_cmd\_data - 1.
Subsequently, the code in extract\_option() and smtp\_setup\_msg() reads
from and writes to v and n out of smtp\_cmd\_data's bounds.
If exploitable, this vulnerability would allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the "exim" user. So far we
were unable to exploit this vulnerability: although we are able to
decrease v and n out of smtp\_cmd\_data's bounds, we were unable to
decrease v or n out of the preceding smtp\_cmd\_buffer's bounds.
Surprisingly, however, we do use this vulnerability in our
proof-of-concept for CVE-2020-28026.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28026: Line truncation and injection in spool\_read\_header()
========================================================================
spool\_read\_header() calls fgets() to read the lines from a spool header
file into the 16KB big\_buffer. The first section of spool\_read\_header()
enlarges big\_buffer dynamically if fgets() truncates a line (if a line
is longer than 16KB):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
460 if (Ufgets(big\_buffer, big\_buffer\_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL\_READ\_ERROR;
...
462 while ( (len = Ustrlen(big\_buffer)) == big\_buffer\_size-1
463 && big\_buffer[len-1] != '\n'
...
468 buf = store\_get\_perm(big\_buffer\_size \*= 2, FALSE);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, the second section of spool\_read\_header() does not
enlarge big\_buffer:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
756 for (recipients\_count = 0; recipients\_count < rcount; recipients\_count++)
...
765 if (Ufgets(big\_buffer, big\_buffer\_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL\_READ\_ERROR;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If DSN (Delivery Status Notification) is enabled (it is disabled by
default), an attacker can send a RCPT TO command with a long ORCPT=
parameter that is written to the spool header file by
spool\_write\_header():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
292 for (int i = 0; i < recipients\_count; i++)
293 {
294 recipient\_item \*r = recipients\_list + i;
...
302 uschar \* errors\_to = r->errors\_to ? r->errors\_to : US"";
...
305 uschar \* orcpt = r->orcpt ? r->orcpt : US"";
306
307 fprintf(fp, "%s %s %d,%d %s %d,%d#3\n", r->address, orcpt, Ustrlen(orcpt),
308 r->dsn\_flags, errors\_to, Ustrlen(errors\_to), r->pno);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This long ORCPT= parameter truncates the recipient line (when read by
fgets() in spool\_read\_header()) and injects the remainder of the line as
a separate line, thereby emulating the '\n' injection of CVE-2020-28015
and CVE-2020-28021 (albeit in a weaker form).
We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as root (if DSN is enabled).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof of concept
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Intuitively, it seems impossible to generate a recipient line longer
than 16KB (big\_buffer\_size), because the Exim server reads our RCPT TO
command into a 16KB buffer (smtp\_cmd\_buffer) that must also contain
(besides our long ORCPT= parameter) "RCPT TO:", "NOTIFY=DELAY", and
the recipient address.
- We can, however, use the special recipient "postmaster", which is
automatically qualified (by appending Exim's primary hostname) before
it is written to the spool header file. This allows us to enlarge the
recipient line, but is not sufficient to control the end of the
truncated line (unless Exim's primary hostname is longer than 24
bytes, which is very unlikely).
- But we can do better: we can use CVE-2020-28022 to read our ORCPT=
parameter out of smtp\_cmd\_data's bounds (from the end of the preceding
smtp\_cmd\_buffer). This allows us to further enlarge the recipient line
(by 10 bytes, because "postmaster" is now included in our ORCPT=), but
is not sufficient to reliably control the end of the truncated line
(unless Exim's primary hostname is longer than 14 bytes, which is
still very unlikely).
- But we can do much better: we do not need postmaster's automatic
qualification anymore, because the recipient is now included in our
ORCPT= parameter -- the longer the recipient, the better. On Debian,
the user "systemd-timesync" exists by default, and "localhost" is one
of Exim's local\_domains: the recipient "systemd-timesync@localhost" is
long enough to reliably control the end of the truncated recipient
line, and allows us to read and write out of big\_buffer's bounds
(lines 859 and 863, and beyond):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
840 else if (\*p == '#')
...
848 (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d", &flags);
849
850 if ((flags & 0x01) != 0) /\* one\_time data exists \*/
851 {
852 int len;
853 while (isdigit(\*(--p)) || \*p == ',' || \*p == '-');
854 (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d,%d", &len, &pno);
855 \*p = 0;
856 if (len > 0)
857 {
858 p -= len;
859 errors\_to = string\_copy\_taint(p, TRUE);
860 }
861 }
862
863 \*(--p) = 0; /\* Terminate address \*/

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28019: Failure to reset function pointer after BDAT error
========================================================================
To read SMTP commands and data from a client, Exim calls the function
pointer receive\_getc, which points to either smtp\_getc() (a cleartext
connection) or tls\_getc() (an encrypted connection). If the client uses
the BDAT command (instead of DATA) to send a mail, then Exim saves the
current value of receive\_getc to the function pointer lwr\_receive\_getc
and sets receive\_getc to the wrapper function bdat\_getc():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5242 case BDAT\_CMD:
....
5271 lwr\_receive\_getc = receive\_getc;
....
5275 receive\_getc = bdat\_getc;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exim normally resets receive\_getc to its original value
(lwr\_receive\_getc) when the client ends its mail. Unfortunately, Exim
fails to reset receive\_getc in some cases; for example, if the mail is
larger than message\_size\_limit (50MB by default). Consequently, Exim
re-enters smtp\_setup\_msg() while receive\_getc still points to
bdat\_getc(), and:
- smtp\_read\_command() calls receive\_getc and hence bdat\_getc(), which
also calls smtp\_read\_command(), which is not a re-entrant function and
may have unintended consequences;
- if the client issues another BDAT command, then receive\_getc and
lwr\_receive\_getc both point to bdat\_getc(), which calls itself
recursively and leads to stack exhaustion; for example:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(
sleep 10;
echo 'EHLO test';
sleep 3;
echo 'MAIL FROM:<>';
sleep 3;
echo 'RCPT TO:postmaster';
sleep 3;

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28024: Heap buffer underflow in smtp\_ungetc()
========================================================================
Exim calls smtp\_refill() to read input characters from an SMTP client
into the 8KB smtp\_inbuffer, and calls smtp\_getc() to read individual
characters from smtp\_inbuffer:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
501 static BOOL
502 smtp\_refill(unsigned lim)
503 {
...
512 rc = read(fileno(smtp\_in), smtp\_inbuffer, MIN(IN\_BUFFER\_SIZE-1, lim));
...
515 if (rc <= 0)
516 {
...
536 return FALSE;
537 }
...
541 smtp\_inend = smtp\_inbuffer + rc;
542 smtp\_inptr = smtp\_inbuffer;
543 return TRUE;
544 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
559 int
560 smtp\_getc(unsigned lim)
561 {
562 if (smtp\_inptr >= smtp\_inend)
563 if (!smtp\_refill(lim))
564 return EOF;
565 return \*smtp\_inptr++;
566 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exim implements an smtp\_ungetc() function to push characters back into
smtp\_inbuffer (characters that were read from smtp\_inbuffer by
smtp\_getc()):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
795 int
796 smtp\_ungetc(int ch)
797 {
798 \*--smtp\_inptr = ch;
799 return ch;
800 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, Exim also calls smtp\_ungetc() to push back "characters"
that were not actually read from smtp\_inbuffer: EOF (-1), and if BDAT is
used, EOD and ERR (-2 and -3). For example, in receive\_msg():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1945 if (ch == '\r')
1946 {
1947 ch = (receive\_getc)(GETC\_BUFFER\_UNLIMITED);
1948 if (ch == '\n')
1949 {
....
1952 }
....
1957 ch = (receive\_ungetc)(ch);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at line 1947, receive\_getc (smtp\_getc()) can return EOF;
- at line 1957, this EOF is passed to receive\_ungetc (smtp\_ungetc());
- at line 798 (in smtp\_ungetc()), if smtp\_inptr is exactly equal to
smtp\_inbuffer, then it is decremented to smtp\_inbuffer - 1, and EOF is
written out of smtp\_inbuffer's bounds.
To return EOF in receive\_msg() while smtp\_inptr is equal to
smtp\_inbuffer, we must initiate a TLS-encrypted connection:
- either through TLS-on-connect (usually on port 465), which does not
use smtp\_inptr nor smtp\_inbuffer;
- or through STARTTLS, which resets smtp\_inptr to smtp\_inbuffer in the
following code (if X\_PIPE\_CONNECT is enabled, the default since Exim
4.94):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5484 if (receive\_smtp\_buffered())
5485 {
5486 DEBUG(D\_any)
5487 debug\_printf("Non-empty input buffer after STARTTLS; naive attack?\n");
5488 if (tls\_in.active.sock < 0)
5489 smtp\_inend = smtp\_inptr = smtp\_inbuffer;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In both cases:
- first, we initiate a TLS-encrypted connection, which sets receive\_getc
and receive\_ungetc to tls\_getc() and tls\_ungetc() (while smtp\_inptr is
equal to smtp\_inbuffer);
- second, we start a mail (MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA commands) and
enter receive\_msg();
- third, we send a bare '\r' character and reach line 1945;
- next, we terminate the TLS connection, which resets receive\_getc and
receive\_ungetc to smtp\_getc() and smtp\_ungetc() (while smtp\_inptr is
still equal to smtp\_inbuffer);
- last, we close the underlying TCP connection, which returns EOF at
line 1947 and writes EOF out of smtp\_inbuffer's bounds at line 1957
(line 798 in smtp\_ungetc()).
We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as the "exim" user (if TLS and either TLS-on-connect or
X\_PIPE\_CONNECT are enabled).
========================================================================
CVE-2020-28018: Use-after-free in tls-openssl.c
========================================================================
If Exim is built with OpenSSL, and if STARTTLS is enabled, and if
PIPELINING is enabled (the default), and if X\_PIPE\_CONNECT is disabled
(the default before Exim 4.94), then tls\_write() in tls-openssl.c is
vulnerable to a use-after-free.
If PIPELINING is used, Exim buffers the SMTP responses to MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands (in tls-openssl.c):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2909 int
2910 tls\_write(void \* ct\_ctx, const uschar \*buff, size\_t len, BOOL more)
2911 {
....
2915 static gstring \* server\_corked = NULL;
2916 gstring \*\* corkedp = ct\_ctx
2917 ? &((exim\_openssl\_client\_tls\_ctx \*)ct\_ctx)->corked : &server\_corked;
2918 gstring \* corked = \*corkedp;
....
2933 if (!ct\_ctx && (more || corked))
2934 {
....
2940 corked = string\_catn(corked, buff, len);
....
2946 if (more)
2947 {
2948 \*corkedp = corked;
2949 return len;
2950 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at line 2910, ct\_ctx is NULL, buff contains the SMTP response, and
more is true;
- at line 2940, a struct gstring (a "growable string", mentioned in
CVE-2020-28009) and its string buffer are allocated in POOL\_MAIN
memory:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
29 typedef struct gstring {
30 int size; /\* Current capacity of string memory \*/
31 int ptr; /\* Offset at which to append further chars \*/
32 uschar \* s; /\* The string memory \*/
33 } gstring;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at line 2948, a pointer to the struct gstring is saved to a local
static variable, server\_corked.
Unfortunately, if smtp\_reset() is called (in smtp\_setup\_msg()), then
store\_reset() is called and frees all allocated POOL\_MAIN memory, but
server\_corked is not reset to NULL: if tls\_write() is called again, the
struct gstring and its string buffer are used-after-free.
Side note: another use-after-free, CVE-2017-16943, was discovered by Meh
Chang in November 2017 (https://bugs.exim.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=2199).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To reliably control this vulnerability, we must prevent Exim from
calling tls\_write() between our call to smtp\_reset() and the actual
use-after-free:
- first, we send EHLO and STARTTLS (to initiate a TLS connection);
- second, we send EHLO and "MAIL FROM:<>\nNO" (to pipeline the first
half of a NOOP command, and to buffer the response to our MAIL FROM
command in tls\_write());
- third, we terminate the TLS connection (and fall back to cleartext)
and send "OP\n" (the second half of our pipelined NOOP command);
- next, we send EHLO (to force a call to smtp\_reset()) and STARTTLS (to
re-initiate a TLS connection);
- last, server\_corked is used-after-free (in tls\_write()) in response to
any SMTP command that we send.
This use-after-free of a struct gstring (server\_corked) and its string
buffer (server\_corked->s) is the most powerful vulnerability in this
advisory:
1/ We overwrite the string buffer (which is sent to us by tls\_write())
and transform this use-after-free into an information leak (we leak
pointers to the heap).
2/ We overwrite the struct gstring (with an arbitrary string pointer and
size) and transform the use-after-free into a read-what-where primitive:
we read the heap until we locate Exim's configuration.
3/ We overwrite the struct gstring (with an arbitrary string pointer)
and transform the use-after-free into a write-what-where primitive: we
overwrite Exim's configuration with an arbitrary "${run{command}}" that
is executed by expand\_string() as the "exim" user (Digression 2).
We use a few noteworthy tricks in our exploit:
1/ Information leak: To overwrite the string buffer without overwriting
the struct gstring itself, we send several pipelined RCPT TO commands to
re-allocate the string buffer (far away from the struct gstring), and
overwrite it with header\_line structures that contain pointers to the
heap.
2/ Read-what-where: We overwrite the struct gstring with arbitrary
binary data through the name=value parameter of a MAIL FROM command:
- we overwrite the s member with a pointer to the memory that we want to
read (a pointer to the heap);
- we overwrite the ptr member with the number of bytes that we want to
read;
- we overwrite the size member with the same number as ptr to prevent
string\_catn() from writing to the memory that we want to read (at line
2940 in tls\_write()).
3/ Write-what-where: We overwrite the struct gstring with arbitrary
binary data through the name=value parameter of a MAIL FROM command:
- we overwrite the s member with a pointer to the memory that we want to
overwrite (a pointer to Exim's configuration);
- we overwrite the ptr member with 0 and the size member with a large
arbitrary number;
- finally, we send a MAIL FROM command whose response overwrites Exim's
configuration with our arbitrary "${run{...}}" (which is eventually
executed by expand\_string()).
Note: Debian's Exim packages are built with GnuTLS, not OpenSSL; to
rebuild them with OpenSSL, we followed the detailed instructions at
https://gist.github.com/ryancdotorg/11025731.

CVE-2020-28025: Heap out-of-bounds read in pdkim\_finish\_bodyhash()
========================================================================
By default since Exim 4.70, receive\_msg() calls
dkim\_exim\_verify\_finish() to verify DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
signatures, which calls pdkim\_feed\_finish(), which calls
pdkim\_finish\_bodyhash():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
788 static void
789 pdkim\_finish\_bodyhash(pdkim\_ctx \* ctx)
790 {
...
799 for (pdkim\_signature \* sig = ctx->sig; sig; sig = sig->next)
800 {
...
825 if ( sig->bodyhash.data
826 && memcmp(b->bh.data, sig->bodyhash.data, b->bh.len) == 0)
827 {
...
829 }
830 else
831 {
...
838 sig->verify\_status = PDKIM\_VERIFY\_FAIL;
839 sig->verify\_ext\_status = PDKIM\_VERIFY\_FAIL\_BODY;
840 }
841 }
842 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, at line 826, sig->bodyhash.data is attacker-controlled
(through a "DKIM-Signature:" mail header) and memcmp() is called without
checking first that sig->bodyhash.len is equal to b->bh.len: memcmp()
can read sig->bodyhash.data out-of-bounds.
If the acl\_smtp\_dkim is set (it is unset by default), an unauthenticated
remote attacker may transform this vulnerability into an information
disclosure; we have not fully explored this possibility.
