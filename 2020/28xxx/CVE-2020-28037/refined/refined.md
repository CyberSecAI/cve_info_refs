{
  "CVE-2020-28037": {
    "Description": "is_blog_installed in wp-includes/functions.php in WordPress before 5.5.2 improperly determines whether WordPress is already installed, which might allow an attacker to perform a new installation, leading to remote code execution (as well as a denial of service for the old installation).",
    "Root cause": "The `is_blog_installed` function in `wp-includes/functions.php` incorrectly determines if WordPress is installed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper check for existing WordPress installation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass the check and perform a new installation, leading to remote code execution and denial of service for the existing installation.",
    "Attack vectors": "By exploiting the flawed logic in `is_blog_installed`, an attacker can trigger a new WordPress installation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a request that exploits the flawed `is_blog_installed` function to trigger the new installation process, which can happen if the attacker has network access to the WordPress installation."
