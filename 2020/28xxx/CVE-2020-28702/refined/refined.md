Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `$` symbol is used in the SQL statement which directly embeds user input.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code uses string concatenation to build the SQL query, making it vulnerable to manipulation by an attacker.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing them to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. In this case, it's demonstrated by the ability to bypass the search functionality constraints by injecting `1=1--`

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **User Input:** The attack vector is the search functionality of the application. The user-controlled input field, where the user enters search keywords, is vulnerable.
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable parameter is passed in the HTTP GET request through the `keyword` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send crafted HTTP requests.
    *   **Knowledge of the application:** The attacker needs to know the search functionality exists, and understand the application behavior.
    *   **Ability to craft SQL Injection Payloads:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax and be able to craft malicious SQL queries.
