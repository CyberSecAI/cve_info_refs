Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28374:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2020-28374. Multiple sources, including the CVE description from GitHub, mailing list discussions, and NetApp's advisory, confirm that the vulnerability is related to an issue in the Linux SCSI target (LIO) implementation regarding "EXTENDED COPY" (XCOPY) requests.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient Identifier Checking:** The core issue lies in how the LIO SCSI target (specifically in `target_core_xcopy.c`) handles XCOPY requests, which allows for unrestricted copy offloads. The function `target_xcopy_locate_se_dev_e4()` iterates through all configured LIO backstores instead of only the ones accessible to the initiator via transport settings. This means that an attacker can use a valid identifier for their LUN to target other LUNs within the system.
*  **tcmu-runner Vulnerability**: A similar vulnerability exists in the `tcmu-runner` which iterates over all tcmu-runner devices during XCOPY operations without respecting transport restrictions, allowing attackers to read/write to any other device managed by the same `tcmu-runner` instance.
*  **NAA IEEE identifier weakness:** The 100-bit trailer of the NAA identifier is derived from the backstore's `vpd_unit_serial`, which is not considered a secret and, by default, is readable by any local user.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request, essentially granting control over file access.
*   **Unrestricted Copy Offload:** An attacker can initiate copy operations from/to any LIO backstore, regardless of configured SCSI transport settings.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The LIO target code does not properly enforce access control during XCOPY operations.
*  **Missing transport restrictions:** Both LIO and `tcmu-runner` lack proper restrictions during XCOPY operations, which allows access to non-authorized backstores.
*   **Identifier Predictability:** The 100-bit trailer of NAA IEEE identifiers is derived from the backstore's `vpd_unit_serial` and is readble by any user. Also `vpd_unit_serial` itself is not being validated which allows attacker to create predictable or truncated NAA IDs

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker with access to one LUN can read data from any other LIO backstore on the same system, including those not exposed through the same transport.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker can write arbitrary data to any LIO backstore on the system, potentially leading to corruption, denial of service, or further exploitation.
*   **Multi-tenancy breach:** In a multi-tenant vhost-scsi environment, a malicious guest can read or write to images belonging to other VMs.
*   **Isolation Bypass:** CHAP, ACL, and network portal isolation can be bypassed when using iSCSI.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation (iSCSI):** An attacker with network access to an iSCSI LUN can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   **Local Exploitation (vhost-scsi):** An attacker with access to a LUN in a multi-tenant vhost-scsi environment can use this exploit.
*   **General LIO Exploitation:** Any system using LIO and exposing a LUN via a transport like iSCSI is potentially vulnerable if XCOPY is enabled, regardless of whether the system is using iSCSI, and potentially other SCSI transport protocols supported by LIO.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a LUN:** The attacker needs access to at least one LUN exposed via the LIO SCSI target.
*   **Knowledge of Unit Serial Numbers:** The attacker needs to know the Unit Serial Number (vpd_unit_serial or "wwn") of the targeted backstore.
    *   This information is not generally considered secret.
    *   The default LIO configurations allow local users to read the `vpd_unit_serial` via ConfigFS.
    *   The `vpd_unit_serial` can be set through targetcli utility which generates UUIDs as default for the wwn, which implies 100-bit of random data. However, this can be overridden with a predictable `wwn` argument passed to the targetcli.
*   **Ability to send XCOPY requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send SCSI XCOPY requests to the target.

**7. Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Linux kernel v3.12 and later, and tcmu-runner v1.3.0 and later.
*   **Fixes:** Kernel patches have been released for the mainline and stable repositories. The `tcmu-runner` fix involves preventing cross-device copy operations and was assigned a different CVE identifier.
*  **Mitigation:**
   *   Kernel: Disable XCOPY emulation by setting  `emulate_3pc=0` for LIO backstores.
   *   tcmu-runner:  Disabling cross-device copy support as no current authorization logic exists.
*  **NetApp Products:** Multiple NetApp products were found to be vulnerable, such as NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).

**In summary, CVE-2020-28374 is a high-severity vulnerability in the Linux kernelâ€™s LIO SCSI target that allows an attacker to bypass access controls and perform unauthorized read/write operations on various LUNs within the system, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial-of-service attacks.**
