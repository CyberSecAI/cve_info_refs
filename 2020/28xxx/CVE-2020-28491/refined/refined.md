Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-28491:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `CBORParser._finishBytes()` method in the `jackson-dataformat-cbor` library accepts an unchecked length value from the CBOR input during parsing. This length is then used to allocate a byte buffer.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

*   **Unchecked Buffer Allocation:** The parser doesn't validate the size of the declared length for a byte string, which can be controlled by an attacker through a crafted CBOR input.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` exception by providing an extremely large length value, leading to excessive memory allocation and a crash of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** Successful exploitation results in a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` exception and the application crashing, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Service Downtime**: The application or service using the library becomes unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious CBOR Payload:** The attacker can craft a malicious CBOR input that specifies an extremely large length for a byte string.
*   **Network or Input Stream:** The crafted payload is passed to the vulnerable application through network or file input streams processed by the CBOR parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply input to an application parsing CBOR data using the vulnerable library.
*   **No authentication required:**  No special authentication or privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `CBORParser._finishBytes()` method in versions prior to 2.11.4 and between 2.12.0-rc1 and 2.12.1.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```java
    protected byte[] _finishBytes(int len) throws IOException
    {
        if (len >= 0) {
            if (len == 0) {
                return NO_BYTES;
            }
            byte[] b = new byte[len];     <-- OutOfMemoryError here if len is large
        ...
    }
    ```
*   A specific example of a malicious payload is given: `d9d9f7a35a7ffffffff7d9f7f759f7f7f7`.  This payload leads to the parser trying to allocate a buffer of 2147483647 bytes, which will cause an `OutOfMemoryError`.

**Mitigation:**

*   The fix involves adding a check on the length of the byte string before allocation, avoiding an attempt to allocate an extremely large buffer. The fix was implemented in commit `de072d314af8f5f269c8abec6930652af67bc8e6`
*   The fix also includes a limit on the longest non-chunked binary to 250,000, and for larger binaries it will be handled using streaming via `ByteArrayBuilder`.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability caused by insufficient input validation. The fix introduced a maximum length check, addressing the vulnerability.
