Response:
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a command injection in the `cmd_subsys.php` script, specifically related to the `component_dir` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection vulnerability in `cmd_subsys.php`",
    "Lack of proper sanitization of the `component_dir` parameter before using it in a shell command execution."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve privilege escalation from the `apache` user to the `nagios` user by injecting arbitrary shell commands.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the `component_dir` parameter in a request to `cmd_subsys.php`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Nagios Fusion server and be able to exploit an authenticated RCE vulnerability (such as CVE-2020-28905) to gain the ability to run php code as the apache user on the server."
