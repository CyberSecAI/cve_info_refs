  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Vulnerable password hashing implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The system doesn't limit the maximum length of accepted passwords.",
      "The password hashing process becomes CPU and memory intensive when processing extremely long passwords"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, potentially leading to the website becoming unavailable or unresponsive.",
    "attack_vector": "Sending a very long password (e.g., 1,000,000 characters) to the server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to send a crafted request with the long password."
