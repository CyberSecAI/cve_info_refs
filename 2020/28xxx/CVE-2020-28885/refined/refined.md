The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Liferay Portal, both of which allow for Remote Code Execution (RCE) through the execution of OS commands. However, these vulnerabilities are not related to CVE-2020-28885 which is a placeholder.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** The Groovy Script engine allows administrators to execute arbitrary code, including OS commands, via the Script Console. The script engine lacks sufficient restrictions to prevent OS command execution.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization/validation, unrestricted access to the underlying system via Groovy scripts.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with admin privileges can execute arbitrary OS commands, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Accessing the Script Console through the Liferay admin panel and injecting malicious Groovy script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Administrator level privileges within the Liferay portal.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** The Gogo Shell module allows administrators to execute commands, which are not limited to pre-defined module framework commands. This allows for execution of arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient command validation/filtering, unrestricted access to OS commands through the Gogo shell.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with admin privileges can execute arbitrary OS commands, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Accessing the Gogo Shell module through the Liferay admin panel and inputting malicious OS commands.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Administrator level privileges within the Liferay portal.

The article mentions the vulnerabilities were tested on Liferay Portal CE 7.3.5 GA6 and Liferay Portal CE 7.2.0 GA1.
