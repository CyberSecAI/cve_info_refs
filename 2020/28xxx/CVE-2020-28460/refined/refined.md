  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-28460",
    "description": "The multi-ini package before 2.1.2 for Node.js allows prototype pollution. It is possible to pollute an object's prototype by specifying the `constructor.proto` object as part of an array. This is a bypass of CVE-2020-28448.",
    "affected_component": "multi-ini npm package",
    "affected_versions": "<2.1.2",
    "root_cause": "The package is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. By specifying `constructor.proto` as part of an array, it's possible to pollute an object's prototype. This is due to unsafe handling of object properties during parsing.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to:\n  - Denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions.\n  - Tampering with application source code to force code paths, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.\n  - Property injection to modify application behavior, including security properties.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious INI file that includes `constructor.prototype` as an object key to pollute the prototype of all objects."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted .ini file that is read by the vulnerable multi-ini parser.",

             "description": "The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack. The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user. An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. There is some loss of confidentiality. Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. "
