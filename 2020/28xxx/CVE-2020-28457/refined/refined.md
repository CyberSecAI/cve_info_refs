Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-28457:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found within the admin dashboard search functionality of the s-cart/core package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input (specifically, the `keyword` parameter in the URL) before rendering it in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the search parameter. When a victim accesses the crafted URL, the attacker's script will be executed in the victim's browser, allowing for actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    - Exposing sensitive information.
    - Gaining access to privileged services.
    - Delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing the malicious script within the `keyword` parameter.
    - Example: `[host]/sc_admin/order?keyword=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to lure a victim to click the malicious URL (or use another technique to make the user visit the malicious URL).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `core/src/Admin/Controllers/AdminOrderController.php#index` file.
- The fix involves using `htmlentities()` to encode user inputs in files `app/Plugins/Cms/Content/Admin/CmsCategoryController.php` and `app/Plugins/Cms/Content/Admin/CmsContentController.php`

The Snyk vulnerability report provides additional information:
-  Snyk assigns the vulnerability a severity score of 7.2 (High) using CVSS v3.1.
- The vulnerability has a low attack complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction is required for exploitation, and the scope is changed because it can impact resources beyond the security scope.
- The vulnerability can affect web servers, application servers and web application environments.
-  The recommended fix is to upgrade to `s-cart/core` version 4.4 or higher.

The github commit provides the code changes that were implemented to address this vulnerability.
