{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The password reset functionality uses a predictable seed in the hash generation process, which is based on the system time and the login name (email address).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Predictable seed in PRNG, inadequate password reset token generation, lack of lockout on password reset attempts, user ID enumeration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can reset the password of any user account on the system, gaining full access to the account.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed through the password reset functionality by predicting the token and using it to change the password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know a valid user's email address, and they need to be able to initiate the password reset functionality. They need to be able to trigger an update to the 'reset_password_timestamp' and possess the ability to calculate/predict the password reset token using the known components of the token generation process. The attacker can also brute-force the sequential user IDs, and verify their existence via user enumeration."
