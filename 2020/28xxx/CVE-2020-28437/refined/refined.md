{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a command injection in the `lib/get.js` file, which is used by `index.js`. The `heroku-env` package parses the `DATABASE_URL` from Heroku config and splits it into environment variables, but it fails to sanitize the input, allowing for command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection (CWE-78)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the application, potentially leading to a complete loss of confidentiality and integrity. The availability of the service may be also impacted.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network, without requiring any prior authentication or user interaction.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the vulnerable system prior to the attack. They can send malicious input via the `DATABASE_URL` to trigger command injection."
