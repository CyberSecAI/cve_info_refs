KL-001-2020-008 : Barco wePresent Global Hardcoded Root SSH Password
Title: Barco wePresent Global Hardcoded Root SSH Password
Advisory ID: KL-001-2020-008
Publication Date: 2020.11.20
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-008.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: Barco
Affected Product: wePresent WiPG-1600W
Affected Version: 2.5.1.8, 2.5.0.25, 2.5.0.24, 2.4.1.19
Platform: Embedded Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
CVE ID: CVE-2020-28334
2. Vulnerability Description
The Barco wePresent device has a hardcoded root password hash
included in the firmware image. To our knowledge the password
hash has not been cracked and published; it is possible this
could occur at any time. This combined with KL-001-2020-004
(CVE-2020-28329), KL-001-2020-005 (CVE-2020-28330), and
KL-001-2020-007 (CVE-2020-28331) could be used in a simple
and automated exploit chain to go from unauthenticated remote
attacker to root shell.
3. Technical Description
In looking at the unpacked firmware, a root hash was quickly
identified in the /etc/shadow file on the device. It is the
only account in the /etc/shadow. The device does not prompt
the administrator to set a new root password, therefore this
password is hardcoded and exists across all devices.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
The vendor has released an updated firmware (2.5.3.12) which
remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
notes are available at:
https://www.barco.com/en/support/software/R33050104
