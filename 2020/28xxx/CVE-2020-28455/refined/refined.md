Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28455:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `markdown-it-toc` package does not properly escape the title of the generated table of contents (toc) and the contents of the headers. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it doesn't sanitize user-provided input when generating the table of contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the user's browser.
*   Potential consequences include:
    *   Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    *   Exposing sensitive information.
    *   Gaining access to privileged services and functionality.
    *   Delivering malware.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a markdown input with malicious code in the header or the table of contents title. The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how injecting `<head">alert(2)` into a header allows execution of the javascript alert.
*   The attack vector is through the rendering of markdown content by the vulnerable application/system, without any user interaction necessary.
*  The content suggests the attack vector is via the network, as the vulnerability is present in a package being used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted markdown input to an application using the vulnerable `markdown-it-toc` package.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `markdown-it-toc` package.
*   There is no fixed version for this vulnerability yet.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a reflected XSS, as the malicious code is rendered back to the user via the application parsing the crafted markdown input.
*   Snyk's CVSS score is 7.3 (High), while NVD's CVSS is 6.1 (Medium).
