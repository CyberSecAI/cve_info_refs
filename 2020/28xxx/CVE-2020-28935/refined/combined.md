Package        : unbound1.9
Version        : 1.9.0-2+deb10u2~deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12662 CVE-2020-12663 CVE-2020-28935
Debian Bug     : 977165

Several security vulnerabilities have been corrected in unbound, a
validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. Support for the unbound DNS server
has been resumed, the sources can be found in the unbound1.9 source package.

CVE-2020-12662

    Unbound has Insufficient Control of Network Message
    Volume, aka an "NXNSAttack" issue. This is triggered by random
    subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records.

CVE-2020-12663

    Unbound has an infinite loop via malformed DNS answers received from
    upstream servers.

CVE-2020-28935

    Unbound contains a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink
    attack. When writing the PID file Unbound creates the file if it is not
    there, or opens an existing file for writing. In case the file was already
    present, it would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink
    instead of a regular file.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.9.0-2+deb10u2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your unbound1.9 packages.

For the detailed security status of unbound1.9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/unbound1.9>

=== Content from www.nlnetlabs.nl_936df19a_20250119_115605.html ===
The CVE number for this vulnerability is CVE-2020-28935.
== Summary
Unbound and NSD when writing the PID file would not check if an existing file
was a symlink. This could allow for a local symlink attack if an attacker has
access to the user Unbound/NSD runs as.
== Affected products
Unbound up to and including 1.12.0.
NSD up to and including 4.3.3.
== Description
When writing the PID file, Unbound and NSD create the file if it is not
there, or open an existing file for writing. In case the file was already
present, they would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink
instead of a regular file.
An additional chown of the file would then take place after it was written,
making the user Unbound/NSD is supposed to run as the new owner of the file.
If an attacker has local access to the user Unbound/NSD runs as, she could
create a symlink in place of the PID file pointing to a file that she would
like to erase. If then Unbound/NSD is killed and the PID file is not cleared,
upon restarting with root privileges, Unbound/NSD will rewrite any file pointed
at by the symlink.
This is a local vulnerability that could create a Denial of Service of the
system Unbound/NSD is running on. It requires an attacker having access to the
limited permission user Unbound/NSD runs as and point through the symlink to a
critical file on the system.
== Solution
Download patched version of Unbound (1.13.0) and/or NSD (4.3.4), or apply the
patches manually.
+ Unbound
Unbound 1.13.0 is going to be released including the patch.
The patch is:
https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/patch\_cve-2020-28935\_unbound.diff
and can be applied to versions 1.6.6 up until 1.12.0.
Apply the patch containing the fix using:
'patch -p1 < patch\_cve-2020-28935\_unbound.diff'
then run 'make install' to install Unbound.
+ NSD
NSD 4.3.4 is going to be released including the patch.
The patch is:
https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/nsd/patch\_cve-2020-28935\_nsd.diff
and can be applied to versions 4.2.3 up until 4.3.3.
Apply the patch containing the fix using:
'patch -p1 < patch\_cve-2020-28935\_nsd.diff'
then run 'make install' to install NSD.
== Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Mason Loring Bliss for bringing the issue to our attention.

Package        : unbound
Version        : 1.9.0-2+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-28935 CVE-2022-3204 CVE-2022-30698 CVE-2022-30699
Debian Bug     : 1016493 977165

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in unbound, a validating,
recursive, caching DNS resolver.

CVE-2022-3204

 A vulnerability named 'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack' (NRDelegation
 Attack) has been discovered in various DNS resolving software. The
 NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a
 considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts by
 querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive
 nameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of
 time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point where a
 considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can trigger high
 CPU usage in some resolver implementations that continually look in the
 cache for resolved NS records in that delegation. This can lead to degraded
 performance and eventually denial of service in orchestrated attacks.
 Unbound does not suffer from high CPU usage, but resources are still needed
 for resolving the malicious delegation. Unbound will keep trying to resolve
 the record until hard limits are reached. Based on the nature of the attack
 and the replies, different limits could be reached. From now on Unbound
 introduces fixes for better performance when under load, by cutting
 opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and
 limiting the number of times a delegation point can issue a cache lookup
 for missing records.

CVE-2022-30698 and CVE-2022-30699

 Unbound is vulnerable to a novel type of the "ghost domain names" attack.
 The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance.
 Unbound is queried for a rogue domain name when the cached delegation
 information is about to expire. The rogue nameserver delays the response so
 that the cached delegation information is expired. Upon receiving the
 delayed answer containing the delegation information, Unbound overwrites
 the now expired entries. This action can be repeated when the delegation
 information is about to expire making the rogue delegation information
 ever-updating. From now on Unbound stores the start time for a query and
 uses that to decide if the cached delegation information can be
 overwritten.

CVE-2020-28935

 Unbound contains a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink
 attack.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.9.0-2+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.

For the detailed security status of unbound please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/unbound>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
