  "cveId": "CVE-2020-28935",
  "description": "Unbound contains a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink attack. When writing the PID file Unbound creates the file if it is not there, or opens an existing file for writing. In case the file was already present, it would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink instead of a regular file.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Unbound and NSD do not check if an existing PID file is a symbolic link before writing to it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Symbolic Link Following",
      "Inadequate File System Permissions Checks"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system leading to a Denial of Service.",
    "attackVectors": "Local access to the user the Unbound/NSD process runs as.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create a symlink at the location where the PID file is stored. They also need to have local access to the user that the Unbound/NSD process is running as."
