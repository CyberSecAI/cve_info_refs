The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28938.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically in the handling of HTML tags and JavaScript events. While the application has a whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attempts to filter out JavaScript events, these measures can be bypassed using a crafted payload in an `<a>` tag with a `javascript:` URI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the filtering mechanisms for javascript events and HTML tags can be bypassed via a `javascript:` URI within the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with lower-level administrative privileges (e.g., Administrative user role) can inject malicious XSS payloads into various fields like patient medical records. If an administrator views this data, the injected JavaScript can be executed in their browser context allowing the attacker to gain full administrator privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** The XSS vulnerability can be used to force actions on behalf of a victim user if the victim interacts with the malicious link.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** The XSS payload must be triggered by another user (e.g., an administrator) clicking on a malicious link to escalate privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Administrative or Administrator Role:**  An attacker needs to have the "Administrative" or "Administrator" role in the application to insert the XSS payload.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker requires a victim, specifically an administrator, to view the content containing the malicious XSS payload.
