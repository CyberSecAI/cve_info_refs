Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28190:

**Root Cause:**

*   The software update mechanism for TerraMaster TOS uses unencrypted HTTP communication channels to check for and deliver updates and applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Communication:** The lack of encryption (HTTPS) when fetching updates and applications makes the communication susceptible to eavesdropping and tampering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the NAS device and the update server can intercept the communication.
*   **Malicious Updates/Application Installation:** By intercepting the unencrypted communication, an attacker can inject malicious updates or applications, leading to:
    *   Compromise of the NAS device.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Installation of backdoors.
    *   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based MitM:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable NAS device or be able to intercept its network traffic. This could involve:
    *   Being on the same local network (e.g., Wi-Fi).
    *   Compromising a router or other network device in the path of the traffic.
    *   DNS spoofing to redirect the update requests to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the TerraMaster NAS device and its update server.
*   **Knowledge of Update Mechanism:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the URL used to retrieve updates, to be able to substitute malicious content.

**Additional details:**
* The advisory mentions the specific URL `http:\/\/dl.terra-master.com\/cn\/TOS7.0CJ\/AmazonS3.bz2` as an example of an insecure update location.
* The vendor was notified on Nov 2nd, 2020 and released a fix in version 4.2.07 on Dec 3rd, 2020

This analysis provides more detail than the standard CVE description by detailing the exact attack vector, the capabilities of the attacker and provides a specific example of the insecure URL used.
