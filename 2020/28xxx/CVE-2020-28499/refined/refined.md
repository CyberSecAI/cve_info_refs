Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28499:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an unsafe recursive merge function (`_recursiveMerge`) within the `merge` library. This function doesn't properly sanitize input during object merging, making it vulnerable to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution. By injecting a `__proto__` property into the source object during the merge operation, an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype`. This can lead to unintended behavior in JavaScript applications.
- **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The recursive merge function fails to handle the `__proto__` property correctly. It recurses into the prototype chain when it should be sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values (e.g., an integer instead of a function), the application may fail or become unstable, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates attributes of an object, such as using `eval(someobject.someattr)`, an attacker can inject malicious code via prototype pollution and achieve RCE.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary properties and values into objects that are then used by the application, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption (e.g. injecting an `isAdmin` property).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered via the `_recursiveMerge` function when merging objects.
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious source object containing a `__proto__` property to the merge function.
- This attack vector is network based.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the vulnerable `merge` function, specifically the source object being merged. This can occur in a number of ways, including but not limited to:
    - Directly supplying data through API requests
    - Indirectly through user-controlled data.
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities to manipulate the merge operation.

**Additional Details:**

* **Affected Library:** The vulnerability affects the `merge` npm package and `org.webjars.npm:merge` webjar package, versions prior to 2.1.1.
* **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC code demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the prototype using a crafted JSON payload containing the `__proto__` property and then merge it with an existing object using the `merge.recursive` function. This modifies the prototype of all objects in the application.
* **Fix:** The recommended fix is to upgrade the `merge` package to version 2.1.1 or higher. This version contains a patch that prevents prototype pollution.
