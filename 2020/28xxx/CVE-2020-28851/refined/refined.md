Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a panic within the `language.ParseAcceptLanguage` function in the `golang.org/x/text` library when parsing a language tag with a `-u-` extension. Specifically, the issue is an "index out of range" error in the `Tag.findTypeForKey` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of `-u-` extension in language tags during parsing
- Potential for out-of-bounds access, leading to a panic
- Lack of error handling in the `language.ParseAcceptLanguage` function
- Usage of a vulnerable version of the `golang.org/x/text` library (v0.3.4)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to the program crashing with a panic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `Accept-Language` header with a `-u-` extension to an application that uses the vulnerable `golang.org/x/text` library to parse it.
- The `language.ParseAcceptLanguage` function is called when handling the `Accept-Language` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a controllable `Accept-Language` header or otherwise provide input to the `language.ParseAcceptLanguage` function
- No special privileges are needed, as the vulnerability can be triggered by any input processed by the affected function.

**Additional details from the github issue:**
- The vulnerability was reported with go version 1.15.4.
- The specific code that triggers the vulnerability is provided in a Go playground link.
- The panic occurs specifically within the `golang.org/x/text/internal/language/language.go` file at line 456, within the `Tag.findTypeForKey` method.
- This issue has been labeled with "FrozenDueToAge" and "NeedsInvestigation," suggesting that it has not been actively addressed.
- The vulnerable library is `golang.org/x/text@v0.3.4`.
