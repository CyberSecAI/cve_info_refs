Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `corenlp-js-prefab` package. The `process` function takes user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands through the `process` function of the package. This is a classic example of CWE-78, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Total Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable application is running. This could lead to:
    - **Confidentiality breach:** Access to sensitive data.
    - **Integrity compromise:** Modification of files and system configuration.
    - **Availability disruption:** Denial of service or system shutdown.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to execute arbitrary commands allows for complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing local access.
- **No user interaction required:** The vulnerability is triggered directly by providing crafted input to the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic Understanding of Command Injection:** The attacker must craft a command injection payload using standard techniques for OS command injection.

**Additional Details:**
- **Proof of Concept:** Snyk provides a simple proof of concept: `a.process("') touch JHU # '");` demonstrating how to inject the `touch` command. This is more detailed than the standard CVE description, which would not include the example.
- **CVSS Score:** Snyk and NVD both assign a critical CVSS score of 9.8, reflecting the high severity of this vulnerability.
- **No Fix Available:** The package is deprecated and there is no fixed version available.
