Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the OpenAsset Digital Asset Management software. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code through various parameters, which is then reflected back to the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in multiple areas of the application.
    - Account recovery/password reset page via the `email` parameter.
    - Saved search request via the `id` parameter.
    - Search result request via the `imageViewId` and `lpFilterInputId` parameters.
- The application fails to sanitize or encode user input before reflecting it back to the user's browser, allowing for the execution of arbitrary client-side code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML in the context of a user's session within the vulnerable application.
- This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Account compromise
    - Phishing attacks
    - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user
    - Defacement or redirection of the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can inject malicious code through crafted URLs or through manipulating parameters in forms.
- The attack is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link or visits a compromised webpage containing the malicious input, leading to the execution of the attacker's script in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the payload.
- The attacker must also be able to entice a user into clicking on the malicious link, thus triggering the vulnerability. This could be via email, messaging, or social engineering.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jack Misiura on behalf of The Missing Link Security.
- The vulnerability affects both cloud and on-premise versions of OpenAsset.
- Affected versions: 12.0.19 (Cloud), 11.2.1 (On-Premise).
- Fixed versions: 12.0.22 (Cloud), 11.4.10 (On-Premise).
