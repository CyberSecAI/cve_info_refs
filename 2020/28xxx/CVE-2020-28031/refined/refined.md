Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Eramba application was not properly validating the HTTP Host header in requests. This allowed an attacker to inject a malicious host header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Host Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the HTTP Host header, which allows for the injection of arbitrary hostnames.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The injected host header was used by the application when building requests, which could lead to the application making requests to external or internal services controlled by the attacker. In this specific case, the attacker was able to make the application generate a PDF using wkhtml2pdf with a malicious host header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential SSRF:** By injecting a malicious host header, an attacker could potentially force the Eramba server to make requests to arbitrary locations.
*  **PDF Generation with attacker-controlled content:**  The attacker could force the application to print PDF files using wkhtml2pdf based on the injected host, including content from attacker-controlled servers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests with a malicious Host header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Eramba Account:** The exploit requires the attacker to have a valid user account in the Eramba application. This means an unauthenticated user cannot exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Eramba server.
