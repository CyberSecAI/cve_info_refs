Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28139 (though the exploit-db entry does not specify a CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application suffers from a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the "Offer Detail" field in the `Offers.php` page doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Persistent XSS:** The XSS vulnerability is stored in the database. The malicious script is injected and stored, then executed each time a user visits the affected page.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-provided input in the "Offer Detail" field, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit the `Offers.php` page, which can lead to:
    *   **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can steal the user's session cookies (as shown in the example payload provided `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`).
    *   **Account Hijacking:** By stealing cookies, an attacker can potentially impersonate the user and gain access to their account.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could inject malicious code that redirects to a malware site.
    *   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could alter the content of the website.
    *   **Other malicious activities:** An attacker can perform other malicious activities, potentially impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of the "Online Clothing Store" application.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The specific parameter is the "Offer Detail" field within the `Offers.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Admin Access:** An attacker needs to have admin-level privileges in order to add an offer with a malicious script.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Page/Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable page (`Offers.php`) and the vulnerable parameter ("Offer Detail").

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit-db entry indicates that the vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the Online Clothing Store application.
*   The application is developed using PHP, HTML, MySQLi, and JavaScript.
*   The XSS vulnerability is a stored (persistent) XSS, which makes it more dangerous because the malicious script is stored in the application's database and executed each time the affected page is accessed.
