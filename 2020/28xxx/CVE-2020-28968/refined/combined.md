Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the official Draytek VigorAP product series application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.
The persistent input validation web vulnerability is located in the username input field of the RADIUS Setting - RADIUS Server
Configuration module. Remote attackers with limited access are able to inject own malicious persistent script codes as username.
Other privileged user accounts execute on preview of the modules context. The request method to inject is POST and the attack
vector is located on the application-side.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] RADIUS Setting - RADIUS Server Configuration - Users Profile
Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Username
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and low user interaction.
