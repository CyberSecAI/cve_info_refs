Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-28915:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `fbcon_get_font()` function within the Linux kernel's framebuffer console driver (`fbdev`). This function retrieves font data for use by the console. The core issue is that it reads past the bounds of the buffer holding font data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `fbcon_get_font()` function does not perform proper bounds checking when copying font data, particularly with respect to the `vc->vc_font.height`.
- **Unreliable size checking:** The `struct console_font` does not contain the size, `FONTDATAMAX`, for built-in fonts. This makes it difficult to perform a reliable size check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Information Leak:** An attacker can trigger a read beyond the allocated memory range, potentially leading to an information leak of kernel memory.
- **Kernel Crash:** If the out-of-bounds read accesses an unmapped memory location, this could cause the kernel to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted ioctl request to the `/dev/tty*` devices, specifically through `do_fontx_ioctl()` call. The attacker can influence the `vc->vc_font.height` parameter, causing the out of bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to call `ioctl` on a TTY device. This is often possible for a local, unprivileged user.
