Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the `corenlp-js-interface` package. Specifically, the main function of this package is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application is vulnerable to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can lead to a total loss of confidentiality (all resources divulged to the attacker), integrity (attacker can modify files), and availability (attacker can deny access to resources). This could result in a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any interaction from the user.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The exploit is easily achievable, without any specialized access conditions or circumstances.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject commands using the main function of the package, which is susceptible to command injection.
- The package is deprecated and has no fixed version.
- Snyk has assigned the ID `SNYK-JS-CORENLPJSINTERFACE-1050435` to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical).
- Snyk threat intelligence indicates a proof-of-concept exists, and an EPSS score of 0.37% (73rd percentile) suggest some level of threat exploitation.
