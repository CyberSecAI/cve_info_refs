  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `set` function in `total.js` does not properly sanitize the keys of the path being set, leading to a prototype pollution vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution: The ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects, via manipulation of `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` attributes."
    ],
    "impact": "Depending on the application, exploitation can lead to Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or Property Injection.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By controlling the 'path' value in the `set` function, an attacker can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`, allowing them to modify the prototype of the base object and pollute all the JavaScript objects that inherit from it."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the 'path' argument passed to the vulnerable `set` function.",
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from how the `set` function handles the path parameter. When setting a value based on a path, it doesn't sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject properties onto the base object prototype by using  `__proto__` in the path string, which will affect all objects."
