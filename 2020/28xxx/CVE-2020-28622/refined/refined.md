The provided content contains information about CVE-2020-28622.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper index validation when parsing Nef polygon files. The code reads indices from the input file and uses them directly to access vectors of object handles without checking if the indices are within the valid bounds. This allows an attacker to provide arbitrary indices that lead to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking on indices read from the input file before using them to access vector elements. This results in out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in multiple functions across different Nef polygon parsing implementations (Nef_2, Nef_3, and Nef_S2). Specifically, CVE-2020-28622 is triggered in `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser::read_edge() eh->incident_sface()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to out-of-bounds reads and type confusion, which in turn can lead to arbitrary code execution. The attacker can control the memory locations accessed by providing crafted input files with malicious indices.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is providing a specially crafted, malformed Nef polygon file to be parsed by the vulnerable CGAL library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with a malicious .nef file that contains out-of-bounds indices. No special privileges or specific network positions are required.
