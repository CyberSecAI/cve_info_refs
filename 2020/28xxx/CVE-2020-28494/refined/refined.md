Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of the `type` parameter in the `image.pipe` and `image.stream` functions within the `total.js` framework. This parameter is directly used to construct a command that is then executed using `child_process.spawn` with the `shell` option set to `true`. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application executes untrusted input as part of a system command.
- Use of `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`: This allows arbitrary commands to be executed through the shell.
- Lack of input sanitization: The `type` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in the command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server running the application.
- Confidentiality loss: Attackers can potentially access sensitive data on the server.
- Integrity compromise: Attackers can modify data or files on the server.
- Availability issues: Attackers might cause denial-of-service by disrupting normal operations.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a malicious `type` parameter to the `image.stream` or `image.pipe` functions. This can be achieved by crafting a payload containing shell commands within the `type` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `type` parameter passed to the vulnerable functions. This could be through a network request or any other means that allows modifying or setting this parameter.
- No special privileges are required as the exploit can be done remotely through the network.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of `total.js` prior to 3.4.7.
- The fix involves upgrading `total.js` to version 3.4.7 or higher.
- The Snyk vulnerability ID is `SNYK-JS-TOTALJS-1046672`.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command).
- The CVSS score from Snyk is 8.6 (High).
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The commit fixing the vulnerability is [https://github.com/totaljs/framework/commit/6192491ab2631e7c1d317c221f18ea613e2c18a5](https://github.com/totaljs/framework/commit/6192491ab2631e7c1d317c221f18ea613e2c18a5).

This vulnerability allows for a remote attacker with no privileges required to execute arbitrary shell commands on a server running a vulnerable version of `total.js`.
