Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28424

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `s3-kilatstorage` package uses a bash command to execute `s3cmd`, and it does not properly sanitize user-provided input that's passed to the `makeBucket` function. This allows for command injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands within the `makeBucket` function's parameter, which are then executed by the system.
    
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the application using `s3-kilatstorage` is running. This could lead to:
        *   Data exfiltration
        *   System compromise
        *   Denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious string as input to the `makeBucket` function. For instance, using a payload like `& touch JHU #` will create an empty file named `JHU` in the directory where the application is being run.
    *   The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and can be exploited remotely

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need any prior privileges or special access to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to control input to the makeBucket function.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the `s3-kilatstorage` package, and there is no fixed version available.
*   Snyk has provided a proof-of-concept exploit.
*   The CVSS score from Snyk is 7.2 (High), while NVD assigns a 9.8 (Critical).

**Summary:**

The `s3-kilatstorage` package is vulnerable to a command injection flaw due to the lack of sanitization of user-provided input within the `makeBucket` function. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, potentially compromising the server.
