{
  "CVE-2020-28214": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt (CWE-760)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can pre-compute the hash value using a dictionary attack, effectively disabling the protection that an unpredictable salt would provide, leading to potential unauthorized access.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access with low privileges (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system and low privileges."
  }
