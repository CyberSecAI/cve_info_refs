  "CVE-2020-28282": {
    "description": "Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘getobject’ version 0.1.0 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `set()` function in the 'getobject' NPM module lacks validation of the object type before assigning a value to a property. Specifically, it doesn't check if the property being set is part of the object's own properties or is trying to modify the prototype.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Prototype Pollution",
        "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes (CWE-1321)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can create a non-existent property or manipulate an existing one, leading to a denial of service (DoS) and potentially remote code execution (RCE). By polluting the prototype, the attacker can modify the behavior of all objects inheriting from the polluted prototype.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious value to the `parts` argument of the `set()` function. Specifically, by including `__proto__` within the `parts` value, an attacker can target the object's prototype for modification.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters to the `set()` function.",
        "poc_code": "```javascript\nconst getObject = require('getobject');\nvar obj = {};\nconsole.log(\"Before Polluting : \" + obj.isAdmin);\ngetObject.set(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', true);\nconsole.log(\"After Polluting: \" + obj.isAdmin);\n```"

     "affected_environments": [
        "getobject version 0.1.0"

    "prevention": "Upgrade to version 1.0.0 or later.",
