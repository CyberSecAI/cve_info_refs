{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `math/big` package in Go can panic during recursive division of very large numbers when provided with crafted large inputs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Denial of Service",
       "Panic during division of large numbers"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists due to a panic condition, potentially crashing applications or services that rely on the affected Go libraries or packages. Exploitation leads to application crashes and service disruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted input to math/big methods",
       "Crafted public keys and signatures in crypto/rsa and crypto/dsa",
      "Crafted X.509 certificates",
      "Malformed host keys for crypto/ssh"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft specific inputs that trigger the vulnerable code paths. This may include crafting large numbers for division, manipulating public keys or certificate chains, or supplying malformed SSH host keys.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in multiple methods of `math/big.Int` and `math/big.Rat`.  Specifically, methods such as Div, Exp, DivMod, Quo, Rem, QuoRem, Mod, ModInverse, ModSqrt, Jacobi, and GCD in `math/big.Int`, and equivalent methods in `math/big.Rat`, can be triggered with divisors or modulo arguments larger than 3168 bits (on 32-bit architectures) or 6336 bits (on 64-bit architectures). Additionally, `crypto/rsa`, `crypto/dsa`, `crypto/ecdsa`, `crypto/elliptic` and `crypto/x509` operations are also affected by this vulnerability. Furthermore, `golang.org/x/crypto/otr`, `golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp`, and `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` may crash, with different triggers as specified in the text."
