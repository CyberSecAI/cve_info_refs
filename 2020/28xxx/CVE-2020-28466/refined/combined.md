Subject: [CVE-2020-28466][CVE-2021-3127] NATS.io vulnerabilities

Folks,

Two new CVEs for the NATS project for issues fixed with the
2.2.0 release.  The full text of the advisories should be attached.
These, and other advisories, can be found at
<<https://advisories.nats.io/>>.

 * CVE-2020-28466
   + import loops between accounts, expressed in the account JWT, could
     DoS the server
   + this was fixed in public git some time ago without initially
     thinking of the security impact, this was the first
     release since then
   + realistically, the current situation is that if you have untrusted
     third parties with control over their account JWTs, then while
     we'll hurry security releases for severe flaws (compromise,
     disclosure), for DoS protection folks need to follow closer to git
     mainline

 * CVE-2021-3127
   + this one is far more serious: information disclosure between
     accounts
   + something which should have been an error was a disregarded
     warning, letting people reuse binding tokens to bypass access
     controls on data exports from an account because the binding was
     not enforced
   + the bug is in the JWT library, the current NATS server has the fix
     in as as a dependency; the advisory includes a Python script which
     can be pointed at your account server's account pack URL, or a pack
     on local disk, to audit all the accounts to find instances of
     someone exploiting this

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on

#### Introduced: 22 Nov 2020

[CVE-2020-28466  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-28466) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/nats-io/nats-server/server` to version 2.2.0 or higher.

## Overview

[github.com/nats-io/nats-server/server](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server) is an A simple, secure and performant communications system for digital systems, services and devices.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). Untrusted accounts are able to crash the server using configs that represent a service export/import cycles.

### Disclaimer from the maintainers:

Running a NATS service which is exposed to
untrusted users presents a heightened risk. Any remote execution flaw
or equivalent seriousness, or denial-of-service by unauthenticated
users, will lead to prompt releases by the NATS maintainers. Fixes
for denial of service issues with no threat of remote execution, when
limited to account holders, are likely to just be committed to the
main development branch with no special attention. Those who are
running such services are encouraged to build regularly from git.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)
## References

* [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/pull/1731/commits/2e3c22672936f4980d343fb1d328b38919e74796)
* [GitHub PR](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/pull/1731)
### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

Simple configs that represent a service export/import cycle between accounts could crash the server.

LGTM. To be clear, we are not failing this as a misconfiguration now, just make sure we are not cycling, right?

looks like this would trigger if: a importFormsCycle b

a serviceExportOverlaps with c

b serviceImportOverlaps with d

Seems the checks do not take accounts fully into account?

It does take accounts into consideration since it looks at itself first during an import and sees if we have an overlapping export. AFAIK this is required to form any cycle. We then check the destination which is the destination account against the "from" subject to see if it overlaps in the destination account with its imports.

Can a.serviceExportOverlaps(to) return true for a reason that has nothing to do with destination?

Similarly, can destination.serviceImportOverlaps(from) return true for a reason that has nothing to do with a?

On further reflection, I also wonder if we should prevent cycles irrespective of the subjects involved.

Are we doing direct cycles here?

I would have expected a depth first search alternating between exports/imports facilitating a queue to avoid recursion.

Yes we detect direct cycles here, hence the original test with just help and two accounts.

I meant more like only direct cycles (involving 2 accounts) vs all cycles (involving more accounts)

I'd say the above check finds the loop here?

how about A export a, B import a to b and export b, C import b to c to d and export d

Then another test that rewrites subjects via mappings as well.

I have a test with 3 accounts. I could add this one if you feel strongly about it.

Well, if we only detect direct cycles, then a test with 3 accounts - no direct cycle - is not needed.

If we do want to detect cycles between more than two accounts I feel strongly about such a test.

My reading of the above code (importFormsCycle) is that you get an error because of these two accounts alone and so the test does not test what it's supposed to.

I have tests with wildcards and import mappings as well IIRC. But happy to add another test if you feel something is missing.
