Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `parse_fix_phrase()` function within Exim. When called with a specific input (`-F '.('` option), the function attempts to copy a string using `strncpy()` with a negative size parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap buffer overflow:** The `strncpy()` function, when given a negative size, interprets it as a very large unsigned value causing it to write past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The content states that if exploitable, the vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local attacker to obtain full root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local attacker must execute exim with a `-F '.('` command-line option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where Exim is running.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute Exim with the specific command-line option.

**Additional Details:**

- The advisory explains that when `strncpy` is called with `-1` as the size, it is interpreted as a large unsigned value. This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when it writes additional null bytes.
- The vulnerability occurs when the variables `s` and `ss` are both equal to `end`, and then `ss` is decremented. The subsequent calculation `ss-s` results in `-1`.
