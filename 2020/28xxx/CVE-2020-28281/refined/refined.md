Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28281:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a prototype pollution issue in the `set-object-value` NPM module. The `replaceValue()` function within this module does not properly validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The lack of type checking before assigning a value to a property allows an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects. Specifically, by controlling the `arrKey` parameter of the `replaceValue` function, an attacker can set arbitrary properties on the `__proto__` object, leading to prototype pollution.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The function `replaceValue()` doesn't sanitize or validate the `arrKey` and `val` arguments, making it susceptible to malicious input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype, an attacker can cause unexpected behavior and potentially crash the application.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The prototype pollution could be leveraged to achieve remote code execution by manipulating object properties that are used in later code execution. This is described as a potential impact.
- **Bypass Security Checks:** By injecting properties into the prototype, an attacker could potentially bypass security checks that rely on the presence or value of object properties. For example, if code checks `obj.isAdmin` after the prototype has been polluted, the result might be unexpected.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based, meaning that the attacker can send malicious input over the network to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to control input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to the `replaceValue()` function, specifically the `arrKey` and `val` arguments. This would likely involve manipulating data that is used by the application and processed by the vulnerable function.
- **No required privileges or user interaction:** The attacker doesn't need special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects `set-object-value` versions 0.0.0 through 0.0.5.
- **Proof of Concept:** A code snippet is provided demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability by modifying the `__proto__` object.
- **Remediation:** The provided text suggests mitigation strategies such as freezing objects to prevent property changes, validating JSON input, or using `Object.create(null)` to create objects without a prototype. However, no fix version for the vulnerable library exists.
- **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8, indicating critical severity. CVSS v2.0 has a score of 7.5.
