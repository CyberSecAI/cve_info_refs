  "cve": "CVE-2020-28623",
  "description": "Multiple code execution vulnerabilities exists in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL. A specially crafted malformed file can lead to an out-of-bounds read and type confusion, which could lead to code execution. An attacker can provide malicious input to trigger any of these vulnerabilities. An oob read vulnerability exists in Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parser<EW>::read_facet() fh->twin().",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when reading indices from a file and using them to access vectors, leading to out-of-bounds reads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129)",
      "Out-of-bounds Read"
     ],
    "impact": "An out-of-bounds read and type confusion, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted malformed file can be provided as input.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input file to the vulnerable application."
