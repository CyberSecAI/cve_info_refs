**PROJECT: Grocery Store Sales and Inventory System Using PHP/MySQL**

## About The Project

The Grocery Store Sales and Inventory System is a simple PHP project with source code, This Sales and Inventory System  will help grocery stores to manage their inventory stock and monitor their sales daily. The grocery store daily sales will be stored in the system and can be easy to track and be monitored. This simple project will calculate the product stock available for the grocery store automatically so the admin or the owner of the store can check if a certain product needed to be restocked.

The source code itself is easy to customize for any enhancement or modification to cater the daily process of a certain grocery store that is related to their inventory and sales management or also any other process they want to be added to the system.  The Simple Grocery Store Sales and Inventory System have 2 types of user which are the admin and the cashier. The Admin can of can manage all in an aspect of the system and the cashier can only manage the sales and view the inventory for stock monitoring.

## Features

* **Login Page**

  + The page where users will enter their credentials to access the Sales and Inventory System of the store.
* **Home Page**
  + The page where the user will be redirected by default after logging into the system.
* **Category Page**
  + The page where can admin manage the list of product categories of a certain grocery store have.
* **Product Page**
  + The page where the admin can manage all the products of the store in the system.
* **Supplier List Page**
  + The page where all suppliers of the grocery store are listed and can be managed only by the system admin.
* **Customer List Page**
  + The page where all customers of the grocery store are listed and can be managed by admin.
* **Receiving Page**
  + This the page where the admin will encode the grocery store purchases in order to restock a product in inventory and monitoring.
* **Inventory Page**

* **Users Page**
  + The page where  can admin managed all the system users.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the source code and extract the **zip**file.
2. Download or set up any local web server that runs PHP script.
3. Open the web-server database and create a new database name it **sales\_inventory\_db**.
4. Import the **SQL**file located in the database folder of the source code.
5. Copy and paste the source code to the location where your local web server accessing your local projects. Example for XAMPP('C:\xampp\htdocs')
6. Open a web browser and browse the project. E.g [http://localhost/sales-inventory-system-using-php]

## Default Admin Access:

USERNAME: admin

PASSWORD: admin123

The Grocery Store Sales and Invnetory System source code was developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript (jQuery and Ajax) and Bootstrap for the design. In this project, all forms is being submitted using Ajax for better user interaction of the user when using the sales and inventory system.

I hope this simple Grocery Store Sales and Inventory System project will help you with what you are looking for. Feel free to download the source code and enhance or modify it in the way you want.

Enjoy!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
