Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-28133 (Although the exploit-db entry does not list a CVE, it is related to the same software and vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the login functionality of the Simple Grocery Store Sales And Inventory System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the username and password fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting a specific SQL payload (e.g., `jyot' or 1=1#`), an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially gaining admin privileges.
- The system is vulnerable to other SQL injection attacks beyond authentication bypass.
- Data Modification or Exfiltration: If successful, it might be possible to use the SQL injection to modify or steal data from the underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Login Page:** The specific attack vector is through the login page (`login.php`) of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have some understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious payload.
