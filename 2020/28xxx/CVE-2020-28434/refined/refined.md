Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28434:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw located in the `lib/gitblame.js` file of the `gitblame` npm package, specifically on line 15. The `gitblame` package uses `git blame` to identify who modified a file, however, it does not properly sanitize user input passed to the `git blame` command, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application takes user-controlled input and uses it to execute a shell command without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server running the vulnerable application.
- This can lead to a variety of impacts, such as:
    - Data breaches (confidentiality impact - High)
    - System compromise, including modification or deletion of files (integrity impact - High)
    - Denial of service (availability impact - Low), the description mentions reduced performance and interruptions of resource availability but not a complete denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network. An attacker does not need prior access to the system. The vulnerable application is exposed and reachable over the network and can be exploited without any user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges or prior authentication.
- No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send input to the vulnerable application over the network.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Package:** `gitblame` npm package.
- **Vulnerable versions:** All versions are affected. There is no fixed version for this package.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject a command using the `gitblame` function.
- **CVSS Score (Snyk):** 9.4 (Critical)
- **CVSS Score (NVD):** 9.8 (Critical)
- **CWE:** CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('Command Injection'))
- The vulnerability was reported by the JHU System Security Lab.
