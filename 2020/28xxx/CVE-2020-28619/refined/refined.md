  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-28619",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of index validation when reading data from a file, specifically in the `read_edge` function. The code reads an index from the input file and uses it to access elements in the `Edge_of` vector without checking if the index is within the vector's bounds.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read",
         "Type confusion"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read by providing a crafted index in the input file. This can result in a crash, or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution through type confusion by dereferencing memory at attacker-controlled locations.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted malformed file, which is parsed by the vulnerable code.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious input file containing crafted indexes when parsing Nef polygon data. No special position or privilege is required.",
        "details":"Specifically, within the `read_edge` function, the `eh->twin()` member is being assigned an arbitrary memory location by reading a supplied index into the `Edge_of` vector. Later, dereferencing this corrupted memory can lead to code execution."
