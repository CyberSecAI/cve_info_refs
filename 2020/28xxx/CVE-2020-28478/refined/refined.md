Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to prototype pollution in the `gsap` npm package.
*   The library is vulnerable to prototype pollution through the `gsap.config` and `gsap.defaults` functions when parsing JSON input.
*   An attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` using specially crafted JSON containing `__proto__`, allowing them to manipulate all JavaScript objects within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
*   **Unsafe Object Recursive Merge:**  The vulnerability stems from an unsafe recursive merge logic within the library that doesn't properly sanitize or check for `__proto__` properties in the input.
*  **Property definition by path:** The library is vulnerable due to defining properties based on a provided path that does not sanitize `__proto__` properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values (e.g., an integer instead of a function), attackers can trigger JavaScript errors, leading to a DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates attributes of an object (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker might be able to inject malicious code and achieve RCE.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious properties, potentially compromising security-related attributes (e.g., user privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side:** The attack happens through the client-side application, by supplying malicious JSON via the `gsap.config` or `gsap.defaults` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control the JSON input that is parsed by the vulnerable `gsap` library.
*   No special privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to inject malicious JSON.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects `gsap` versions prior to 3.6.0.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject a `polluted` property into the prototype chain using `gsap.config` with a crafted JSON input.
*   The fix involves upgrading `gsap` to version 3.6.0 or higher, which addresses the vulnerability by implementing secure parsing.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a high severity issue with a CVSS score of 7.5, according to both Snyk and NVD.
*   Snyk provides resources and guidance on prototype pollution and preventative measures.
