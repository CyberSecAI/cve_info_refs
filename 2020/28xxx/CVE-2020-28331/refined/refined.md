{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-28331",
    "description": "The Barco wePresent device has an undocumented SSH interface that can be enabled via the web UI by injecting a specific variable into a POST request. This allows an attacker to enable the SSH daemon which is disabled by default.",
    "root_cause": "The web UI does not prevent modification of a configuration file variable (RD_DEBUG_MODE) through a POST request, allowing the attacker to enable the SSH service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-284: Improper Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device via SSH after enabling the service. The root user is available by default although the password hash is not easily cracked.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a POST request to the web UI to modify the RD_DEBUG_MODE variable and then sends another request to reboot the device. After reboot, the SSH daemon starts, and the attacker can connect."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the device and have the ability to intercept or modify the POST data being sent to the device.",
    "additional_details": "The SSH daemon is present in the firmware but disabled by default. The device reads the RD_DEBUG_MODE variable from a configuration file to determine whether to enable the SSH daemon during startup. While the web UI does not provide a setting to enable the SSH daemon, this variable can be manipulated via a POST request to enable the service. The device must then be rebooted to activate the change. The advisory includes a proof of concept showing how to send the necessary HTTP requests to enable the service."
