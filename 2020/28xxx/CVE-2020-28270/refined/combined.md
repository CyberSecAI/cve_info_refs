# CVE-2020-28270

#### Date: November 12, 2020

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘object-hierarchy-access’ versions 0.2.0 through 0.32.0 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module 'object-hiearchy-access' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'set()' did not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.

#### PoC Details

The `set()` accepts arguments `optionalTarget`. Due to the absence of validation, at values passed into `optionalTarget` arguments, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the `optionalTarget`` value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning property to check whether the assigned `optionalTarget` is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as "true" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
const { set } = require('object-hierarchy-access')
var obj ={}
console.log("Before : " + obj.isAdmin);
set({}, ['__proto__', 'isAdmin'], true);
console.log("After : " + obj.isAdmin);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.2.0-0.32.0
#### Prevention

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

# Importing methods

For ES module environment, use `import` to import methods:

```
import { get, set } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
```

For commonjs environment, use `requre` to import methods:

```
const { get, set } = require('object-hierarchy-access')
```

For AMD module environment, define module `object-hierarchy-access` from file `dist/index`.

For global mode, methods are under global variable `ObjectHierarchyAccess`.

# Assigning

## Setting a value

All methods for setting a value below have same parameters definition:

```
setValue(targetObject, ...hierarchyProperties, lastProperty, value);
setValue(targetObject, [...hierarchyProperties, lastProperty], value);
```

### `set`

Set value to object's hierarchy properties, returns the object:

```
import { set } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
set(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c', 100);
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 100
```

Properties could be in arrays:

```
import { set } from 'object-hierarchy-access';

const obj = {};
set(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c'], 100);
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 100

set(obj, ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i'], 200);
console.log(obj.d.e.f.g.h.i); // 200
```

Create root object at the same time:

```
import { set } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = set({}, 'a', 'b', 'c', 100);
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 100
```

### `setIfUndef`

Only set value if last hierarchy property not exists or its value is `undefined`:

```
import { setIfUndef } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
setIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', 'collection', []);
obj.a.b.collection.push(100);
console.log(obj.a.b.collection); // [100]

setIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', 'collection', []); // will not override previous array
obj.a.b.collection.push(200);
console.log(obj.a.b.collection); // [100, 200]
```

It is also possible to create the object at the same time:

```
import { setIfUndef } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = setIfUndef({}, 'a', 'b', 'c', 100);
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 100
```

### Customize hierarchy object creating

Property can ba a descriptor object rather than a primitive value for non-last property item. The descriptor shape is `{name|getName, value|type|create, override?, created?, skipped?, got?}`.

* `name` is a primitive property name
* `getName(parent)` is a callback function to get property name
* `value` should be an object assign to parent object's `name`
* `type` is a constructor function(or class) with no parameter that can be used to create object, assign to parent object's `name`
* `create(parent, name)` is a callback function that returns a customized object assign to `parent` object's `name`
* `override` determines if always create new hierarchy object even property already exists
* `created(parent, name, current)` is a callback function when new hierarchy object has been created
* `skipped(parent, name, current)` is a callback function when hierarchy object already exists and skipped
* `got(parent, name, current)` is a callback function when current hierarchy object got no matter it is created or skipped.

Property can also be a function, it just act as `getName` callback in object descriptor.

If no *name* related option specified, property name will be `undefined`.

If no *value* related option specified, value will be `{}`.

```
const obj = set({}, 'a', {name: 'b', value: []}, '0', 100);
console.log(obj); // {a: {b: [100]}}

const obj2 = set({}, 'a', {name: 'b', value: {}}, 'c', 100);
console.log(obj2); // {a: {b: {c: 100}}
```

```
const obj = set({}, 'a', {name: 'b', type: Array}, '0', 100);
console.log(obj); // {a: {b: [100]}}
```

```
const obj = set({}, 'a', {name: 'b', create: () => [1, 2, 3]}, '3', 200);
console.log(obj); //  {a: {b: [1, 2, 3, 200]}}
```

```
const obj = set({}, 'a', 'b', 'c', 100);
setIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c', 200);
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 100

setIfUndef(obj, 'a', {name: 'b', override: true}, 'c', 300);
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 300
```

### `assign` and `assignIfUndef`

Just like `set` and `setIfUndef`, but returns the second last hierarchy object which contains the last hierarchy property.
Cannot create root object at the same time since the whole object is not returned.

```
import { assign } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
const result = assign(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c', 100);
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 100
console.log(result); // {c: 100}
console.log(result === obj.a.b); // true
```

### `put` and `putIfUndef`

Just like `set` and `setIfUndef`, but returns the last hierarchy value.
Cannot create root object at the same time since the whole object is not returned.

```
import { putIfUndef } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
const collection = putIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', 'collection', []);
collection.push(100);

const anotherCollection = putIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', 'collection', []);
anotherCollection.push(200);
console.log(anotherCollection); // [100, 200];
console.log(collection === anotherCollection); // true
console.log(collection === obj.a.b.collection); // true
```

## Creating hierarchy properties only

All methods for creating hierarchy properties structure below have same parameters definition:

```
createHierarchyProperty(targetObject, ...hierarchyProperties);
createHierarchyProperty(targetObject, [hierarchyProperties]);
```

### `setProp`

Use primitive value as property name or property descriptor object to create hierarchy property.
Can create root object at the same time. Returns the object.

```
import { setProp } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj1 = {};
setProp(obj1, 'a', 'b', 'c');
console.log(obj1); // {a:{b:{c:{}}}}

const obj2 = setProp({}, 'a', 'b', {name:'c', type:Array});
console.log(obj2); // {a:{b:{c:[]}}}
```

### `setPropIfUndef`

Only create last hierarchy property if not exists or its value is `undefined`.

```
import { setPropIfUndef } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
setPropIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', {name:'c', value:[100]});
console.log(obj); // {a:{b:{c:[100]}}}

setPropIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', {name:'c', value:{}}); // will not override previous array
console.log(obj); // {a:{b:{c:[100]}}}
```

### `assignProp` and `assignPropIfUndef`

Just like `setProp` and `setPropIfUndef`, but returns the second last hierarchy.
Cannot create root object at the same time.

```
import { assignProp } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
const result = assignProp(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c');
console.log(obj); // {a:{b:{c:{}}}}
console.log(result); // {c:{}}
```

### `putProp` and `putPropIfUndef`

Just like `setProp` and `setPropIfUndef`, but returns the last hierarchy.
Cannot create root object at the same time.

```
import { putProp } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
const result = putProp(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c');
console.log(obj); // {a:{b:{c:{}}}}
console.log(result); // {}
console.log(result === obj.a.b.c); // true
```

## Setting value VS Creating hierarchy property

Sometimes *setting value methods* and *creating hierarchy property methods* can be replaced with each other.
The following two blocks of codes have the same effect:

```
import { set } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
set({}, 'a', 'b', 'c', []);
```

```
import { setProp } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
setProp({}, 'a', 'b', {name:'c', value:[]});
```

The first example is shorter, while the second one is useful if you want to combine property name with its value as a descriptor.

For `-IfUndef` methods, if last hierarchy property value is very expensive for creating, use creating hierarchy methods with descriptor's property `type` or `create`,
could avoid creating unnecessary values except the first time.

```
import { setIfUndef } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
setIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c', []);
setIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c', []);  // the array instance is created and then abandoned
```

```
import { setPropIfUndef } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {};
setPropIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', {name:'c', type:Array});  // the array instance is created
setPropIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', {name:'c', type:Array});  // will not create array instance
setPropIfUndef(obj, 'a', 'b', {name:'c', create: ()=>[]});  // will not create array instance
```

For setting value methods, hierarchy properties only created if not exists by default, unless `override` is specified.
Value will always be overridden unless using `-IfUndef` related methods.

For creating hierarchy property methods, non-last hierarchy properties only created if not exists by default, unless `override` is specified.
For last hierarchy property,
non `-IfUndef` methods overrides existing property and ignore `override`,
while `-IfUndef` methods will not unless `override` is `true`.

```
const obj = {};
setPropIfUndef(obj,'a','b',{name:'c', value:[]}); // obj.a.b.c === []
setPropIfUndef(obj,'a','b',{name:'c', value:{}}); // obj.a.b.c not changed
setPropIfUndef(obj,'a','b',{name:'c', value:{}, override:true}); // obj.a.b.c === {}
```

## Summary: names for assigning methods

| Returns\Category | Setting Value | Creating Hierarchy Property |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root Object | `set`, `setIfUndef` | `setProp`, `setPropIfUndef` |
| Second Last Hierarchy | `assign`, `assignIfUndef` | `assignProp`, `assignPropIfUndef` |
| Last Hierarchy | `put`, `putIfUndef` | `putProp`, `putPropIfUndef` |

# Getting

### `get`

Get value from object's hierarchy properties.

Parameter definition:

```
get(targetObject, ...hierarchyProperties);
get(targetObject, [hierarchyProperties]);
```

#### Primitive name property

Specifying properties by string, number or symbol:

```
import { get } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {a: {b: {c: 100}}};
get(obj, 'a', 'b'); // returns {c: 100}
get(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c'); // returns 100
get(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']); // returns 100
```

#### Object property

Property can be a descriptor object, which its shape is `{name|getName|getValue, got?}`.

* `name` is a primitive property name
* `getName(parent)` is a callback function to get property name
* `getValue(parent)` is a callback function to get property value directly
* `got(parent, name, current)` is a callback when value has been got from `parent`'s `name` property, `name` will be 'undefined' if value is got by `getValue`

```
import { get } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {a: {b: {c: 100}}};
get(obj,
	{
		name: 'a',
		got: (parent, name, current) => {
			/*
			parent => {a: {b: {c: 100}}};
			name => 'a';
			current => {b: {c: 100}};
			*/
		}
	},
	{
		getName: () => 'b',
		got: (parent, name, current) => {
			/*
			parent => {b: {c: 100}};
			name => 'b';
			current => {c: 100};
			*/
		}
	},
	{
		getValue: parent => parent.c,
		got: (parent, name, current) => {
			/*
			parent => {c: 100};
			name => 'undefined';
			current => 100;
			*/
		}
	}
);
```

#### Function property

Property can also be a function, it just acts as `getValue` callback in object descriptor.

```
const obj = {a: {value: 1, b1: {c: 100}, b2: {c: 200}}};
get(obj, 'a', parent => parent.value === 1 ? parent.b1 : parent.b2, 'c'); // returns 100
```

### `exist`

Check if hierarchical property name exists on target object,
not care if last hierarchy property value is `undefined` or `null`.

Parameter definition:

```
exist(target, ...propertyNames);
exist(target, [propertyNames]);
```

```
import { exist } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const obj = {a: {b: {c: 0}}};
exist(obj, 'a', 'b', 'c');  // true
exist(obj, 'a', 'b', 'd');  // false
```

### `array2map`

Turns array of object into a hash map entries.

Parameter definition:

```
array2map(sourceArray, keyHierarchyProperty|[keyHierarchyProperties], valueHierarchyProperty|[valueHierarchyProperties]);
```

"hierarchyProperty" is same as `get`'s, can be a property name, a descriptor, or a function act as `getValue`.
It is used for each item in array.

```
import { array2map } from 'object-hierarchy-access';

const products = [
	{
		productId: 'p1',
		price: 100
	},
	{
		productId: 'p2',
		price: 200
	}
];

const productPrices = array2map(products, 'productId', 'price');
/*
{
	p1: 100,
	p2: 200
}
*/
```

```
import { array2map } from 'object-hierarchy-access';

const products = [
	{
		product: {id: 'p1'},
		price: {value: 100}
	},
	{
		product: {id: 'p2'},
		price: {value: 200}
	}
];

const productPrices = array2map(products, ['product', 'id'], ['price', 'value']);
/*
{
	p1: 100,
	p2: 200
}
*/
```

### `map2array`

Turns hash map entries object into array.

Parameter definition:

```
map2array(sourceEntry, keyPropName|getKeyPropName, valuePropName|getValuePropName);
```

* `keyPropName` will becomes result item's property name to hold *key*
* `getKeyPropName(source, hashKey, hashValue)` can customize `keyName` for each entry
* `valuePropName` will becomes result item's property name to hold *value*
* `getValuePropName(source, hashKey, hashValue)` can customize `valueName` for each entry

```
import { map2array } from 'object-hierarchy-access';

const productPrices = {
	p1: 100,
	p2: 200
};

const products = map2array(productPrices, 'productId', 'price');
/*
[
	{
		productId: 'p1',
		price: 100
	},
	{
		productId: 'p2',
		price: 200
	}
]
*/
```

To customize getting value from more complex structure, consider using `pick`.

### `traverse`

Go through each hierarchy with a callback `(parent, name, current) => false?`.
Valid hierarchy property format is same as `get`.
Returns `false` in callback to terminate hierarchy iteration.

Parameter definition:

```
traverse(targetObject, ...hierarchyProperties, callback);
traverse(targetObject, [hierarchyProperties], callback);
```

```
import { traverse } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const node1 = {}, node2 = {}, node3 = {};
node1.next = node2;
node2.next = node3;
node3.next = null;
const linkedList = { next: node1 };

let nextId = 1;
traverse(linkedList, 'next', 'next', 'next', (parent, name, current) => { current.id = nextId++; });
console.log(node1.id, node2.id, node3.id); // 1, 2, 3
```

### `traverseReverse`

Just like `traverse`, but callback was invoked from last hierarchy to first hierarchy.
Returns `false` in callback to terminate hierarchy iteration.

```
import { traverseReverse } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const task = {
	done: false,
	subTasks: [
		{
			done: false,
			subTasks: [
				{done: false},  // will be done
				{done: true}
			]
		}
	]
};

task.subTasks[0].subTasks[0].done = true;
traverseReverse(task, 'subTasks', 0, 'subTasks', (parent, name, current) => {
	if (Array.isArray(current)) {
		parent.done = current.every(task => task.done);
	}
});
console.log(task.done); // true
console.log(task.subTasks[0].done); // true
```

### `select`

Choose hierarchy properties from object, and got a new object only contains chosen properties.

Parameter definition:

```
select(targetObject, ...selectedHierarchyProperties);
```

Each selected hierarchy property parameter can be an array of properties, a single primitive property,
a descriptor object `{names|getNames, got?, mapName?, mapValue?, mapped?}` or a callback function as descriptor object's `getNames`.

* `names` is an array of primitive properties, or a single primitive property
* `getNames(current)` is a callback function to get property names, should returns array of properties or a single property.
* `got(parent, name, current)` is a callback function when current hierarchy property value is got.
* `mapName(parent, name, current)` is a callback function if you want to rename hierarchy property, make sure mapped names are not conflict under same hierarchy.
* `mapValue(parent, name, current)` is a callback function if you want to transform property value into another shape. Deeper hierarchy selection will based on mapped value.
* `mapped(parent, mappedName, mappedCurrent)` is a callback function when mapping is done.

To select all properties of an object, specify `undefined` as names, no matter this object is an array or regular object.

```
import { select } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const rooms = {
	building1: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '1-101'}, {roomNo: '1-102'}, {roomNo: '1-103'}],
		floor2: [{roomNo: '1-201'}, {roomNo: '1-202'}, {roomNo: '1-203'}],
		floor3: [{roomNo: '1-301'}, {roomNo: '1-302'}, {roomNo: '1-303'}]
	},
	building2: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '2-101'}, {roomNo: '2-102'}, {roomNo: '2-103'}],
		floor2: [{roomNo: '2-201'}, {roomNo: '2-202'}, {roomNo: '2-203'}],
		floor3: [{roomNo: '2-301'}, {roomNo: '2-302'}, {roomNo: '2-303'}]
	},
	building3: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '3-101'}, {roomNo: '3-102'}, {roomNo: '3-103'}],
		floor2: [{roomNo: '3-201'}, {roomNo: '3-202'}, {roomNo: '3-203'}],
		floor3: [{roomNo: '3-301'}, {roomNo: '3-302'}, {roomNo: '3-303'}]
	},
	building4: {}
};

const allFloor1Rooms = select(rooms, ['building1', 'building2', 'building3', 'building4'], 'floor1');
/*
{
	building1: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '1-101'}, {roomNo: '1-102'}, {roomNo: '1-103'}]
	},
	building2: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '2-101'}, {roomNo: '2-102'}, {roomNo: '2-103'}]
	},
	building3: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '3-101'}, {roomNo: '3-102'}, {roomNo: '3-103'}]
	},
	building4: {}
}
*/
```

### `pick`

Similar to `select`, but only picks last hierarchy values into the same array and return.
Hierarchy selection option `mapName` is useless in this case.

```
import { pick } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const rooms = {
	building1: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '1-101'}, {roomNo: '1-102'}, {roomNo: '1-103'}],
		floor2: [{roomNo: '1-201'}, {roomNo: '1-202'}, {roomNo: '1-203'}],
		floor3: [{roomNo: '1-301'}, {roomNo: '1-302'}, {roomNo: '1-303'}]
	},
	building2: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '2-101'}, {roomNo: '2-102'}, {roomNo: '2-103'}],
		floor2: [{roomNo: '2-201'}, {roomNo: '2-202'}, {roomNo: '2-203'}],
		floor3: [{roomNo: '2-301'}, {roomNo: '2-302'}, {roomNo: '2-303'}]
	},
	building3: {
		floor1: [{roomNo: '3-101'}, {roomNo: '3-102'}, {roomNo: '3-103'}],
		floor2: [{roomNo: '3-201'}, {roomNo: '3-202'}, {roomNo: '3-203'}],
		floor3: [{roomNo: '3-301'}, {roomNo: '3-302'}, {roomNo: '3-303'}]
	},
	building4: {}
};
const allFloor1Rooms = pick(rooms, ['building1', 'building2', 'building3', 'building4'], 'floor1', undefined);
/*
[
	{roomNo: '1-101'}, {roomNo: '1-102'}, {roomNo: '1-103'},
	{roomNo: '2-101'}, {roomNo: '2-102'}, {roomNo: '2-103'},
	{roomNo: '3-101'}, {roomNo: '3-102'}, {roomNo: '3-103'},
	{roomNo: 'x-101'}, {roomNo: 'x-102'}, {roomNo: 'x-103'}
]
*/
```

```
import { pick } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const productPrices = {
	p1: {price: 100},
	p2: {price: 200}
};
const products = pick(productPrices, {
	names: undefined,
	mapValue: (parent, name, current) => ({
		productId: name,
		price: current.price
	})
});
/*
[
	{
		productId: 'p1',
		price: 100
	},
	{
		productId: 'p2',
		price: 200
	}
]
*/
```

### `group`

Divide first hierarchy properties into different hierarchical groups.

If original object is an Array, the grouped data are also arrays.

Parameter definition:

```
group(targetObject, ...groupParams);
group(targetObject, [groupParams]);
```

`groupParam` can be an descriptor object which its shape is `{type?|create?, by}`, or a callback function as descriptor object's `by`.

* `type` is the group container object type, defaults to `Object`
* `create(parent)` is a callback function to create group container object
* `by(parent, name, current)` is a callback for iterating each property on first hierarchy, should returns a group name

`parent` is `targetObject`. `name` is a property name of first hierarchy. `current` is `parent[name]`.

Specify multiple `groupParams` will create multiple group hierarchies.

```
import { group } from 'object-hierarchy-access';
const rooms = {
	building1: {
		floor0: [{roomNo: '1-001'}, {roomNo: '1-002'}, {roomNo: '1-003'}],

### `redim`

Change hierarchy dimension of an object.

Parameter definition:

```
redim(targetObject, ...hierarchyIndexes);
redim(targetObject, [hierarchyIndexes]);
```

The `hierarchyIndex` is the original depth of `targetObject`, starting from `0`.

```
import { redim } from 'object-hierarchy-access';

const obj1 = {
	red: {
		wooden: {house: 'red wooden house', ship: 'red wooden ship'},
		iron: {house: 'red iron house', ship: 'red iron ship'},
		stone: {house: 'red stone house', ship: 'red stone ship'}
	},
	green: {
		wooden: {house: 'green wooden house', ship: 'green wooden ship'},
		iron: {house: 'green iron house', ship: 'green iron ship'},
		stone: {house: 'green stone house', ship: 'green stone ship'}
	},
	blue: {
		wooden: {house: 'blue wooden house', ship: 'blue wooden ship'},
		iron: {house: 'blue iron house', ship: 'blue iron ship'},
		stone: {house: 'blue stone house', ship: 'blue stone ship'}
	}
};
const result1 = redim(obj1, 1, 2, 0);
/*
{
	wooden: {
		house: {red: "red wooden house", green: "green wooden house", blue: "blue wooden house"},
		ship: {red: "red wooden ship", green: "green wooden ship", blue: "blue wooden ship"}
	},
	iron: {
		house: {red: "red iron house", green: "green iron house", blue: "blue iron house"},
		ship: {red: "red iron ship", green: "green iron ship", blue: "blue iron ship"}
	},
	stone: {
		house: {red: "red stone house", green: "green stone house", blue: "blue stone house"},
		ship: {red: "red stone ship", green: "green stone ship", blue: "blue stone ship"}
	}
}
*/

const obj2 = [
	{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3},
	{a: 10, b: 20, c: 30},
	{a: 100, b: 200, c:300},
];
const result2 = redim(obj2, 1, 0);
/*
{
	a: [1, 10, 100],
	b: [2, 20, 200],
	c: [3, 30, 300]
}
*/
```

Notice: The returned object's depth from `0` to `Max(hierarchyIndexes)` will be created as new objects.
Thus values that reference to these hierarchies point to original hierarchies.

```
Assigning value to `__proto__` polutes `Object.prototype`.

# CVE-2020-28270

#### Date: November 12, 2020

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘object-hierarchy-access’ versions 0.2.0 through 0.32.0 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module 'object-hiearchy-access' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'set()' did not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.

#### PoC Details

The `set()` accepts arguments `optionalTarget`. Due to the absence of validation, at values passed into `optionalTarget` arguments, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the `optionalTarget`` value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning property to check whether the assigned `optionalTarget` is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as "true" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
const { set } = require('object-hierarchy-access')
var obj ={}
console.log("Before : " + obj.isAdmin);
set({}, ['__proto__', 'isAdmin'], true);
console.log("After : " + obj.isAdmin);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.2.0-0.32.0
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version 0.33.0

#### Language: JS

## An approach to AppSec that helps developer **AND** security teams

Developer and security teams have the same AppSec destination—but they use different routes to get there. And when each team has fundamentally different needs, one tool will not fit all. That’s why we offer different—but complementary—solutions for each team.

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WTW-Slider-Logo2-1-1.png)

Andrei Ungureanu,
Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/wtw-uses-mend-to-reduce-mttr/)

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Frame-1707480008.png)

Chris Wallace,
Senior Security Architect

[Read case study](https://www.mend.io/customer-success-stories/vonage/)

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

# CVE-2020-28270

#### Date: November 12, 2020

#### Overview

Prototype pollution vulnerability in ‘object-hierarchy-access’ versions 0.2.0 through 0.32.0 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.
#### Details

The NPM module 'object-hiearchy-access' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'set()' did not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.

#### PoC Details

The `set()` accepts arguments `optionalTarget`. Due to the absence of validation, at values passed into `optionalTarget` arguments, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the `optionalTarget`` value to include the `\_\_proto\_\_` property. Since there is no validation before assigning property to check whether the assigned `optionalTarget` is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as "true" as it had been polluted.
#### PoC Code

```
const { set } = require('object-hierarchy-access')
var obj ={}
console.log("Before : " + obj.isAdmin);
set({}, ['__proto__', 'isAdmin'], true);
console.log("After : " + obj.isAdmin);
```

#### Affected Environments

0.2.0-0.32.0
#### Prevention

Upgrade to version 0.33.0

#### Language: JS

## Transform your program with proactive **application security**

### Automated dependency updates

Open source code has nearly always been updated by the time a vulnerability has been published, so automated dependency updates are one of the most effective methods available for eradicating vulnerabilities.

**83%**

Vulnerability reduction for teams that consistently update new versions within 48 hours of publication.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/platform-dependency-updates-1.svg)

### Complete visibility and control

A unified view that prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities and gives teams crucial information, control, and oversight to make smart decisions and deploy security policies at scale.

**85%**

Increase in real-time application visibility

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Complete-visibility-and-control.svg)

### Spotlight experience

To rapidly identify and mitigate high-risk vulnerabilities, developers must quickly narrow down what matters most—which means developers need an embedded experience that highlights what’s critical.

**3X**

Risk reduction; time to remediation is cut by 75 percent.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Spotlight-experience-platform-img.svg)

### Incredible scalability

Cutting through the complex sprawl of existing tools to centralize and scale deployment is crucial for consistent developer adoption and policy implementation.

MTTR
Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”

Rapid results

“The biggest value we get out of Mend is the fast feedback loop, which enables our developers to respond rapidly to any vulnerability or license issues. When a vulnerability or a license is disregarded or blocked, and there is a policy violation, they get the feedback directly.”

## Cut security risks up to 70% with full-scale automated dependency updates

### Automated dependency updates

Streamline the process of keeping your software projects up-to-date and improve development efficiency.

Mend Renovate Enterprise automatically identifies outdated dependencies and creates pull requests (PRs) that suggest updates for both open source and private packages, ensuring your dependencies are always current.

![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Automated-dependency-updates.svg)

### Full-scale automation & support

Mend Renovate Enterprise scales to scan all of your repositories without slowing down, no matter how large your organization or applications become.

Plus, dedicated support from our team of experts ensures you get the most out of Mend Renovate Enterprise.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Full-scale-automation-support-1.svg)

### Technical debt reduction

Avoid development roadblocks caused by an accumulation of technical debt from outdated dependencies.

Mend Renovate Enterprise’s scalable automation for dependency updates minimizes technical debt by ensuring dependencies are current across all repositories.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Technical-debt-reduction-5.svg)

### Merge Confidence ratings & workflows

Mend Renovate Enterprise lets you know the impact each dependency update will have on your application.

Merge Confidence ratings and workflows prevent updates from creating extra work, by providing the likelihood an update will pass without breaking your application and grouping these updates together.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://www.mend.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Merge-Confidence-ratings-workflows-1.svg)

### Integrates with your repos

Mend Renovate Enterprise integrates directly into your repositories to support – not overwhelm – your devs as they work on dependency updates.

[See integrations](/integrations/)

Fast, secure, compliant
Rapid results

MTTR

“One of our most indicative KPIs is the amount of time for us to remediate vulnerabilities and also the amount of time developers spend fixing vulnerabilities in our code base, which has reduced significantly. We’re talking about at least 80% reduction in time.”

Fast, secure, compliant

“When the product you sell is an application you develop, your teams need to be fast, secure and compliant. These three factors often work in opposite directions. Mend provides the opportunity to align these often competing factors, providing Vonage with an advantage in a very competitive marketplace.”
