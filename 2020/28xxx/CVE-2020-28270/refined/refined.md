{
  "CVE-2020-28270": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `set()` function in the `object-hierarchy-access` npm module did not validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property, allowing for prototype pollution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')",
        "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE) by manipulating object properties.",
      "attack_vectors": "By providing a malicious value to the `optionalTarget` argument of the `set()` function that includes the `__proto__` property.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control the `optionalTarget` argument of the `set()` function.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists in versions 0.2.0 through 0.32.0 of the `object-hierarchy-access` npm module. The fix was implemented by preventing assignment to the `__proto__` property. The proof-of-concept code shows how setting a value on `__proto__` can pollute the prototype with the isAdmin property. This makes it so that all subsequently created objects will inherit the polluted property and value. The vulnerability is exploitable over the network with low attack complexity and does not require any privileges or user interaction."
