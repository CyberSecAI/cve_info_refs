{
  "CVE-2020-28021": {
    "Root cause": "The authenticated sender is written to the spool header file without encoding or escaping, allowing for newline injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in output",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated remote attacker can inject newlines into the spool header file and execute arbitrary commands as root.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends an SMTP MAIL FROM command with a crafted AUTH parameter containing newline characters.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the vulnerable Exim server."
