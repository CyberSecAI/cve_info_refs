Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection flaw in the admin login functionality, specifically in the `admin/ajax.php?action=login` endpoint. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows file uploads without proper validation in the `alumni/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` endpoint, where it's possible to upload a PHP file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass):** The `username` parameter in the login form is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to log in as an admin without knowing the correct credentials. The provided exploit uses `admin' or 1=1#` to bypass authentication.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload (Remote Code Execution):** The application allows the upload of files, and it appears to save the files under `/alumni/admin/assets/uploads/` directory. By uploading a PHP file (a reverse shell in this case), an attacker can achieve remote code execution. The filename is constructed using a timestamp.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection for Admin Login:**
    *   The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/college_website/admin/ajax.php?action=login` with a malicious `username` parameter (e.g., `admin' or 1=1#`).
    *   This bypasses the login, granting admin access.
2.  **File Upload for RCE:**
    *   After gaining admin access (via SQLi), the attacker sends a POST request to `/alumni/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` with a multipart form data containing a PHP reverse shell.
    *   The file is saved to the server.
3.  **Triggering the RCE:**
    *   The attacker iterates through a timeframe, attempting to access the uploaded PHP file through a GET request to `http://[TARGET URL]/alumni/admin/assets/uploads/<timestamp>_revshell.php` to execute the reverse shell.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web application.
*   The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication, as the SQLi allows bypassing the login.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints and parameter names.
*   The attacker must be able to create a malicious PHP file (reverse shell) to upload and execute.

**Summary of Exploit:**

The exploit leverages two vulnerabilities: SQL injection for admin login and unrestricted file upload for remote code execution. The Python script automates the process: it first bypasses the admin login using SQL injection, then uploads a PHP reverse shell to the server, and finally attempts to execute it by sending HTTP GET requests.

**Additional Notes**
The provided source code for the "Simple College Website" is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Arbitrary File Upload, leading to RCE.  This was exploited with a python script.  The timestamps of uploaded files can be determined by the time the exploit was run.
