  "CVE-2020-28349": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Chirpstack Network Server related to uplink message de-duplication, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is present due to insufficient message de-duplication based on frequency, leading to incorrect MIC calculation when a malicious gateway injects messages with an invalid frequency.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is insufficient de-duplication of uplink messages based solely on the physical payload (phyPayload). The de-duplication logic did not consider the transmission frequency (txCh). This allowed an attacker to manipulate the 'frequency' field of a message and cause the Network Server to calculate an invalid Message Integrity Code (MIC), leading to the message being dropped.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient de-duplication logic in the Chirpstack Network Server.",
        "Lack of validation of the frequency field leading to incorrect MIC calculation"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation results in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Legitimate uplink messages from devices are dropped, preventing them from reaching the application server. This impacts functionality, especially for critical devices like fire alarms or intrusion detectors, as they become unable to send alerts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "A compromised or malicious gateway in the network.",
          "Manipulation of the 'frequency' field in the MQTT message."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a compromised or malicious gateway within the network. The malicious gateway either needs to have read access to uplink topics on the MQTT broker to replay messages with modified frequency, or if it does not have read access, it needs to be within the radio range of the devices to capture and modify uplink messages. The attacker also needs the ability to send messages to the MQTT broker with an invalid frequency value, which leads to MIC failures."
