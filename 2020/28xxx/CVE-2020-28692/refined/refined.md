The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28692.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to a combination of insecure file management and a lack of input sanitization when handling URLs, particularly in the `lzld/thumb` endpoint which allows for downloading arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Insecure File Upload/Creation:**  The `/admin/fm` interface allows logged-in users with file management permissions to create arbitrary files within the `tmp/` directory, including `.htaccess`.
2.  **Unrestricted File Download through `lzld/thumb`:** The `lzld/thumb` endpoint takes a `src` parameter, which is intended to be a URL for an image. However, it does not properly validate this URL and allows for fetching of arbitrary files from external locations.
3.  **Lack of Sanitization:** The provided `src` parameter in the `lzld/thumb` endpoint lacks proper sanitization, allowing to fetch external URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker can upload a malicious PHP shell to the `tmp` directory of the Gila CMS installation. This shell can then be accessed to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Web-based attack:** The attack is performed through HTTP requests to the vulnerable Gila CMS instance via the web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials (as admin or any user with file management rights).
*  **Network access:** Attacker requires network access to reach the vulnerable Gila CMS server.
* **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints:** Attacker needs to know the `admin/fm` and `lzld/thumb` endpoints in order to exploit the vulnerability.
