  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of array indices when parsing files containing Nef polygon data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Type confusion"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution",
  "Attack vectors": "Providing a specially crafted malformed file as input to the CGAL library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious input file to be parsed by the vulnerable CGAL code. No specific privileges are needed."
