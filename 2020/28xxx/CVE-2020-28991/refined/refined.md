Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of URL-encoded newlines in Git protocol paths when a port is specified. This allows an attacker to inject newline characters into the path, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input, specifically URL-encoded newline characters in git protocol paths.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** As mentioned in the comments, the vulnerability can lead to partial SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Partial SSRF:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform partial SSRF attacks. This means the attacker might be able to make the server initiate requests to other internal or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions. The specific impact will depend on the context of where this path is used.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through manipulating the git protocol paths by including URL-encoded newlines when a port is specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to be able to influence or control the git protocol paths.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involves disallowing URL-encoded newlines in git protocol paths when there is a port.
- The vulnerability was reported and fixed in Gitea version 1.12.6.
- This vulnerability was also present in Gogs.
- The assigned CVE ID is CVE-2020-28991.
- The specific impact of SSRF was not included in the CVE's summary.
