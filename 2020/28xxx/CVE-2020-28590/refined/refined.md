The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28590.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation when processing `.obj` files within the `TriangleMesh::TriangleMesh()` constructor in `libslic3r`. Specifically, the code reads vertex indices from the input file without proper bounds checking, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability allows reading memory locations outside of the allocated buffer for vertex coordinates (`points`).
- **Improper input validation:** The application does not validate vertex indices from the input file, allowing the use of arbitrary, potentially large, indices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary memory locations, leading to information disclosure. This is possible because the vulnerable code reads data from memory based on the supplied vertex indices, which are not validated against the bounds of the `points` vector.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious OBJ file:** An attacker can create a specially crafted `.obj` file containing large, out-of-bounds vertex indices.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable application attempts to load and process the malicious `.obj` file using `libslic3r`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious `.obj` file to the application which uses the `libslic3r` library.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
