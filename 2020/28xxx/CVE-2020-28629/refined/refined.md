{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when reading indices from a file and using them to access vectors of various object types. This allows for out-of-bounds reads and type confusion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129)",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted, malformed file to be parsed by the vulnerable CGAL library.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious input file to the software using the vulnerable CGAL library, typically by having the software process a file provided by the attacker. No other special privileges or capabilities are mentioned."
