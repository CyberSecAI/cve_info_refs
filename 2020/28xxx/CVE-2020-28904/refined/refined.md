    "is_related": true,
    "summary": "This CVE ID refers to a privilege escalation vulnerability in Nagios Fusion, where a malicious component can be installed via the UI that allows an attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands as the 'nagios' user.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of sanitization in the component installation process, allowing an attacker with admin privileges to upload and install a malicious component. The component installation process involves a call to 'cmdsubsys.php' using a POST request to install the uploaded component. Within that script the command line for running the installation is not sanitized which will lead to command injection.",

        "Command Injection",
        "Privilege Escalation"
     ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands as the 'nagios' user by uploading and installing a malicious component.",
