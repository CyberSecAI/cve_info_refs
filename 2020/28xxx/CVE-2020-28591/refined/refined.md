Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `AMFParserContext::endElement()` function within the `libslic3r` library when parsing AMF (Additive Manufacturing File) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The `m_volume_facets` vector, which stores vertex indices read from the AMF file, is used to access `m_object_vertices`. The code does not validate the indices within `m_volume_facets` against the size of `m_object_vertices` before using them in `memcpy`. This allows an attacker to control the read address.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** Specifically, the `memcpy` operation at `libslic3r/IO/AMF.cpp:367` attempts to copy data from `m_object_vertices` using the potentially attacker-controlled index, `m_volume_facets[i++]`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By providing a specially crafted AMF file with out-of-range indices in the `<triangle>` tags, an attacker can cause the `memcpy` operation to read memory outside the bounds of the `m_object_vertices` vector. This can lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive data from the process's memory space.
- **Potential denial-of-service**: The crash information shows an AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow error, indicating the program could crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious AMF file provided by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious AMF file to the Slic3r application. No specific user privileges or network access is needed. The user must open the malicious file using slic3r.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `AMFParserContext::endElement()` function, which is a callback function used by the XML parser for end-of-element processing.
- The `m_volume_facets` vector stores vertex indices extracted from the `<triangle>` tags.
- When processing a `<volume>` node, the `memcpy` operation at `libslic3r/IO/AMF.cpp:367` uses the values in `m_volume_facets` as indices into the `m_object_vertices` vector.
- An attacker can place arbitrary values in the `<triangle>` tags, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- The vulnerable code snippet:
```c++
   for (size_t i = 0; i < m_volume_facets.size();) {
        stl_facet &facet = stl.facet_start[i/3];
        for (unsigned int v = 0; v < 3; ++ v)
            memcpy(&facet.vertex[v].x, &m_object_vertices[m_volume_facets[i ++] * 3], 3 * sizeof(float));
    }
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `Slic3r libslic3r 1.3.0` and `Master Commit 92abbc42`.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in Fedora updates for Fedora 32, 33, and 34.
