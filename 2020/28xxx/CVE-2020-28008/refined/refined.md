Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-28008:

**CVE-2020-28008: Assorted attacks in Exim's spool directory**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   Exim operates as root within its spool directory, which is owned by the "exim" user. This allows an attacker who has gained "exim" user privileges to perform various file system manipulations leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Direct Write to Spool Header Files:** An attacker can directly write to spool header files within the "input" subdirectory. This can be used to leverage vulnerabilities similar to CVE-2020-28015 which allows for new line injection into spool header files.
    *   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:**  Creating a long-named file in the "db" subdirectory can overflow a stack-based buffer in the `dbfn_open()` function, specifically within the `filename` buffer.
    *   **Arbitrary File Ownership Change via Symlink:** By creating a symlink or hardlink in the "db" subdirectory, an attacker can cause Exim to change the ownership of an arbitrary file to the "exim" user and group.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with "exim" user privileges can escalate to root privileges through multiple attack vectors.
    *   The stack-based buffer overflow can lead to a crash (stack smashing detected).
    *   The file ownership change can allow for arbitrary file modification by the "exim" user, which can be leveraged to gain root.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to gain the privileges of the "exim" user. This could be accomplished by exploiting other vulnerabilities, like the ones detailed in the advisory.
    *   Once the "exim" user is compromised, the attacker can then:
        *   Write directly to spool header files.
        *   Create long-named files in the `db` subdirectory.
        *   Create symlinks or hardlinks in the `db` subdirectory.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
    *   The attacker must first gain the privileges of the "exim" user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the vulnerabilities within CVE-2020-28008 are similar to those in a prior vulnerability described at [https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2016/DebianEximSpoolLocalRoot/](https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2016/DebianEximSpoolLocalRoot/). This provides further context and external reference.
* The content provides proof-of-concept examples for the stack buffer overflow and the arbitrary file ownership change using symlinks, and steps to achieve root access, highlighting the severity of this vulnerability
