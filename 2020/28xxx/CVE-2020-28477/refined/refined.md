Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to Prototype Pollution in the `immer` JavaScript library. This occurs because the library uses a mechanism that allows attackers to inject properties into the prototypes of JavaScript objects. Specifically, the `applyPatches` function, when used with a crafted patch containing a path that includes `__proto__`, allows modification of the base `Object` prototype. This can be achieved through property definition by path or unsafe recursive merge.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects. This is achieved by manipulating the `__proto__` property, allowing an attacker to inject or overwrite properties on the `Object.prototype`.
*   **Unsafe Property Definition:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a path-based property definition that doesn't sanitize or validate the provided path, enabling the injection of `__proto__` properties.
*  **Unsafe Recursive merge:** The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function allows modification of the prototype by using the `__proto__` property.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, the application might crash or become unstable, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain scenarios, if the application evaluates an object property controlled by the attacker (e.g. via `eval()`), it can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify properties on object prototypes that the application relies on, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data tampering, or other malicious behavior. For example injecting an `isAdmin` property.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves injecting a crafted patch using the `applyPatches` function of the `immer` library. This patch contains an operation such as `add` or `replace`, with a path targeting the `__proto__` property of an object.
*   An attacker needs to control the input to the `applyPatches` function to inject a malicious patch.
*  An attacker can also use recursive merge to pollute the prototype by using a property named `__proto__`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the `applyPatches` function with a maliciously crafted patch.
*   The attacker must have a position to supply input to a vulnerable application that utilizes `immer` library with the vulnerable versions.
*  For unsafe recursive merge, the attacker must have control over the source object passed to a merge function.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects `immer` versions `>=7.0.0 <8.0.1`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to use `applyPatches` to pollute the prototype.
*   The advisory was initially flagged as a vulnerability but later amended to indicate that it doesn't affect any version of `org.webjars.npm:immer`. However, it *does* affect versions of the npm package `immer`.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes).
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High).
*   The Snyk Security Team has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.
