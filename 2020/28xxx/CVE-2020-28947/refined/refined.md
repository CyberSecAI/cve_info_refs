The provided content is related to CVE-2020-28947.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `$id` variable when used in the `ajaxIndex.ctp` template. The `$id` variable was being directly outputted within the `onClick` attribute of an HTML element without escaping, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to XSS because user-controlled data (`$id`) is used in a way that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page, where the rendered HTML is displayed in the context of a users' session.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `onClick` attribute of an HTML element. When a user interacts with this element, the injected script would be executed in the user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing of user credentials.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- The attacker could potentially gain access to the application or the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the `$id` parameter of the request that leads to the vulnerable `ajaxIndex.ctp` view. When this view is rendered, the JavaScript is output into the `onClick` attribute without proper escaping.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the `$id` parameter that is passed to the vulnerable view. The attacker must also have access to the functionality that renders this specific view in order to inject the malicious code.
