Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2020-28025:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `pdkim_finish_bodyhash()` function within the Exim mail server. Specifically, it's triggered when verifying DKIM signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core issue is that `memcmp()` is used to compare a DKIM body hash (`sig->bodyhash.data`) with a calculated hash (`b->bh.data`). However, the code doesn't ensure that the lengths of these two data buffers (`sig->bodyhash.len` and `b->bh.len`) are equal before performing the comparison. This results in `memcmp()` potentially reading beyond the allocated memory of `sig->bodyhash.data` if `sig->bodyhash.len` is smaller than `b->bh.len`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  While the content doesn't definitively state it leads to code execution, it notes that if `acl_smtp_dkim` is set, an attacker might be able to achieve information disclosure by reading data from out of bounds memory via a crafted DKIM signature.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can inject a specially crafted "DKIM-Signature:" header into an email message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a vulnerable Exim server.
-   The attacker does not need to be authenticated by default. The requirement of `acl_smtp_dkim` to be set, which is not default, suggests this vulnerability is not easily exploitable.
