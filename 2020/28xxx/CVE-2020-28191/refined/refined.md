Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Togglz console, prior to version 2.9.4, lacked Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This allowed an attacker to potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The application did not implement proper measures to prevent CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to potentially perform state-changing requests by tricking a legitimate user into submitting them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to manipulate feature toggles in the Togglz console. This could have significant impact on the application's functionality. An attacker could, for example, disable a critical feature or enable a malicious one.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTML page or link that, when accessed by an authenticated user, would trigger requests to the Togglz console, potentially altering feature toggles.
*   **User Interaction Required:**  The user must be logged into the Togglz console and must interact with the attacker's crafted content (e.g. clicking a link or visiting a malicious page).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or send a malicious link to the victim.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication to the Togglz console; the attack relies on the victim's authenticated session.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix implemented in Togglz 2.9.4 involves introducing a CSRF token passed between the server and the client. This token is validated by the server to ensure that the request originated from the legitimate user and not an attacker.
*   The CSRF token is implemented using a cache with a timeout. If the user has an existing session, the token uses the session timeout, else it defaults to a 10 minute timeout.
*   The fix was introduced in pull request #495.

**CVSS v3.1 Metrics:**

*   **Base Score:** 8.8
*   **Attack Vector (AV):** NETWORK
