  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-28248",
    "details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `PngImg::InitStorage_` function when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate for PNG data. The multiplication of `info_.height` and `info_.rowbytes`, both 32-bit unsigned integers, can overflow, leading to a smaller-than-required memory allocation.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Integer Overflow",
          "Heap Under-allocation",
          "Heap Overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "Heap memory corruption and potential for arbitrary code execution.",
        "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious PNG file with specific `info_.height` and `info_.rowbytes` values to trigger the integer overflow and control the overflowed data with the PNG row data.",
         "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the input PNG file being processed by png-img.",
          "additional_information": "The vulnerable code allocates a buffer based on the potentially overflowed size, and later uses the non-overflowed `info_.height` in a loop which causes the writes of the row data outside of the allocated buffer's bounds."
      },
         {
        "root_cause": "The png-img package shipped with a vulnerable version of libpng (1.6.14) which contained known and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. The latest version of libpng at the time of the report was 1.6.37.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Use of vulnerable third-party library"
        ],
        "impact": "Potential exploitation of known libpng vulnerabilities, leading to arbitrary code execution or other security impacts, depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.",
        "attack_vectors": "By exploiting known vulnerabilities in libpng through the png-img package.",
         "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the input PNG file being processed by png-img, and exploit a vulnerability in the shipped libpng version.",
         "additional_information": "The report recommends updating to the latest version of libpng to mitigate the risk of these known vulnerabilities."
