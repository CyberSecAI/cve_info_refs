# GHSL-2020-142: Heap memory corruption in png-img - CVE-2020-28248

## Summary

The [png-img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/png-img) package provides NAN bindings for libpng. These bindings are vulnerable to an integer overflow which results in an underallocation of heap memory and subsequent heap memory corruption.

Additionally, the png-img package currently ships with libpng version 1.6.14 which contains several known and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. The [current public release version](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) of libpng is 1.6.37.

## Product

[png-img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/png-img)

## Tested Version

2.3.0

## Details

### Issue 1: Integer overflow resulting in heap overflow in `PngImg.cc:PngImg::InitStorage_()`

When loading a PNG image for processing by libpng the png-img bindings employ the `PngImg::InitStorage` function to allocate the initial memory required for the user supplied PNG data.

```
void PngImg::InitStorage_() {
    rowPtrs_.resize(info_.height, nullptr);
[1]
    data_ = new png_byte[info_.height * info_.rowbytes];

[2]
    for(size_t i = 0; i < info_.height; ++i) {
        rowPtrs_[i] = data_ + i * info_.rowbytes;
    }
}

```

At [1] we observe the allocation of a `png_byte` array of size `info_.height * info_.rowbytes`. Both the height and rowbytes structure members are of type `png_uint_32`, which implies the integer arithmetic expression here is explicitly an unsigned 32bit integer operation.

`info_.height` may be directly supplied from a PNG file as a 32bit integer and `info_.rowbytes` is derived from the PNG data as well.

This multiplication may trigger an integer overwrap which results in an underallocation of the `data_` memory region.

For example, if we set `info_.height` to 0x01000001 with an `info_.rowbytes` value of 0x100, the resulting expression would be (0x01000001 \* 0x100) & 0xffffffff == 0x100, and as a result `_data` would underallocated as a 0x100 sized png\_byte array.

As a consequence, at [2], the `rowPtrs_` array will be populated with row-data pointers that point outside of the bounds of the allocated memory region since the for loop conditional operates on the original `info_.height` value.

Subsequently, once the actual row data is read from the PNG file, any adjacent memory to the `data_` region may be overwritten with attacker controlled row-data up to `info_.height * info_.rowbytes` bytes, affording a great deal of process memory control to any would-be attacker.

Note that this overwrite may be halted early according to attacker wishes by simply not supplying sufficient amounts of row-data from the PNG itself, at which point libpng error routines would kick in. Any subsequent program logic handling the error paths would then operate on corrupted heap memory. This results in a highly controlled heap overflow in terms of both contents and size.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to arbitrary code execution if png-img is used to operate on untrusted PNG files.

### Issue 2: vulnerable version of libpng shipped with png-img

The png-img package currently ships with libpng version 1.6.14 which contains several known and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. The [current public release version](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) of libpng is 1.6.37.

It is recommended to update to the latest release version of libpng to prevent future abuse of known libpng vulnerabilities exposed via the png-img package.

Lite self-contained png image processing library for macOS and Linux.

## Requirements

### Linux

* Depends on [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 4.6+

### macOs

* Tested with Xcode 6.0 (but should also work with 5.0) and Xcode 11.3
* [`node-gyp` installation docs](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-macos)
* [`node-gyp` installation docs for Calalina](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/macOS_Catalina.md)

### Windows

* Tested with MSVC 2013 Express
* [`node-gyp` installation docs](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows)

## Installation

```
npm install png-img

```
## API

### new PngImg(buffer)

Create `PngImg` object from passed buffer with image.

Arguments:

* `buf` - `Buffer` with image file content.

```
const fs = require('fs');
const {PngImg} = require('png-img');

const buf = fs.readFileSync('path/to/img.png');
const img = new PngImg(buf);
```
### size()

Get image size as an object.

```
console.log(img.size());
```

for 32x32 image will print out:

```
{ width: 32, height: 32 }

```
### get(x, y)

Get pixel color and alpha.

Returns object:

* r: red channel (0 to 255)
* g: green channel (0 to 255)
* b: blue channel (0 to 255)
* a: alpha (0 to 255). 0 - transparent

```
console.log(img.get(0, 0));
```

will print pixel and color for pixel (0, 0):

```
{
  r: 100,
  g: 150,
  b: 200,
  a: 255
}
```
### fill(offsetX, offsetY, widht, height, color)

Fill region with passed color. Modifies current image.

Arguments:

* `offsetX` - horizontal offset from the left side of the image
* `offsetY` - vertical offset from the top side of the image
* `width` - region width
* `height` - region height
* `color` - color as {r,g,b,a} object or as a '#XXXXXX' string

Returns: current image object

Throws if region is not inside the current image

```
img
  .fill(0, 0, 16, 16, '#00ffFF') // fill with cyan
  .fill(16, 16, 16, 16, {r: 0, g: 255, b: 255, a: 127}); // fill with half-transparent cyan
```
### set(x, y, color)

Same as `fill(x, y, 1, 1, color)`

### crop(offsetX, offsetY, widht, height)

Crop image. Modifies current image.

Arguments:

* `offsetX` - horizontal offset from the left side of the image
* `offsetY` - vertical offset from the top side of the image
* `width` - new width
* `height` - new height

Returns: current image object

Throws if new image is not inside the current image.

```
img
    .crop(0, 0, 16, 16)
    .crop(8, 8, 8, 8);
```
### setSize(width, height)

Sets new image size. Modifies current image.

Arguments:

* `width` - new width
* `height` - new height

Returns: current image object

If new size is less or equal than current size, than `crop` will be performed.

**Note**: this method doesn't strech current image, it just sets new size. If new dimension is less than previous
than image will be cut. If new dimension is greater than previous than image will be extended with black area.

```
var size = img.size();
img
  .setSize(size.width/2, size.height*2);
```
### insert(img, offsetX, offsetY)

Inserts image into specified place.

Arguments:

* `img` - image to insert. Should be a PngImg object
* `offsetX` - horizontal offset from the left side of the image
* `offsetY` - vertical offset from the top side of the image

Join to images (pretend that they have same witdh):

```
var otherImg = new PngImg(/*...*/)
img
 .setSize(img.size().width, img.size().height + otherImg.size().height)
 .insert(otherImg, 0, img.size().height);
```
### rotateRight()

Rotates image 90 degrees clockwise

### rotateLeft()

Rotates image 90 degress counterclockwise

### save(file)

Save image to file. Asynchronous operation.

Arguments:

* `file` - path to file to save image

Overwrites existing file.

```
await img.save('path/to/file.png');
```
## Build

```
npm run build

```

This will build native node extension and place it to the `compiled` directory

[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bf1e93bb158cbe249120765987b22653533022e2321c176d20295a0d3a43ad60/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f67656d696e692d74657374696e672f706e672d696d672e737667)](https://travis-ci.org/gemini-testing/png-img)

Lite self-contained png image processing library for macOS and Linux.

## Requirements

### Linux

* Depends on [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 4.6+

### macOs

* Tested with Xcode 6.0 (but should also work with 5.0) and Xcode 11.3
* [`node-gyp` installation docs](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-macos)
* [`node-gyp` installation docs for Calalina](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/macOS_Catalina.md)

### Windows

* Tested with MSVC 2013 Express
* [`node-gyp` installation docs](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows)

## Installation

```
npm install png-img

```

## API

### new PngImg(buffer)

Create `PngImg` object from passed buffer with image.

Arguments:

* `buf` - `Buffer` with image file content.

```
const fs = require('fs');
const {PngImg} = require('png-img');

const buf = fs.readFileSync('path/to/img.png');
const img = new PngImg(buf);
```

### size()

Get image size as an object.

```
console.log(img.size());
```

for 32x32 image will print out:

```
{ width: 32, height: 32 }

```

### get(x, y)

Get pixel color and alpha.

Returns object:

* r: red channel (0 to 255)
* g: green channel (0 to 255)
* b: blue channel (0 to 255)
* a: alpha (0 to 255). 0 - transparent

```
console.log(img.get(0, 0));
```

will print pixel and color for pixel (0, 0):

```
{
  r: 100,
  g: 150,
  b: 200,
  a: 255
}
```

### fill(offsetX, offsetY, widht, height, color)

Fill region with passed color. Modifies current image.

Arguments:

* `offsetX` - horizontal offset from the left side of the image
* `offsetY` - vertical offset from the top side of the image
* `width` - region width
* `height` - region height
* `color` - color as {r,g,b,a} object or as a '#XXXXXX' string

Returns: current image object

Throws if region is not inside the current image

```
img
  .fill(0, 0, 16, 16, '#00ffFF') // fill with cyan
  .fill(16, 16, 16, 16, {r: 0, g: 255, b: 255, a: 127}); // fill with half-transparent cyan
```

### set(x, y, color)

Same as `fill(x, y, 1, 1, color)`

### crop(offsetX, offsetY, widht, height)

Crop image. Modifies current image.

Arguments:

* `offsetX` - horizontal offset from the left side of the image
* `offsetY` - vertical offset from the top side of the image
* `width` - new width
* `height` - new height

Returns: current image object

Throws if new image is not inside the current image.

```
img
    .crop(0, 0, 16, 16)
    .crop(8, 8, 8, 8);
```

### setSize(width, height)

Sets new image size. Modifies current image.

Arguments:

* `width` - new width
* `height` - new height

Returns: current image object

If new size is less or equal than current size, than `crop` will be performed.

**Note**: this method doesn't strech current image, it just sets new size. If new dimension is less than previous
than image will be cut. If new dimension is greater than previous than image will be extended with black area.

```
var size = img.size();
img
  .setSize(size.width/2, size.height*2);
```

### insert(img, offsetX, offsetY)

Inserts image into specified place.

Arguments:

* `img` - image to insert. Should be a PngImg object
* `offsetX` - horizontal offset from the left side of the image
* `offsetY` - vertical offset from the top side of the image

Join to images (pretend that they have same witdh):

```
var otherImg = new PngImg(/*...*/)
img
 .setSize(img.size().width, img.size().height + otherImg.size().height)
 .insert(otherImg, 0, img.size().height);
```

### rotateRight()

Rotates image 90 degrees clockwise

### rotateLeft()

Rotates image 90 degress counterclockwise

### save(file)

Save image to file. Asynchronous operation.

Arguments:

* `file` - path to file to save image

Overwrites existing file.

```
await img.save('path/to/file.png');
```

## Build

```
npm run build

```

This will build native node extension and place it to the `compiled` directory

## Release

1. Up version in package json, create tag, and push it to repo. **Note**: Do not publish the package.

```
$ npm version <patch|minor|major>
$ git push && git push --tags

```

2. Go to [tags page](https://github.com/gemini-testing/png-img/tags) and create release from pushed tag.
3. Wait for the release workflow to finish. See the [actions page](https://github.com/gemini-testing/png-img/actions) to find the workflow.

## Vagrant

Use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to build and test on Linux and Windows from macOS.

Tested with Vagrant 1.7 and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 4.3.

1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox.
2. Create Windows vagrant box (see [howto](/gemini-testing/png-img/blob/master/dev/vagrant-win-box.md))
3. Run `vagrant up --provider virtualbox`
4. Specify `OS` env variable to run and test on specific platform:

* `npm run build`, `npm test` - current platform
* `OS=linux npm test` - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 14.04
* `OS=linux-old npm test` - Ubuntu 12.04
* `OS=win npm test` - Windows
* `OS=all npm test` - all
