Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official SugarCRM v6.5.18 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to
compromise browser to web-application requests from the application-side.
The persistent cross site web vulnerability is located in the primary address state and alternate address state
input fields of the sales or support module open to create a contacts. Remote attackers with low privileged
sugarcrm accounts are able to inject own malicious script code as contact. Higher privileged application user
accounts will execute the script code on preview of the created contact to e.g gain moderator or administrator
rights via session hijacking, phishing or further persistent manipulative web attacks. The code does not only
execute in the same section were the contact is listed or previewed but also after save in the view log function
context. The attack can thus way be performed via create of a contact or via import of a vcf file contact.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack is limited to registered user accounts with default
contact to the contacts module.
The script code is able to bypass the basic validation process because of the primary address state and alternate
address state are exchanged in the transmit request. Normally in a regular transmit the context is parsed securely.
In the actual case an attacker injects script code in the alternate adress when changing the main adress the wrong
sanitized code occurs in the front-end.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Sales
[+] Support
Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Primary Address State
[+] Alternate Address State
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] primary address state
[+] alternate address state
Affected Module(s):
[+] Sales - Contact List
[+] Support - Contact List
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the sugarcrm application
2. Login as low privileged user account
3. Move to sales or support and click to contact, then open create a new contact
4. Inject payload in the other address and primary adress to the alternate address state and primary state input fields
5. Save the entry and a refresh occurs with the inserted contact details
Note: The script code execute immediatly after saving in the primary adress state and alternate adress state section of both modules
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched following the next steps ...
1. Restrict the input fields and disallow special chars for the main name values displayed in the list
2. Escape the input transmitted from the alternate and primary inputs
3. Parse and sanitize the ouput location to ensure its filtered securely
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent cross site web vulnerability in the sugarcrm web-application is estimated as medium.
