{
  "CVE-2020-28949": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of filenames within tar archives processed by the Archive_Tar PHP module.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
       "Object injection through Phar unserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite files on the server or achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the vulnerability via crafted tar archives containing malicious filenames.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading a crafted tar archive with manipulated filenames",
      "Phar unserialization through a crafted archive with a malicious filename",
      "Local File Overwrite using stream wrappers"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to upload a crafted tar archive to the target system or application that utilizes the vulnerable component. If the PHP process is running under a privileged user the impact is greater, with possible overwrite of critical files (e.g. /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow). The attacker also needs to have `phar.readonly` disabled in php.ini for the phar unserialization attack.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability can be bypassed with filenames such as `PHAR://malicious_file.phar` (scheme in capital letters) or `file://path/to/file/to/be/overwritten`. It also impacts the PEAR Archive_Tar package."
