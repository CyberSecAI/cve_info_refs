            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-28368 / XSA-351
                               version 3

                 Information leak via power sidechannel

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Fix some version tags.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers have demonstrated using software power/energy monitoring
interfaces to create covert channels, and infer the operations/data used
by other contexts within the system.

Access to these interfaces should be restricted to privileged software,
but it was found that Xen doesn't restrict access suitably, and the
interfaces are accessible to all guests.

For more information, see:
  <https://platypusattack.com>
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html>

IMPACT
======

An unprivileged guest administrator can sample platform power/energy
data.  This may be used to infer the operations/data used by other
contexts within the system.

The research demonstrates using this sidechannel to leak the AES keys
used elsewhere in the system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Power/energy monitoring interfaces are platform and architecture
specific.  Consult your hardware vendor to ascertain what power feedback
interfaces are available.

For ARM systems, all versions of Xen are vulnerable.  The fix restricts
access to the AMU (Activity Monitors Unit) interface, introduced in
Armv8.4.

For x86 systems, Xen 4.14 and earlier are vulnerable - master is not
vulnerable, as these issues have been addressed in a more general
fashion.

The x86 fixes restrict access to:
 * Intel RAPL interface, introduced in SandyBridge CPUs.
 * Intel platform energy interface.
 * Intel perf_ctl interface, introduced in Pentium 4 CPUs and also
   implemented by other vendors.
 * AMD RAPL interface, introduced in Ryzen/EPYC CPUs.
 * AMD compute unit energy interface, present in Fam15/16 CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 351 v2 (CVE-2020-28368) - Information leak
 via power sidechannel

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-28368 / XSA-351
                              version 2

                 Information leak via power sidechannel

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers have demonstrated using software power/energy monitoring
interfaces to create covert channels, and infer the operations/data used
by other contexts within the system.

Access to these interfaces should be restricted to privileged software,
but it was found that Xen doesn't restrict access suitably, and the
interfaces are accessible to all guests.

For more information, see:
  <https://platypusattack.com>
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html>

IMPACT
======

An unprivileged guest administrator can sample platform power/energy
data.  This may be used to infer the operations/data used by other
contexts within the system.

The research demonstrates using this sidechannel to leak the AES keys
used elsewhere in the system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Power/energy monitoring interfaces are platform and architecture
specific.  Consult your hardware vendor to ascertain what power feedback
interfaces are available.

For ARM systems, all versions of Xen are vulnerable.  The fix restricts
access to the AMU (Activity Monitors Unit) interface, introduced in
Armv8.4.

For x86 systems, Xen 4.14 and earlier are vulnerable - master is not
vulnerable, as these issues have been addressed in a more general
fashion.

The x86 fixes restrict access to:
 * Intel RAPL interface, introduced in SandyBridge CPUs.
 * Intel platform energy interface.
 * Intel perf_ctl interface, introduced in Pentium 4 CPUs and also
   implemented by other vendors.
 * AMD RAPL interface, introduced in Ryzen/EPYC CPUs.
 * AMD compute unit energy interface, present in Fam15/16 CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

# New Platypus attack can steal data from Intel CPUs

Intel has released microcode updates today to prevent attackers from abusing the Intel RAPL mechanism to steal sensitive data from its CPUs.
  ![catalin-cimpanu.jpg](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/cfe8bff3bdc8af3f2ab8d2a4252f39ca491137af/2018/08/21/a59867e9-8d75-40af-a87c-690638f8afa4/catalin-cimpanu.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&frame=1&height=192&width=192) Written by [Catalin Cimpanu, Contributor](/meet-the-team/catalin-cimpanu/)  Nov. 10, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. PT

               ![Platypus](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/02448a31a3c354317ab4fea3decd70f44ce978b3/2020/11/09/5af3e967-c305-40b8-b0d5-a676791fbc30/platypus.png?auto=webp&width=1280)

A team of academics has disclosed today a new attack method that can extract data from Intel CPUs.

NamedÂ **Platypus**, an acronym for "**P**owerÂ **L**eakageÂ **A**ttacks:Â **T**argetingÂ **Y**ourÂ **P**rotectedÂ **U**serÂ **S**ecrets," the attack targets the RAPL interface of Intel processors.

**RAPL**, which stands forÂ *Running Average Power Limit*, is a component that allows firmware or software applications to monitor power consumption in the CPU and DRAM.

RAPL, which effectively lets firmware and software apps read how much electrical power a CPU is pulling in to perform its tasks, is a system that has been used for years to track and debug application and hardware performance.

### Researcher steal encryption keys via Intel RAPL

In a research paper published today, academics from the Graz University of Technology, the University of Birmingham, and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security have revealed how a Platypus attack can be used to determine what data is being processed inside a CPU by looking at values reported via the RAPL interface.

"Using PLATYPUS, we demonstrate that we can observe variations in the power consumption to distinguish different instructions and different Hamming weights of operands and memory loads, allowing inference of loaded values," researchers said.

These "loaded values" refer to data loaded in the CPU. These can be encryption keys, passwords, sensitive documents, or any other type of information.

Accessing this kind of data is normally protected by a slew of security systems, such as kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) or hardware-isolated trusted execution environments (TEEs), like Intel SGX.

However, researchers say that Platypus allows an attacker to bypass all these security systems by looking at variations in power consumption values.

In tests, researchers said they bypassed KASLR by observing RAPL power consumption values for only 20 seconds, and then they retrieved data from the Linux kernel. In another test, they also retrieved data that was being processed inside Intel SGX secure enclaves.

A Platypus attack that retrieved RSA private keys from an SGX enclave required the attacker to monitor RAPL data for 100 minutes, while an attack that retrieved AES-NI encryption keys from an SGX enclave and from the Linux kernel memory space took 26 hours.

### Linux more vulnerable than the rest

According to the research team, Platypus attacks work on Linux systems the best. This is because the Linux kernel ships with theÂ *powercap framework*, a universal driver for interacting with RAPL interfaces and other power capping APIs, allowing easy reads of power consumption values.

Attacks on Windows and macOS are also possible, but in these cases, theÂ [Intel Power Gadget](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-power-gadget.html)Â app must be installed on the attacked devices to allow the attackers to interact with the RAPL interface.

Platypus attacks aimed at Intel SGX enclaves work regardless of the underlying OS as the attackers are going after the (separate) SGX enclave and not the underlying OS and its (separate) CPU memory.

### A first of its kind remote attack

The Platypus attack, named so after the platypus animal's ability to sense electrical current with its bill, is a first of its kind attack.

While other research teams have managed to observe CPU power read-outs by connecting oscilloscopes to a CPU, Platypus attacks can be carried out remotely.

For example, the attack's code can be packed inside malicious apps (malware) that are installed or planted on a targeted device. This allows the attack to carry out without a threat actor needing physical access to the attacked system.

Platypus also differs fromÂ [PlunderVolt](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-plundervolt-attack-impacts-intel-cpus/), another attack against the power voltage interface of Intel CPUs. However, the two attacks are different, Moritz Lipp, one of the researchers who worked on both Platypus and PlunderVolt, toldÂ *ZDNet*.

The difference is that PlunderVolt is an active attack that modifies power values, while Platypus is a passive attack that infers data just by looking at the power consumption data.

### Patches available starting today

Researchers say that Platypus works against Intel server, desktop, and laptop CPUs. Intel has also confirmed that some mobile and embedded CPUs are also impacted.

The chipmaker has released todayÂ [microcode (CPU firmware) updates](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html)Â to block Platypus attacks, which the company has made available to industry partners to include in their products' next security updates.

The Linux kernel has also shipped an update. The update restricts access to the RAPL interface only to apps with elevated privileges, making attacks harder to pull off from inside low-level apps.

Updates for the Platypus attacks will contain references for CVE-2020-8694 (Linux+Intel), CVE-2020-8695 (Intel), and CVE-2020-12912 (Linux+AMD), the three identifiers for the issues exploited during a Platypus attack.

### No need to panic

But amidst an onslaught of recentÂ [Intel CPU bugs](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/all-the-major-intel-vulnerabilities/), there is no need to panic. Intel also said that it was not aware of any attacks exploiting this bug in the wild, outside the academic research field.

Most of the CPUs affected by the Platypus attack are recent CPU models that are still supported by both Intel and device makers, which will most likely distribute Intel's microcode updates to users in future updates.

A list of affected CPUs is available in Intel's security advisoryÂ [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html).

### Other CPU makers likely impacted as well

Besides Intel, almost all other chipmakers also include a RAPL interface with their products. The research team says that these products are also likely impacted; however, they have not tested all devices available on the market today due to prohibitive research time and budget costs.

"We already ran some experiments on AMD where we observed leakage through the energy consumption as well (it's in the Appendix of the paper)," Lipp told ZDNet. For its part, AMD has also [released updates for its Linux driver](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security) as well.

"We [also] discussed ARM-based devices as well but did not had the time to thoroughly evaluate them."

Other processor vendors that shipped RAPL-like power capping systems included NVIDIA, Marvell, and Ampere.

Additional details about the Platypus attack, including a research paper [[PDF](https://platypusattack.com/platypus.pdf)], are available on aÂ [dedicated website](https://platypusattack.com).

*Update: Article updated with AMD CVE, which became public after this article's publication.*

# PLATYPUS

## With Great Power comes Great Leakage

With **PLATYPUS**, we present novel software-based **power side-channel attacks** on Intel server, desktop and laptop CPUs. We exploit the **unprivileged access** to the Intel RAPL interface exposing the processor's power consumption to **infer data** and **extract cryptographic keys**.

# PLATYPUS in Action

### The Power Meter within the CPU. Intel RAPL.

With classical power side-channel attacks, an adversary typically attaches an oscilloscope to monitor the energy consumption of a device.
Since Intel Sandy Bridge CPUs, the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface allows **monitoring** and controlling the **power consumption** of the CPU and DRAM **in software**.
Hence, the CPU basically comes with its own power meter.
With the current implementation of the Linux driver, every **unprivileged user** has access to its measurements.

Luckily, the update interval of the RAPL interface is low compared to real oscilloscopes.
The RAPL interface has a bandwidth of 20 kHz, whereas oscilloscopes are in the range of multiple GHz.
Moreover, the values are filtered using a running average, making it harder to infer secrets.

Intel RAPL integrates power meter capabilities in the CPU.

PLATYPUS can recover cryptographic keys from Intel SGX and the kernel.

### PLATYPUS. Finding Secrets in the Dark.

Platypuses are fascinating animals:
While they are mammals, they also lay eggs, and males can **detect electrical signals** with their bill.
Likewise to the Platypus that uses its ability to find food even in complete darkness, we **sense secrets** in the processor's energy measurements using Intel RAPL.

Using PLATYPUS, we demonstrate that we can observe variations in the power consumption to distinguish different instructions and different Hamming weights of operands and memory loads, allowing inference of loaded values.
PLATYPUS can further infer **intra-cacheline control flow** of applications, **break KASLR**, **leak AES-NI keys** from Intel SGX enclaves and the Linux kernel, and establish a timing-independent covert channel.

With SGX, Intel released a security feature to create isolated environments, so-called enclaves, that are secure even if the **operating system is compromised**.
In our work, we combine PLATYPUS with precise execution control of [SGX-Step](https://github.com/jovanbulck/sgx-step).
As a result, we overcome the hurdle of the limited measuring capabilities of Intel RAPL by repeatedly executing single instructions inside the SGX enclave.
Using this technique, we **recover RSA keys** processed by mbed TLS from an SGX enclave.

### Protecting against PLATYPUS. Fixing RAPL.

On Linux, the powercap framework provides unprivileged access to the Intel RAPL counters.
With a recent **security update**, this access is revoked, and an unprivileged attacker can not retrieve power measurements anymore.

However, this update does not protect against a privileged attacker, e.g., a compromised operating system targeting Intel SGX.
To mitigate attacks in this scenario, Intel released **microcode updates** to affected processors.
These updates ensure that the reported energy consumption hinders the ability to distinguish the same instructions with different data or operands if Intel SGX is enabled on the system.

Please make sure to **get the latest updates** for your operating system and BIOS.

# Questions & Answers

Am I affected by this bug?

Intel provides a list with all **affected products [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html)**.

We disclosed the problem to AMD and ARM as well. However, currently, we are not aware of any official statement regarding affected products from these vendors.

What is the impact of PLATYPUS?

With classical power side-channel attacks, an attacker typically has physical access to a victim device. Using an oscilloscope, the attacker monitors the energy consumption of the device. With interfaces like Intel RAPL, **physical access is not required** anymore as the measurements can be accessed directly from software. Previous work already showed limited information leakage caused by the Intel RAPL interface. [Mantel et al.](https://www.mais.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/WebBibPHP/papers/2018/2018-ESORICS-MantelSchickelWeberWeber-.pdf) showed that it is possible to distinguish if different cryptographic keys have been processed by the CPU. [Paiva et al.](https://www.ime.usp.br/~tpaiva/papers/Paiva2019_CovertChannelsBasedOnDRAMPower.pdf) established a covert channel by modulating the energy consumption of the DRAM.

Our research shows that the Intel RAPL interface can be exploited in way more threatening scenarios. We show that in addition to distinguishing different keys, it is possible to **reconstruct entire cryptographic keys**. We demonstrate this by **recovering AES** keys from the **side-channel resilient AES-NI** implementation, as well as RSA keys from an Intel SGX enclave. In addition, we distinguish different Hamming weights of operands or memory loads, **threatening constant-time implementations of cryptographic algorithms**.
To mitigate PLATYPUS, the unprivileged access to the energy consumption has been revoked with an update to the operating system. With Intel SGX, however, a compromised operating system is within the threat model, rendering this mitigation insufficient. Therefore, Intel released microcode updates that change the way the energy consumption is reported if Intel SGX is enabled on the system. Instead of actual energy measurements, it falls back to a model-based approach, such that same instructions with different data or operands can not be distinguished.

What about other processor vendors (ARM, AMD, etc.)?

Within our research, we focused on Intel's RAPL implementation as the threat model of Intel SGX allows a privileged attacker to achieve a more precise execution control of the victim. However, starting with the Zen microarchitecture, **AMD CPUs also provide a RAPL interface** that even allows measuring the energy consumption per individual core. With Linux kernel 5.8, this interface also grants access to unprivileged applications, however, currently limited to AMD Rome CPUs.

Furthermore, other processor vendors like **ARM** and **NVIDIA** have on-board energy meters that can be used. **Marvell** and **Ampere** also provide kernel drivers to provide unprivileged access to hardware sensors. However, as we do not or have only limited access to these devices, we were not able to conduct any experiments on these devices.

Which operating systems are affected?

On Linux, the *powercap* framework provides unprivileged access to Intel RAPL **by default**. On Windows and macOS, the [Intel Power Gadget](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-power-gadget.html) needs to be installed. Therefore, the presented attacks exploiting the unprivileged access only work on Linux.

For a privileged attacker targeting Intel SGX, the operating system used does not matter.

Why is it called PLATYPUS?

Platypuses are fascinating animals: While they are mammals, they also lay eggs. They have a bill like a duck, a tail like a beaver and a fur like an otter. Males are venomous, but more importantly, they can **detect electrical signals** with their bill. Likewise to the Platypus that uses its ability to find food even in complete darkness, we **sense secrets** in the energy measurements of the processor using Intel RAPL.

In addition, PLATYPUS is an acronym for "**P**ower **L**eakage **A**ttacks: **T**argeting **Y**our **P**rotected **U**ser **S**ecrets".

What mitigations are available for PLATYPUS?

As the Linux driver provides unrestricited access to the Intel RAPL interface, a **security update** makes this access privileged.

However, in a setting where the victim is an Intel SGX enclave, this patch does not prevent a compromised operating system from accessing the Intel RAPL counters directly. Therefore, Intel **released microcode updates** that change the way the energy consumption is reported if Intel SGX is enabled on the system. Instead of actual energy measurements, it falls back to a model-based approach, such that same instructions with different data or operands can not be distinguished. Thus, if the enclave follows the Intel guide lines and uses constant-time cryptographic implementations, an adversary should not be able to recover any secrets of the enclave.

Is there more technical information about PLATYPUS?

Yes, there is an **academic research paper** that can be downloaded [here](platypus.pdf).

Additionally, **Intel** released a Security Advisory that can be accessed [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html). **XEN**'s security advisory can be accssed [here](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-351.html).

What is Intel SGX?

[Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions) is an innovative processor technology released in 2015 to create isolated environments in the computer's memory, so-called enclaves. SGX acts like a **secure vault in the processor** itself, combining strong encryption and hardware-level isolation to safeguard enclave programs, and the data they operate on, even against very advanced types of malware that compromise the operating system, hypervisor, or firmware (BIOS).

What is CVE-2020-8694 and CVE-2020-8695?

CVE-2020-8694 and CVE-2020-8695 are the **official references** to PLATYPUS. CVE is the Standard for Information Security Vulnerability Names maintained by MITRE.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-28368 / XSA-351
                               version 3

                 Information leak via power sidechannel

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Fix some version tags.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers have demonstrated using software power/energy monitoring
interfaces to create covert channels, and infer the operations/data used
by other contexts within the system.

Access to these interfaces should be restricted to privileged software,
but it was found that Xen doesn't restrict access suitably, and the
interfaces are accessible to all guests.

For more information, see:
  <https://platypusattack.com>
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00389.html>

IMPACT
======

An unprivileged guest administrator can sample platform power/energy
data.  This may be used to infer the operations/data used by other
contexts within the system.

The research demonstrates using this sidechannel to leak the AES keys
used elsewhere in the system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Power/energy monitoring interfaces are platform and architecture
specific.  Consult your hardware vendor to ascertain what power feedback
interfaces are available.

For ARM systems, all versions of Xen are vulnerable.  The fix restricts
access to the AMU (Activity Monitors Unit) interface, introduced in
Armv8.4.

For x86 systems, Xen 4.14 and earlier are vulnerable - master is not
vulnerable, as these issues have been addressed in a more general
fashion.

The x86 fixes restrict access to:
 * Intel RAPL interface, introduced in SandyBridge CPUs.
 * Intel platform energy interface.
 * Intel perf_ctl interface, introduced in Pentium 4 CPUs and also
   implemented by other vendors.
 * AMD RAPL interface, introduced in Ryzen/EPYC CPUs.
 * AMD compute unit energy interface, present in Fam15/16 CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.
