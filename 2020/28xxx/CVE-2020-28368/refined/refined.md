Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control to power/energy monitoring interfaces in the Xen hypervisor. These interfaces, designed to monitor CPU power consumption, were not restricted to privileged software, making them accessible to unprivileged guest administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Information Leakage:** Unrestricted access to power/energy monitoring interfaces allows an attacker to observe variations in power consumption, enabling them to infer the operations and data being processed by the CPU. This constitutes a side-channel attack.
* **Lack of Access Control:** The primary weakness lies in the hypervisor's failure to restrict access to the power/energy monitoring interfaces to only privileged software components.
* **Covert Channels:** The ability to sample power/energy data enables the creation of covert channels, allowing unauthorized information transfer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Confidentiality Breach:** Exploitation leads to the leakage of sensitive information, including cryptographic keys (e.g., AES keys, RSA private keys), passwords, and other data processed by the CPU.
* **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:** The attack can circumvent security mechanisms like Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) and hardware-isolated trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX.
* **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** Although not a direct privilege escalation, the ability to access data from different contexts, like the kernel or other guests, can be used to aid in further privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Software-Based:** The attack is purely software-based and does not require physical access to the target system.
* **Remote Execution:** The attack can be executed remotely, as malicious code can be deployed within a guest VM, and the attacker can remotely access power consumption data.
* **Malicious Applications:** The attack can be implemented via malicious apps that are installed on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Guest Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within a guest virtual machine running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
* **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute code within the guest VM to access the power/energy monitoring interfaces.
* **Knowledge of Power Analysis Techniques:** Although the power data is directly available through the RAPL interface, some level of understanding is needed to interpret the data for information leakage.

**Specific Details:**
*   The vulnerability is referred to as "Platypus" attack.
*   The vulnerability impacts various power/energy monitoring interfaces, including Intel RAPL, Intel platform energy interface, Intel perf_ctl interface, AMD RAPL interface, and AMD compute unit energy interface.
*   For ARM systems, the fix restricts access to the AMU (Activity Monitors Unit) interface, introduced in Armv8.4.
*   For x86 systems, Xen versions 4.14 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability affects various OSes, with Linux being more easily exploitable due to the powercap framework. Windows and macOS are also potentially vulnerable but require the Intel Power Gadget app to interface with RAPL.
*   The issue affects Intel server, desktop, and laptop CPUs, and some mobile and embedded CPUs.
*   Patches were released to restrict access to RAPL interface to privileged applications and microcode updates are provided by Intel.

This vulnerability represents a significant threat because it allows an attacker to steal data from other contexts of a virtualized environment, bypassing traditional security boundaries. The ability to perform this remotely through software, without physical access, amplifies the severity of the issue.
