 Hi All, I was able to identify CVS injection vulnerability in Avaya Call Management System (CMS). Avaya Call Management System (CMS) is an integrated analysis and reporting solution that keeps you in touch with virtually everything that’s going on in your contact center from evaluating the performance of a single agent or group of agents to managing a contact center with multiple locations worldwide. During the security assessment of CMS Supervisor Web application, i noted that whole section of "Administration" has a feature to download the content in CSV format. Any malicious user can inject malicious CSV payload, which will be executed if the admin downloads the csv report and opens it. The Excel will ask the admin to enable the content, since the report is downloaded from trusted source he will click on enable which will execute the content. Vulnerability and Fixed: Vulnerability Name : CMS is vulnerable to CSV Injection Assigned CVE:  CVE-2023-3527 ASA Num...

 Dear reader, While testing different features of TEAMS, I find out a CSV injection vulnerability in TEAMS Webinar feature, where any external user, or attacker can register himself for attending public webinar and in webinar registration page he can inject a malicious payload which will executed once the admin download the attendees list. As per Microsoft they are not accepting it as high/medium security bug (which I totally Disagree) and not eligible for bounty or hall of fame, also they provided the permission to disclose this publicly.  As per Microsoft the admin has to click enable button once he open the report. For which I mentioned them multiple times that admin will always trust the report as its coming from Trusted source which in this case is Microsoft and 95% of times he will click on Enable button and payload will be executed. Anyways lets start with the Vulnerability details, At the end of this document I will give a bonus trick on how to find publicly available ...

 Hi all, Recently I have faced an issue where I was sending windows logs to my logs collector, however the logs were sent in below format Timestamp, System Hostname , Event-ID, etc etc Since to resolve the hostname to IP address the collector needed access to local DNS server, but there is no local DNS :-P So there are 2 solutions. Create local DNS server, and add all the entries of all the hosts and point the logs collector to this local DNS. Find some work around to be implemented on all the server so it can convert the hostname to its local IP before forwarding it to the logs collector. After googling for around 4-5 hrs. I wasn't able to find any proper solution, every solution which I was reading were converting IP to hostname. So I started reading the documentations of NXLOG and found a core function which can be used to convert the Hostname to Host IP.  Lets assume you have already configured the INPUT entity in the NXLOG config file and you know which logs to be co...

 So As discussed in Part 1, the 1APP has implemented another trick to avoid bypassing SSL Pinning. Before they were focusing on CA certificates present in device. Which we were able to bypass by putting our burpsuite certificate in CA directory. Now After update the Old trick was not working. To understand the implemented fix, I have decompile the APK again and In "resources\res\xml" directory I checked for "network\_security\_config.xml" after reviewing the XML file I Saw a new entry like <trust-anchors>             <certificates src="@raw/myAPP"/> </trust-anchors> This means that they have embedded their own certificate in "\resources\res\raw" directory with "myAPP" name. which means that application will not accept any certificate (CA/system or User) from device, it will only use myAPP certificate which is embedded in APK. I have tried multiple attempts to bypass it however every time I manipulate the APK file and tri...

 Hi everyone as you are aware I update this blog when I get stuck in some situation and after multiple attempts if I bypass that situation I write a blog about it. So today we will be discussing multiple issues which I faced while bypassing SSL pinning in one Application. lets call it 1APP So 1APP is configured in a way that normal installing burpsuite certificate in Andriod was not working. Running the application with normal burp certificate it was giving error like "java.security.cert.certpathvalidatorexception" webhook etc. After decompiling the app using online tools or you can use APKTOOL. In "resources\res\xml" directory I checked for "network\_security\_config.xml" after reviewing the XML file it was clear application is only trusting those certificate which are installed in CA directory of Device. So it was cleared that we have to copy our certificate to Android CA directory. After alot of searching I came across an awesome article where he explaine...

 Dear reader, While testing different features of TEAMS, I find out a CSV injection vulnerability in TEAMS Webinar feature, where any external user, or attacker can register himself for attending public webinar and in webinar registration page he can inject a malicious payload which will executed once the admin download the attendees list. As per Microsoft they are not accepting it as high/medium security bug (which I totally Disagree) and not eligible for bounty or hall of fame, also they provided the permission to disclose this publicly.  As per Microsoft the admin has to click enable button once he open the report. For which I mentioned them multiple times that admin will always trust the report as its coming from Trusted source which in this case is Microsoft and 95% of times he will click on Enable button and payload will be executed. Anyways lets start with the Vulnerability details, At the end of this document I will give a bonus trick on how to find publicly available ...

Dear Reader, I was able to identify stored XSS in multiple web base modules of Ericsson BSCS iX R18 Billing & Rating platform  Below are its details: # Software description: Ericsson Billing is a convergent billing solution for telecoms that combines an unrivaled combination of out-of-the box features and high configurability. As an evolution of the widely-installed Ericsson BSCS iX, Ericsson Billing provides a low-risk but effective route to capture and secure revenue streams and take advantage of business opportunities from both traditional telecom services as well as digital services, 5G and IoT. # Technical Details & Impact: There are multiple web base modules in BSCS iX e.g. ADMX, MX (monitoring center), CX etc. It was observed that ADMX and MX are vulnerable to stored XSS, In most test cases session hijacking was also possible by utilizing the XSS vulnerability. This potentially allows for full account takeover, or exploiting admin's browsers using beef...
