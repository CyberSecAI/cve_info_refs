Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a CSV injection vulnerability within the NetSkope Admin UI. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user input in the username field within audit logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data that is later exported to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas or commands.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When an administrator downloads the audit log as a CSV file and opens it, the injected malicious payload gets executed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the admin's machine, as the user is likely to trust the downloaded file and enable macros or active content.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the administrator's system and potentially further access to the network

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Attempt:** An attacker makes a login attempt to the NetSkope Admin UI and injects a malicious payload into the username field.
*   **CSV Export:** The administrator exports the audit logs into a CSV file.
*   **Malicious Payload Execution:** When the administrator opens the CSV file, the spreadsheet software executes the injected payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Netskope Admin UI, meaning they need network access to the system.
*  **Knowledge of CSV Injection:** The attacker needs to know how to craft CSV payloads for code execution in spreadsheet software.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in NetSkope Admin UI version 75.0.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in later versions of NetSkope.
*   The blog post provides specific steps and screenshots to demonstrate the exploit.
*  The payload used for the test case was a non-malicious payload, but the attacker could have used a malicious payload for code execution on the admin's machine.
