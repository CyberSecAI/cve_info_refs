  "cve": "CVE-2020-28501",
  "description": "The es6-crawler-detect package before 3.1.3 for Node.js is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). No limitation of user agent string length supplied to regex operators.",
  "affected_versions": "<3.1.3",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a regular expression used in the package being susceptible to catastrophic backtracking when processing crafted user-agent strings. This occurs because the regex contains nested quantifiers and alternations which can cause the regex engine to explore a large number of possible matching paths, leading to excessive CPU consumption and potential denial of service.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted user-agent string that triggers catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine. This will lead to excessive CPU consumption, making the service unresponsive to legitimate users.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Network"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction and can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted user-agent strings via network requests."
