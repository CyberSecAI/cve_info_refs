{
  "CVE-2020-28241": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer over-read has been found in libmaxminddb, an IP geolocation database library. This could be exploited when the mmdblookup tool is used to open a specially crafted database file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper initialization in the `bytes_to_hex` function within `maxminddb.c`. When the size argument to this function is zero, it allocates memory using `malloc` without initializing it. Later, this uninitialized memory is passed to `fprintf`, resulting in a heap-based buffer over-read when printing the uninitialized hex string.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read",
       "Improper memory initialization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) by enticing a user to process a specially crafted database file. This could lead to a crash of the application using `libmaxminddb`.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted MaxMind DB file using the `mmdblookup` tool or any application linked to `libmaxminddb`.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious MaxMind DB file and trick a user or application into processing it."
