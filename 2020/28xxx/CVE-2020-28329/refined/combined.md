KL-001-2020-004 : Barco wePresent Hardcoded API Credentials
Title: Barco wePresent Hardcoded API Credentials
Advisory ID: KL-001-2020-004
Publication Date: 2020.11.20
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-004.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: Barco
Affected Product: wePresent WiPG-1600W
Affected Version: 2.5.1.8, 2.5.0.25, 2.5.0.24, 2.4.1.19
Platform: Embedded Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
CVE ID: CVE-2020-28329
2. Vulnerability Description
Barco wePresent device firmware includes a hardcoded API
account and password that is discoverable by inspecting the
firmware image. A malicious actor could use this password to
access authenticated, administrative functions in the API.
3. Technical Description
This vulnerability concerns the existence of default, hardcoded
credentials that can be used to access an API service listening
on port 4001/tcp.
The password exists in clear text in /etc/lighthttp/admin and in
a hashed form in etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.user. This information
was obtained by downloading the firmware from wePresent's
site and unpacking the firmware. URL for the firmware is
https://www.barco.com/en/support/wepresent-wipg-1600W/drivers.
Binwalk, with recursive scanning of extracted files, only
partially unpacks the firmware. We devised a way to gracefully
unpack the firmware using 'dd', see KL-001-2020-009 for
further details.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
The vendor has released an updated firmware (2.5.3.12) which
remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
notes are available at:
https://www.barco.com/en/support/software/R33050104
