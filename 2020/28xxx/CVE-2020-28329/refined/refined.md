Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of hardcoded API credentials (username and password) within the firmware of Barco wePresent devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of default, hardcoded credentials for accessing the API service. This allows anyone who discovers these credentials to bypass authentication.
*   The credentials exist in clear text in `/etc/lighthttp/admin` and in a hashed form in `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.user` within the firmware image.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A malicious actor can use the hardcoded credentials to access administrative functions within the API. This could allow the attacker to:
    *   Potentially gain full control of the device.
    *   Modify device settings.
    *   Access sensitive information handled by the device.
    *   Use the device as a point for further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Firmware Analysis:** The attack vector involves downloading the device firmware from the vendor's website and extracting the hardcoded credentials from the filesystem.
*   **API Access:** Once the credentials are recovered, the attacker can use them to authenticate with the API service listening on port 4001/tcp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Firmware:** The attacker needs to be able to download the vulnerable firmware from the vendor's website.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs some technical skills to extract the firmware and locate the hardcoded credentials by using tools such as binwalk and 'dd' to unpack the firmware and examine file system.
*   **Network Access:** Once the credentials are recovered, the attacker would need network access to the targeted device to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of the wePresent WiPG-1600W device firmware.
*   The advisory mentions a specific process to unpack the firmware which involves using `dd`, indicating a non-standard archive format.
