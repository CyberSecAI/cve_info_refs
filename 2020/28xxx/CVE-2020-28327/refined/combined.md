Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2020-001

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Remote crash in res\_pjsip\_session |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Denial of service |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote authenticated sessions |
| **Severity** | Moderate |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | August 31, 2020 |
| **Reported By** | Sandro Gauci |
| **Posted On** | November 5, 2020 |
| **Last Updated On** | November 6, 2020 |
| **Advisory Contact** | kharwell AT sangoma DOT com |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2020-28327 |

| **Description** | Upon receiving a new SIP Invite, Asterisk did not return the created dialog locked or referenced. This caused a âgapâ between the creation of the dialog object, and its next use by the thread that created it. Depending upon some off nominal circumstances, and timing it was possible for another thread to free said dialog in this âgapâ. Asterisk could then crash when the dialog object, or any of its dependent objects were de-referenced, or accessed next by the initial creation thread.    Note, however that this crash can only occur when using a connection oriented protocol (e.g. TCP, TLS) for the SIP transport. If you are using UDP then your system should not be affected.    As well, the remote client must be authenticated, or Asterisk must be configured for anonymous calling in order for this problem to manifest. |
| **Modules Affected** | res\_pjsip.c, res\_pjsip\_session.c, res\_pjsip\_pubsub.c |

| **Resolution** | Asterisk now returns the newly created dialog object both locked, and with its reference count increased. The lock, and added reference are then held until such a time it is safe to release both the lock, and decrement the reference count. |

| Description: | This is a crash within PJSIP whereby under heavy load the INVITE transaction on an INVITE session may not be set when sending a response, resulting in a crash. | | |
| Comments: | By: Asterisk Team (asteriskteam) 2020-08-31 09:32:52.019-0500This issue has been automatically restricted and set to a blocker due to being a security type issue. If this is not a security vulnerability issue it will be moved to the appropriate issue type when triaged.  ---   By: Sandro Gauci (sandrogauci) 2020-10-07 22:26:45.707-0500Let us know if you have any updates, we'll be happy to test a fix from our side.  ---   By: Joshua C. Colp (jcolp) 2020-10-08 03:36:36.393-0500A fix is still being worked on, there's no updates currently.  ---   By: Sandro Gauci (sandrogauci) 2020-10-08 03:53:59.018-0500no problem - thanks Joshua  ---   By: Kevin Harwell (kharwell) 2020-10-29 11:45:16.287-0500I've attach [^ASTERISK-29057-16.diff] that should resolve this issue. The patch is against the Asterisk 16 branch. If you need another version let me know.   Our testing has shown the patch does indeed resolve the issue reported here, but it also may have uncovered another issue. We are still investigating that.   Please test the patch to ensure it resolves this issue, and let us know if you run into any other problems.   Thanks!  ---   By: Kevin Harwell (kharwell) 2020-10-29 11:49:21.191-0500Also, I've attached [^AST-2020-001.pdf] for your review, which is a draft of the document that'll be published at release time.   Dates, and CVE to be filled in later, but if you see anything you feel needs more clarification please let me know.   Thanks!  ---   By: Sandro Gauci (sandrogauci) 2020-10-29 23:12:54.496-0500Thanks Kevin! We'll test (probably next week) and get back to you. Do let me know if there are updates to the patch  ---   By: Sandro Gauci (sandrogauci) 2020-11-04 00:19:48.086-0600Hello Kevin, thanks for the patch. We have tested it and are unable to reproduce the crashes that were previously observed. I think the issue has been fixed. Indeed there may be other problems as we are seeing 503s but still need to investigate. One issue at a time :-)   As for AST-2020-001.pdf - thanks for that. We would disagree with the susceptibility being necessarily "Remote authenticated sessions" since this is dependent on configuration. But you do in fact highlight this in the description. So, it's probably clear enough for those who have such configuration.   Do you have a release date yet?  ---   By: Kevin Harwell (kharwell) 2020-11-04 15:28:57.680-0600Hi Sandro,   Thanks for testing out the patch, and confirming it fixed things. It's much appreciated.  {quote}  Do you have a release date yet?  {quote}  The plan is to release it tomorrow, November 5, 2020 if there are no other delays.  ---   By: Sandro Gauci (sandrogauci) 2020-11-04 21:53:20.343-0600Hi Kevin, thanks for the answers!
