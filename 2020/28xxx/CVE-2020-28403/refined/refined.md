{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection within the Star Practice Management Web application. This allows an attacker to manipulate user privileges by sending unauthorized requests on behalf of a legitimate user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to change the privileges of any user in the application. This includes granting themselves administrative privileges or removing administrative accounts. Consequently, the attacker can gain full control of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious web page or email containing a forged request. If a logged-in user visits this malicious page or opens the email, the browser will automatically send the request to the vulnerable application without the user's consent.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user of the Star Practice Management Web application to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious email. The attacker also needs to know the request format used to change user privileges."
