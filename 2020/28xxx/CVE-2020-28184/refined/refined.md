Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-28184:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization when handling HTTP Host headers and GET parameters within the TerraMaster TOS web interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web interface
  - Phishing attacks
  - Malicious redirects

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated XSS via the HTTP Host header on port 80:
  - An attacker can craft a malicious Host header containing JavaScript code.
- Authenticated XSS via GET parameter:
  - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the 'mod' parameter of the `/module/index.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the Host header XSS, the attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable port (80) of the TerraMaster TOS device.
- For the GET parameter XSS, the attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page after authentication.
- The attacker needs to know the IP address or domain name of the vulnerable TerraMaster device.
