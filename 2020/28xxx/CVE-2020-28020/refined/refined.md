Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28020:

**Root Cause:**

- Integer overflow in the `header_size` variable within the `receive_msg()` function. This overflow occurs when processing overly large mail headers containing only continuation lines (lines starting with a newline followed by space or tab).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The `header_size` variable, intended to track the size of the mail header being read, is multiplied by two (`header_size *= 2;`) without sufficient checks, leading to an integer overflow. When header_size becomes negative (INT_MIN), it causes a failure in memory allocation.

- **Bypass of Header Size Limit:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the 1MB header size limit by sending only continuation lines, which increments the size. This leads to the integer overflow.

- **Memory Corruption:** The integer overflow leads to memory corruption by causing a negative value for header_size, which is then used for memory allocation (`store_get(header_size)`). This results in a back-jump to the beginning of heap memory.

- **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution:** The memory corruption vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary remote code execution by carefully crafting specific SMTP commands and headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the "exim" user.
-   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** This vulnerability allows a full takeover of the mail server, and compromise of all communications passing through it.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted email over an SMTP connection.
- **SMTP Commands:** Specifically, the attacker sends SMTP commands like `EHLO`, `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, `DATA` along with an oversized header section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to an Exim server that is vulnerable.
- **SMTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs an understanding of SMTP protocol to interact with the mail server.
- **Crafting Email Headers:** The attacker must be able to craft emails with specific headers and continuation lines to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Versions Affected:** All Exim versions before 4.92 are vulnerable.
-   **Exploitation Details:** The exploit involves three stages:
    1.  **Memory Layout Manipulation**: Allocating three 1GB mmap blocks, overflowing the last one.
    2.  **Heap Manipulation**: Creating a fake storeblock structure to overwrite the heap, to get arbitrary write access.
    3.  **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Leveraging the write access to leak a libc pointer, and gain arbitrary code execution through system().
-   **Exploit Complexity:** The vulnerability is complex to exploit. Specifically, the integer overflow results in a negative header size and a corresponding negative free size. This limits the ways that the memory corruption can be controlled
-  **Memory Management:** Exploitation of this vulnerability leverages the specific behaviors of Exim's memory allocation system (`store.c`).
-   **Specific Patches:** The commit "56ac062a3ff94fc4e1bbfc2293119c079a4e980b" addresses the vulnerability by adding an integer overflow check in the header parsing routine
