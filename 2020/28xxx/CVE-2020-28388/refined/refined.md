Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-28388:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Nucleus RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) TCP/IP stack (Nucleus NET) where the Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufficiently random source.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Predictable ISNs:**  The ISNs generated for TCP connections are not sufficiently random, making them predictable. This predictability is the core vulnerability.
- **CWE-342: Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values** This CWE precisely describes the weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially hijack existing TCP sessions by predicting the ISNs.
- **Session Spoofing:** An attacker can also spoof future TCP connections.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As a consequence of session hijacking, it could result in a denial-of-service condition by disrupting legitimate network communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):**  An attacker with a privileged position on the network can intercept the TCP traffic to observe and predict the ISNs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device to intercept traffic.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for authentication.
- **Technical Skills:** An attacker must have the technical skills to analyze network traffic, predict ISNs and inject malicious packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Siemens products using Nucleus RTOS, including APOGEE PXC and TALON TC field panels and PLUSCONTROL 1st Gen devices.
- Siemens recommends updating to the latest versions of the affected products where available.
- Where updates are not available, they suggest mitigations such as protecting transmitted data with cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS).
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Daniel dos Santos from Forescout Technologies.
- Specific countermeasures may be needed based on the deployment of the affected product
- The vulnerability is also referenced in Forescout "NUMBER:JACK" publication.
