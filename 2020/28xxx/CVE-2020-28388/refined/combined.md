GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series devices are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

TALON TC Modular and Compact Series devices are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the TALON Automation System.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15795

The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the names in DNS-
responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a write past the end of an allocated

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Nucleus NET module incorporates a wide range of standard-compliant networking and communication
protocols, drivers, and utilities to deliver full-featured network support in any embedded device. The
networking functionality is fully integrated into the Nucleus RTOS and supports a variety of processors
and MCUs.

Nucleus ReadyStart is a platform with integrated software IP, tools, and services ideal for applications
where a small footprint, deterministic performance, and small code size are essential.

Nucleus RTOS is a highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for scalability
and reliability in systems spanning the range of aerospace, industrial, and medical applications. Since
V3, Nucleus RTOS (incl. its modules, e.g. Nucleus NET) is an integral part of the Nucleus ReadyStart
platform.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• PLUSCONTROL devices are typically located in a separate LAN segment of energy transmission
solutions, where an attacker could use this vulnerability to disrupt SER messages or Trace function-
alities. Therefore, review the status of the defense in depth recommendations that apply to your
speciﬁc deployment and align as needed. Especially the measures on the network layer to prevent
accessibility from other network segments.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

PLUSCONTROL products from Siemens Energy are control devices for high power energy transmission
with modular multilevel converters.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28388

Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufﬁciently random
source. As a result, the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker
could hijack existing sessions or spoof future ones.
