Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2020-11728**

*   **Root Cause:** The session key generation in `Session::__construct()` uses the current microsecond time, making it predictable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficiently random session key generation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who can guess the microsecond timestamp and the session\_id can impersonate a legitimate user's session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs to be able to predict the microsecond timestamp of session creation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to observe or predict the microsecond time of the session creation and the session ID.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of the current time in microseconds as part of the session key, specifically within the SQL query used for session verification.
*   The flawed logic was in the `(md5(session.session_start::text) = ? OR` clause, which should be removed.
