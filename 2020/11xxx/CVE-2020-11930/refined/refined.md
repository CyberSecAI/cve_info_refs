Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11930

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the GTranslate plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin did not properly sanitize URLs used in hreflang tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin was vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of sanitization of URLs used in hreflang attributes. This means an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
- **Potential Account Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially gain access to user accounts by stealing cookies or performing other malicious actions with the injected script.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the website's content and appearance.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites or attempt to install malware on their devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link Generation:** An attacker would generate a malicious link containing JavaScript code within the URL, particularly crafted to exploit the vulnerability in hreflang tags.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to entice a victim into clicking on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Craft Malicious URL:** An attacker would need the ability to craft a malicious URL with embedded javascript code, targeting the plugin's vulnerability in hreflang tag generation.
- **Distribute Malicious Link:** An attacker needs a method to distribute the crafted link to potential victims, usually through social engineering or other means.
- **Target Specific Plugin Configuration:** The vulnerability is specifically noted to affect sub-domain or sub-directory paid options with hreflang tags enabled, which means that the plugin must be configured this way on a targeted website.
- **Victim with Old Browser:** The attacker requires a victim with an older browser (<= IE 9) without proper URL encoding support.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8.52 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was only possible for sub-domain or sub-directory paid options with hreflang tags enabled.
