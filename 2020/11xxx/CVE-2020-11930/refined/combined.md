For SEO features and multilingual SEO you need to go with a paid version which have all the SEO advantages. Our paid version will translate your website and allow search engines to discover and index the translated content.

Unlike other translate plugins, we provide you all the possible tools to match with your multilingual SEO strategy.

For example you can have your translated content available via sub-directories (https://example.com/es, https://example.com/fr) or sub-domains (https://it.example.com, https://fr.example.com) or even you can host the translated versions on a top level country specific domain or any other domain like (https://example.fr, https://example.de), which will increase your chances to rank higher in local search engine’s results pages.

### What is multilingual SEO?

Multilingual SEO is a SEO strategy which uses new content generation technique by translating your original content and making your website multilingual. When you translate your website into many languages you actually create many new multilingual keywords targeted for international market.

For example http://example.com/*about-us* → http://example.com/*sobre-nosotros*

This is an important part of multilingual SEO strategy. When you have URL Translate option and translate also your website URLs also known us slugs, you are creating more keywords, which count as an improvement in your page rank for that keywords.

### Does it translate emails too?

Yes, with our paid version we can also translate WooCommerce emails.

### How the free version differs from the paid versions?

Free vesion is a nice looking language selector you can place on your website. It has a built in Javascript engine which allows to translate your website automatically to multiple languages. With our free translate plugin your website URL doesn’t change and the translations are not stored. While paid versions are a translation proxy also known as Translation Delivery Network. We host the translated versions of your website on our cloud network under a language specific domain. In that case every language will have a separate domain or separate URL and be indexed in search engines, which will help you to increase international traffic and sales.

### What is a Translation Delivery Network?

Translation Delivery Network is a translation proxy which mirrors your website in different languages.

GTranslate TDN technology is a cloud-based approach to the website translation task. There is no need to alter your environment and install software to localize your website. You can have your multilingual website up and running in less than 5 minutes.

We will translate your content and host your translations in our cloud network. All the visits to your translated versions will be proxied through our network to your original website, so you will have a translated mirror of your website.

This keeps away the need to use additional resources on your server like storage to store translations, compute time to render the translated pages or network bandwidth to deliver the translated pages to your website visitors. All is done through our network.

### Can I exclude some parts from being translated?

Yes, you need to wrap the text you don’t want to be translated with <span class="notranslate"></span>.

With our paid versions you will have more control on the content which you do not want to translate. We have Skip Phrases, Skip Translations by CSS selectors and also Skip Pages features available.

### Which plugins can it translate?

All plugins are supported including popular plugins like WooCommerce, Yoast SEO.

Our technology allows us to translate what is visible on the page, since we are parsing the end result when your website is already generated and it doesn’t matter how the content is generated and by which plugin. We can translate all HTML websites.

If you notice that something is not translated, please contact our live chat and we will be happy to solve any issues. Usually the not translated content is being loaded on your website from 3rd party sources.

We also offer you to change the images and media content on the translated versions and by doing that you can also translate the texts inside images and videos.

### How Translation Delivery Network works?

You just need to change your DNS records to add sub-domains or domains dedicated to your languages to our Translation Delivery Network.

So when someone visits the new added sub-domain we will show the translated clone of your website.

After that you can just configure and place the GTranslate Free widget on your site to enable language selection.

### What are the server requirements?

There are no server requirements! Your website can be written in any programming language and hosted on any web server.

### What about updates?

Updates are done seamlessly. Since the translations are hosted on our server we take care about updates. You just use up to date service every day. No need to worry about backups.

### Do I need to pay for Google Translate API key usage?

No, we provide the automatic translations for free.

In our free version we provide Phrase Based machine translations from Google Translate. While in our paid versions we provide you state of the art Neural Translations from Google Translate. We also do not have limits on the number of words on your website unlike other translate plugins.

Yes, we have a 15 days free trial for our new customers.

### How does the 15 day free trial work for your paid version?

Trial is available for new customers only. If you do not wish to continue you may cancel any time during the trial period and you will not be charged anything.

### How can I be sure that search engines will index my website translations?

### [Surprisingly good free translation for WP](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/surprisingly-good-free-translation-for-wp/)

[degfra](https://profiles.wordpress.org/degfra/ "Posts by degfra")
January 16, 2025

The quality of the machine translations is more then acceptable : it is suprisingly good for a free plugin. Another posive point of this free tool is that it is possible to NOT translate certain HTML items, simply by giving them a “notranslate” class name – this is extremely useful for avoiding the out of place translation of institutional names.
Great for web site development on a tight budget : I recently switched from Weglot to Gtranslate Free because my client could not afford that commercial solution anymore – and she is totally satisfied with the translations it deliveres.For specialized web sites with specific terminologies – technical or legal for instance – the free GTranslate plugin might not be sufficient though.
