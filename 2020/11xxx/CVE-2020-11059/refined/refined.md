Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `aegir publish` and `aegir build` commands in the `aegir` npm package. These commands inadvertently included environment variables in the browser bundle that was published to npm.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Environment variables often contain sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets. Including them in the browser bundle made them accessible to anyone who downloaded or used the affected package.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Filtering:** The build process did not properly sanitize or filter out environment variables before including them in the final bundle.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Leakage:** Attackers could potentially extract sensitive credentials from the leaked environment variables, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to systems, APIs, or other resources.
*   **Security Breaches:** If the leaked secrets were related to infrastructure or other sensitive systems, an attacker could potentially use them to launch further attacks or gain control over those systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Package Consumption:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by simply downloading the affected versions of the `aegir` package from npm, extracting the leaked secrets from the generated bundle.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:**  If a compromised package contains secrets, downstream projects using that package become vulnerable, potentially expanding the impact of the leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic knowledge of npm and JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to download and unpack npm packages.
*   **Access to the vulnerable package:** The attacker needs to be aware of or discover the existence of the vulnerable package version on npm or other sources.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was specific to `aegir` versions greater than or equal to `21.7.0` and was patched in version `21.10.1`.
*   The advisory suggests users run `printenv` to check their environment variables and revoke any secrets that may have been exposed.
