{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-11048",
  "description": "In FreeRDP after 1.0 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds read. It only allows to abort a session. No data extraction is possible.",
  "affected_versions": "> 1.0 and < 2.0.0",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to missing boundary checks within the rdp_read_flow_control_pdu function when processing a flow control PDU. Specifically, the function reads 1 byte and seeks forward by 5 bytes without validating that the remaining stream length is sufficient for these operations, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by forcing the FreeRDP client to abort the session.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "A malicious RDP server can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted flow control PDU, causing an out-of-bounds read on the client."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "Attacker needs to control or be a malicious RDP server."
  ],
    "additional_information": "The issue is located in `libfreerdp/core/rdp.c` in the `rdp_read_flow_control_pdu` function. The fix was implemented in commit `9301bfe730c66180263248b74353daa99f5a969b` by adding boundary checks in the `rdp_read_flow_control_pdu` function and making it return a boolean. The function `rdp_read_share_control_header` is also updated to handle the boolean return value."
