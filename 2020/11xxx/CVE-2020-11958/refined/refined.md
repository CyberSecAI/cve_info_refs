Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `Scanner::fill` function within `src/parse/scanner.cc`. The root cause is an incorrect calculation of the shift offset when a long lexeme doesn't fit into the buffer and forces buffer reallocation. This results in data not being discarded properly, leading to less free space than expected, and ultimately a buffer overflow when new data is written.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Incorrect calculation of shift offset during buffer reallocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to the crash caused by the buffer overflow.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, as stated in Ubuntu Security Notices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafting a specially designed input file containing a long lexeme that triggers the buffer reallocation and subsequent overflow in `re2c`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to `re2c`.
- No specific privilege is mentioned, the vulnerability can be triggered by a normal user by running the tool with a crafted input file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `1edd26a35457c5835afd58b8fa8330d33e7a1192`, although the logical error was introduced earlier in commit `2f3e597abce36fb7f41413373308b7f13fc98181`. The fix is in commit `c4603ba5ce229db83a2a4fb93e6d4b4e3ec3776a`.
- The issue was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The bug was reproducible by providing a crafted file.
- The vulnerability affects `re2c` versions prior to the fix.
- Patches were issued for Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) and 20.04 LTS (focal).
- Gentoo's advisory indicates that versions of `dev-util/re2c` less than 1.3-r1 are affected and version 1.3-r1 or greater are unaffected.
