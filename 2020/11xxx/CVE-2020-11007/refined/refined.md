Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from inadequate input validation of the quantity parameter when adding items to the shopping cart. Specifically, the application failed to prevent users from entering a negative quantity for items.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation on the quantity parameter. This allowed users to input negative values for item quantities.
*   **Logic Error:** The application's business logic did not account for negative quantities when processing shopping cart and order totals.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Incorrect Shopping Cart and Order Totals:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could create shopping carts with negative quantities, leading to incorrect calculations of the total cost. This could result in the attacker getting items for free or at a reduced cost.
*   **Potential Business Disruption:** The incorrect order totals could lead to financial discrepancies for the business and disrupt normal business operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** Attackers could use API requests to directly submit negative values for item quantities.
*   **Controller Based Manipulation:** Attackers could use controller-based endpoints to submit negative values for item quantities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send requests to the application, either directly via API calls or via the web application's controller endpoints.
*   **Basic Understanding of the Application:** The attacker would need to know the relevant API endpoints or controller routes to target for the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 2.11.0 of the Shopizer e-commerce application are affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.11.0 by adding a back-end validation that sets negative quantities to 1.

**CVE Details:**
*   The vulnerability is registered under **CVE-2020-11007**
