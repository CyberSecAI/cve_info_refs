Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11039:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

   - The content from `github.com_8701cadd` and `www.suse.com_a10b0b53` explicitly mention CVE-2020-11039 and its impact on FreeRDP. The description in these sources match the official CVE description.
   - The other sources confirm that the vulnerability was fixed in FreeRDP version 2.1.0 and mention the related bugzilla entry 1171441.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause:** Integer overflows in length checks within the USB redirection channel.
   - **Weaknesses:**
        -  The vulnerability exists due to missing validation/sanitization of length values received from the server during USB redirection. Integer overflows occur during size calculation, leading to the allocation of smaller-than-expected buffers, and subsequent out-of-bounds write.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
        - **Arbitrary Memory Read and Write:** A manipulated server can instruct the client to read/write to almost any memory location on the client machine due to an integer overflow, leading to arbitrary memory access on the client.
        - **Client Crash:**  Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the FreeRDP client due to out-of-bounds operations.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - **Network (Man-in-the-Middle or Malicious Server):**  A malicious or compromised RDP server can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted USB redirection messages to the client, triggering the overflow and subsequent out-of-bounds access.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         - The attacker needs control of the RDP server or be in a man-in-the-middle position to manipulate server responses.
         - The attacker needs to have a session established with the vulnerable client, with USB redirection enabled in the client

**3. Additional Details:**

  - The Suse page provides a CVSS v2 score of 6 and CVSS v3 score of 8, indicating that the severity of the issue is high.
   - The GitHub advisory notes the vulnerability impacts "All FreeRDP based clients, all platforms".
   - The workaround includes deactivating USB redirection.
   - The openSUSE mailing list confirms the fix was included in the 2.1.2 release and references Bugzilla entry 1171441.
   - The Debian LTS advisory confirms the vulnerability was fixed in freerdp2 version 2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb10u3 and provides a long list of related CVEs that were also fixed in the same release.

**4. Summary of extracted information:**

   CVE-2020-11039 is a serious vulnerability in FreeRDP caused by integer overflows when handling USB redirection. A compromised server can exploit this to perform arbitrary memory read/write, leading to potential information disclosure, code execution, or client crashes. Users are advised to disable USB redirection as a short term workaround or upgrade to FreeRDP version 2.1.0 or later versions which patch the vulnerability.
