The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0535, affecting multiple router, gateway, and WiFi system models. Although the advisory does not mention CVE-2020-11786, the details are relevant because the document provides information about a stored XSS.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the web interface of the listed NETGEAR devices.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server. When a user accesses the affected page, the malicious script is executed within their browser.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit an affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    * Stealing user session cookies.
    * Defacing the web page.
    * Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * Performing actions on behalf of the user.
* **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to inject the malicious script into the affected device. This would likely involve manipulating input fields or other parameters accessible to a user via the router's configuration interface.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with access to the router's configuration interface can inject malicious scripts. This could involve:
     * A compromised local device that can access the router's management interface.
     * An attacker with access to the local network, either by being physically present or through a previous compromise.
     * An attacker who has gained access to a user account with administrative privileges on the device.
