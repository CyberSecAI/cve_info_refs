Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11516

**Root Cause:** The Contact Form 7 Datepicker plugin's AJAX action for processing datepicker settings lacked both a capability check and a nonce check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-provided input allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings.
*   **Missing Capability Check:** The plugin did not verify if the user initiating the AJAX request had the necessary permissions to modify the settings.
*   **Missing Nonce Check:** The plugin did not use a nonce to verify the authenticity of the AJAX request, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful attack would result in the execution of the attacker's malicious JavaScript code in the browser of an authorized user (e.g., administrator) when they create or modify a contact form.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal an administrator's session cookies, giving the attacker control of the admin account.
*   **Malicious User Creation:** The attacker could also create malicious administrative users, potentially compromising the entire website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is initiated through a crafted AJAX request.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with minimal permissions (e.g., a subscriber).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be a registered user of the WordPress site.
*   The attacker must be able to craft and send AJAX requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
* The plugin was closed and removed from the WordPress plugin repository due to this vulnerability.
* The plugin is no longer maintained, and there will likely be no patch available.
* The Wordfence firewall protects against this vulnerability.
* It is recommended to deactivate and remove the plugin.
