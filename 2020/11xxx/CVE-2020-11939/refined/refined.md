Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the `concat_hash_string` function within the `ssh.c` file of the nDPI library. This function is responsible for parsing SSH KEXINIT messages and extracting string sets. The vulnerability arises due to how the `offset` variable is updated based on a length field from the packet. The offset is a 16-bit integer, while the length is a 32-bit integer. The code adds the length value to the offset which could cause an overflow. This is then truncated to fit into the 16 bit offset variable. This allows for the offset to be manipulated and to bypass bounds checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Integer Overflow:** The 32-bit length value read from the packet is added to a 16-bit offset, and the result is truncated, leading to an integer overflow.
2.  **Heap Overflow:** By controlling the length values within the SSH KEXINIT packet, an attacker can manipulate the `offset` within the `concat_hash_string` function. This manipulated offset is then used with `strncpy` to repeatedly write to the heap buffer `buf`. The destination offset into `buf` is controlled by `buf_out_len` which can be increased without bounds checks which leads to a heap overflow.
3. **Missing Bounds Checks:** The `buf_out_len` variable is not checked against the allocated size of the buffer before performing the `strncpy` operation

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The heap overflow vulnerability can be exploited to achieve RCE. The attacker can craft a malicious SSH KEXINIT packet that, when parsed by nDPI, causes a heap overflow, overwriting heap metadata and potentially executing arbitrary code.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not the primary impact of this CVE, an attacker could also leverage the integer overflow to cause a DoS by corrupting memory and causing a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The vulnerability can be exploited via network traffic. A malicious SSH KEXINIT packet is sent to the target system running nDPI.
*   **Remote:** The attack is remote as the vulnerable code is processing network packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system where nDPI is running.
*   **Knowledge of SSH Protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid SSH KEXINIT message with manipulated length fields.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in the 3.0-stable release of nDPI.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `concat_hash_string` function located in `src/lib/protocols/ssh.c`.
*   The `strncpy` is used to copy data into the heap buffer without sufficient bounds checking.
*   The `client_hash` variable is used to control whether a client or server string is being copied, but the overflow issue is present for both server and client.
*   The `offset` integer overflow can be used to repeatedly copy a single string into the heap buffer `buf` to cause the overflow
*   The destination buffer `buf` is allocated based on packet length via `calloc` which can be controlled.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of SSH KEXINIT messages (message code 20).
*   The vulnerability can be triggered in both client-to-server and server-to-client directions.
*   The fix involved adding additional checks against overflows.
* An additional integer overflow issue affecting 32bit platforms was reported by @rhuizer (Ronald Huizer).

The provided content describes the vulnerability in detail, explaining how the integer overflow allows for the bypass of bounds checks, leading to the heap overflow. The advisory also mentions a related out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CVE-2020-11940) that can lead to denial of service but this is not part of the description for CVE-2020-11939
