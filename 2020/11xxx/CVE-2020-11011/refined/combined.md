### SECURITY.md

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since our team is small, and we don't update often, we only support the latest release of Phproject. It is highly recommended that you update whenever we release a new version, as it likely includes major bug fixes, and can impact the security of your site.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find an issue with the security of Phproject, you may report the vulnerability on [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose), or let me know personally via email at alan@phpizza.com. If emailing, I recommend encrypting your communication with [my PGP public key](https://keybase.io/alanaktion/pgp_keys.asc).

I'll do my best to get back to you within 48 hours, at least with an idea of when we can fix the issue. Major issues that involve significant changes to the application can take several weeks since no one works on this project full time, but we'll do what we can to fix things.

If it's been more than a week and we haven't replied, or if we have replied but it's been a while and we haven't communicated or fixed the issue you found, let us know and we'll invite you to a private fork where we can collaborate on a fix.

# RCE via file upload

High

GHSA-4j97-6w6q-gxjx
Apr 20, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.7.7

## Patched versions

1.7.8

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows users with access to file uploads to execute arbitrary code.

### Patches

This vulnerability has preventions in place in the latest code. It is still possible to exploit if the environment is configured outside of the recommended way, with the web server configuration not preventing execution, and the Phproject file type blacklist being altered or disabled.

### Workarounds

For users not able to update to Phproject 1.7.8, it is recommended to disallow PHP execution from the upload directory. On Apache, this can be done by creating a new `.htaccess` file in the `uploads` directory:

```
Deny from all
```

For nginx, add a regex location block for `/uploads` to your Phproject `server` block. This will be the last block evaluated for the match, preventing PHP code execution:

```
location ~ ^/uploads/ {
    deny all;
}
```

---

This exploit worked by uploading a .php file to an issue and determining its path from the webroot via the date and unix timestamp (which could take a few attempts if the server is out of sync, but is fairly trivial). The files were not meant to be directly accessible, as the application proxies access to them in all of the app-generated URLs, but the files are stored in a web accessible directory by default.

[@niebardzo](https://github.com/niebardzo) found this issue, demonstrated it on the [demo environment](https://demo.phproject.org), and disclosed the issue according to our [policy](https://github.com/Alanaktion/phproject/security/policy).

### Severity

### CVE ID
