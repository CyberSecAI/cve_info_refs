Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11011:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unrestricted file uploads, specifically the ability to upload and execute arbitrary code via PHP files. The application stored uploaded files in a web-accessible directory without proper restrictions on file types or execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allowed users to upload files without sufficient validation of file types, leading to the possibility of uploading executable code.
- **Lack of File Execution Prevention:** The uploaded files were stored in a directory accessible via the web server, and the webserver was not configured by default to prevent execution of uploaded PHP files.
- **Insufficient File Type Blacklisting:** Initially, the application lacked a file type blacklist for uploaded files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing a malicious PHP file, an attacker could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is uploading a malicious PHP file through the application's file upload functionality (specifically via issue attachments)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the file upload functionality. In this case, any user who could upload an attachment to an issue was able to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to determine the path to the uploaded file which can be achieved due to the files being named with timestamps and the uploads directory being web-accessible.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves adding a file type blacklist to prevent execution of uploaded files, specifically by blocking php related files.
- The fix also recommends preventing PHP execution from the upload directory via web server configuration (e.g. `.htaccess` for Apache or a location block in Nginx)
- The vulnerability was discovered by @niebardzo and disclosed according to the project's security policy.
- The advisory also mentions the application proxying access to uploaded files, but the files were stored in a web accessible directory by default.
