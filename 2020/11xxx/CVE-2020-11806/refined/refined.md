- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MailStore Outlook Add-in does not validate the TLS/SSL certificate presented by the server during the login process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing TLS/SSL certificate validation (CWE-295)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept network traffic and retrieve the user's login username and password if Standard Authentication is used.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network connection between the Outlook Add-in and the server. They do not need to possess a valid certificate.
