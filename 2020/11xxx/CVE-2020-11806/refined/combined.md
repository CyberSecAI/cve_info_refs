CVE-2020-11806: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11806
CWE-295: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html
Summary:
The login process of the affected products does not validate the TLS/SSL certificate presented by the server.
Effect:
To exploit a vulnerable Outlook Add-in, the user must use Standard Authentication as login method, so that username and password are transferred over the network.
An attacker may then be able to retrieve the login username and password of the user by intercepting the network connection, known as man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker does not need to be in the possession of a valid certificate, and thus can use an arbitrary certificate including a self-signed one.
If Windows Authentication, based on Kerberos tokens, is used as login method, the potential risk primarily depends on the defined security policies for the Kerberos tokens.
Attack type:
Remote
Attack vector(s):
\* Man-in-the-middle attack
Solution:
Update Outlook Add-in to version 12.1.3 or higher
