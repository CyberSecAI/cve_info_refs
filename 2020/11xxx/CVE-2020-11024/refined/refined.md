Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an error in the Moonlight iOS/tvOS client's pairing process with a GameStream server (GFE or Sunshine). During the initial pairing, the client generates a secret PIN, which is meant to be used later when deriving an AES key. However, the PIN was incorrectly concatenated to the end of the salt value *before* being sent to the server, instead of after. This resulted in the secret PIN being sent in the clear.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PIN Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the secret PIN during the pairing request due to improper concatenation with the salt.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The exposed PIN enables a MitM attack on the pairing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stealing Encryption Keys:** An attacker performing MitM can obtain the PIN, pair with the client as a legitimate server, and subsequently intercept stream encryption keys which are exchanged over HTTPS.
*   **Persistent Proxying:** The MitM can further manipulate host data exchanged during pairing, forcing the victim to connect to the attacker's proxy server even after leaving the attacker-controlled network. This allows the attacker to persistently intercept the victim's stream.
*   **Compromised Stream Security:** By intercepting the encryption keys, the attacker can potentially decrypt the video stream.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The primary attack vector is a MitM attack during the pairing process.
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the client and server during the pairing process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the Moonlight client and the GameStream server (GFE or Sunshine) during pairing.
*   **Timing:** The attacker has a small window to perform the MitM attack because pairing is a one time process.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Moonlight iOS/tvOS clients prior to version 4.0.1.
*   Other Moonlight clients (Qt, Android, ChromeOS, Embedded, and Vita) were not vulnerable.
*   The fix was released in version 4.0.1 and is available on the Apple App Store.
*   Users who paired over potentially insecure networks are advised to delete the PC from Moonlight and re-pair after updating.
*   The vulnerability is considered moderate severity.
*   The vulnerable code was located in `Limelight/Network/PairManager.m`.
* The fix was made by modifying how the PIN was used in the pairing process, so that it would not be sent to the server in clear text, resolving the vulnerability and preventing the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.
