Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11729:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `LSIDLogin()` function in the `awl` library generates long-term session cookies using an insecure method. The validation string used to generate the session key relies on easily guessed or known inputs like the user ID, username, and password (which can be empty or a default value in certain cases), along with a user-selected salt. This design flaw allows an attacker to predict or brute-force the session key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure session key generation:** The `LSIDLogin()` function uses a combination of user ID, username, password, and a user-selected salt to generate the session key. This method is insecure because user IDs and usernames are easily obtainable. The password might be known or easily guessed, especially for new users, and the attacker controls the salt value.
- **Lack of session timeout:** The generated long-term session cookies do not expire, making them vulnerable to theft and replay attacks. Once a cookie is stolen, it can be used indefinitely, unless the user's password is changed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate other users by forging or guessing their session cookies, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Brute-force attack:** An attacker can try to brute-force the session key by trying different salt values and easily guessed user information, and can then impersonate users.
- **Session cookie theft:** If an attacker manages to steal a valid session cookie (e.g., through a JavaScript XSS attack), they can use it to impersonate the victim user indefinitely, as the cookies do not expire.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Knowledge of user information:** Attackers need to know or be able to guess user IDs and usernames.
- **Ability to control the salt:** Since the salt is user-selected, an attacker can choose a specific salt value to use in their attack.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the web application.

In summary, CVE-2020-11729 highlights an insecure session management implementation in the `awl` library, specifically within the `LSIDLogin()` function, that can be exploited to impersonate users. The core issues are weak session key generation and lack of session expiration, which together increase the likelihood of successful user impersonation attacks.
