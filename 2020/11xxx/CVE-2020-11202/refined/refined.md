The provided content includes information about CVE-2020-11202, along with other related CVEs, within the context of vulnerabilities discovered in Qualcomm's Snapdragon DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chips.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from multiple issues:
  - Lack of version control for DSP libraries, allowing downgrade attacks by loading older vulnerable versions.
  - Bugs in the Hexagon SDK, which automatically generates vulnerable code in skeleton libraries, particularly when handling string arguments and in-out buffers with incorrect length validations (signed int issues leading to buffer overflows).
  - Vulnerabilities in QDI (QuRT Driver Invocation) drivers due to incorrect handling of parameters passed via the qurt_qdi_handle_invoke API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Downgrade Vulnerability:** The ability to load older, vulnerable versions of DSP libraries by manipulating the `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
  - **Memory Corruption:**  Heap overflows and out-of-bounds read/write issues caused by improper handling of buffer lengths and negative values within automatically generated code in skeleton libraries.
   -  **QDI Driver Vulnerabilities**: Multiple vulnerabilities within the QDI drivers that allow for kernel level reads and writes due to lack of proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - **Information Leakage:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data such as photos, videos, call recordings, microphone data, and GPS location.
  - **Denial of Service:** Attackers can render the device unresponsive and permanently unavailable (targeted denial-of-service).
  - **Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the DSP, bypassing signature requirements and potentially escalate privileges.
  - **Malware Hiding:** Ability for malware to conceal its activities and become unremovable.
  - **Kernel Panic/Reboot:** Triggering kernel panics can cause device reboots.
  - **Compromised Video/Voice Streams:** The cDSP is responsible for preprocessing video from camera sensors. Attackers can intercept or manipulate this flow.
  - **Full compromise of the DSP**: Through chaining together vulnerabilities in the User PD with driver vulnerabilities, the attacker can take full control over the DSP processor.

**Attack vectors:**
  - **Malicious Android Applications:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through malicious Android apps.
  - **Direct DSP invocation:** By skipping the stub code and directly using `remote_handle_open` and `remote_handle_invoke` functions, an attacker can craft malicious payloads to invoke vulnerable DSP functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious Android application.
  - The attacker must know or be able to identify vulnerable libraries present on the device, or be able to supply an older vulnerable library.
  - No specific user interaction beyond app installation is mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
  - The research revealed over 400 vulnerabilities in various DSP libraries.
  - The vulnerabilities affect devices from multiple vendors such as Google, Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, OnePlus, HTC and Sony.
  - Check Point Research developed a custom fuzzing framework using QEMU and AFL to discover these vulnerabilities.
  - Qualcomm has acknowledged and assigned CVEs to some of these issues and released a security patch, but did not assign CVEs for the QDI driver vulnerabilities.
