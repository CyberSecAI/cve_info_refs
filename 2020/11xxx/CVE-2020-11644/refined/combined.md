Vulnerability Details

CVE-2020-11641 SiteManager Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Description

SiteManager contains a Web application powering the Web GUI used to manage a SiteManager
instance. This Web application allows to read sensitive files located on a SiteManager instance.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can read service configuration and other sensitive information, potentially
abusing this information for malicious activities on SiteManager instances.

Fix

The Web application now denies to read local files from a SiteManager instance.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has not identified any specific workarounds or mitigations for this vulnerability.
Security solutions like Intrusion Prevention Systems and Web Application Firewalls may be able to
prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by blocking exploit traffic before it reaches SiteManager
instances. Further details are provided in our Cyber Security guidelines – see section "Supporting
information and guidelines" below.

CVE-2020-11642 SiteManager Denial of Service via Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Description

Abusing the Local File Inclusion Vulnerability outlined above may cause SiteManager instances to restart.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can repeatedly trigger a restart of SiteManager instances, thus limiting their
availability.

Fix

This vulnerability is a consequence of the Local File Inclusion Vulnerability - the fix for the Local File
Inclusion Vulnerability also fixes this vulnerability.

Workarounds and Mitigations

This vulnerability is a consequence of the Local File Inclusion Vulnerability – please check the respective
section of the parent vulnerability "CVE-2020-11641 SiteManager Local File Inclusion Vulnerability".

CVE-2020-11643 GateManager Information Disclosure Vulnerability

Description

On GateManager instances serving multiple, independent organizations, a vulnerability in the audit log
feature allows cross-domain access to information of foreign devices.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can gather information about devices belonging to a foreign organization,
potentially abusing this information for malicious activities.

Fix

The audit log code now prevents cross-domain access to device information.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has not identified any specific workarounds or mitigations for this vulnerability.

CVE-2020-11644 GateManager Audit Message Spoofing Vulnerability

Description

A vulnerability in the GateManager audit log feature may be abused to generate fake audit
messages/alerts.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can fool users of foreign domains with fictional audit messages/alerts of their
choice.

Fix

The audit log code no longer allows a user to write fictional audit messages/alerts to the audit log.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has not identified any specific workarounds or mitigations for this vulnerability.

CVE-2020-11645 GateManager Denial of Service Vulnerability

Description

A vulnerability in the GateManager Ping feature may cause a GateManager instance to restart.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can repeatedly trigger a restart of GateManager instances, thus limiting their
availability.

Fix

The code of the Ping feature has been fixed, eliminating the potential to cause a GateManager restart.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has not identified any specific workarounds or mitigations for this vulnerability.
