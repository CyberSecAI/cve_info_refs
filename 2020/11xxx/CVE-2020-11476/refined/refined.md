{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application allows an authenticated admin to specify uploadable file formats, and does not sufficiently block file extensions that could be interpreted as PHP code by web servers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can upload a file that is interpreted as PHP code by the webserver and execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated administrator adds a dangerous file extension (e.g., *.phar*) to the allowed file types. Then, any user can upload a file with that extension. If the file is accessed directly via the browser, it's interpreted as PHP code and the code will be executed on the server.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have administrator access to the Concrete5 CMS."
  },
  "details": "The vulnerability exists because Concrete5 blocks certain file extensions like `php`, `php2`, `php3`, `php4`, `php5`, `php7`, `phtml` but not other file extensions that are also interpreted as PHP by web servers (e.g. `phar`, `php8`, `shtml`, `cgi`, `pl`, `phpsh`, `pht`, `.htaccess`). By adding these extensions to allowed file types, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code by accessing the uploaded file via the browser. The Proof of Concept demonstrates how to upload a `shell.phar` file containing PHP code and execute it by using a GET parameter `cmd`."
