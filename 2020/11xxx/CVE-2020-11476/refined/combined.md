# usd-2020-0041 | Concrete5 v8.5.2

**Advisory ID**: usd-2020-0041
**CVE Number**: CVE-2020-11476
**Affected Product**: Concrete5 CMS
**Affected Version**: 8.5.2
**Vulnerability Type**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Security Risk**: High
**Vendor URL**: <https://www.concrete5.org/>
**Vendor Status**: Fixed in 8.5.3

###

###

###

### Description

The web application „concrete5“ is vulnerable to remote code execution. An attacker can define uploadable filetypes in the admin area. The application blocks uploads with file extensions like *php* and *phtml* but not *phar, php8, shtml, cgi, pl, phpsh, pht and .htaccess*.
It is for instance possible for an attacker to upload *phar* files and access them via the browser after some configuration settings in the admin area. This file extension is interpreted as PHP code by many web servers, which allows code execution.

It is possible for an authenticated admin to specify the uploadable file formats in the „Allowed File Types“ section under the URL http://localhost/index.php/dashboard/system/files/filetypes. According to the page, the following file extensions are blocked:

These file extensions will always be blocked: php, php2, php3, php4, php5, php7, phtml

However there are other file formats that are interpreted as PHP by many web servers. One of these file extensions is *.phar*. After adding this file extension, it is possible to upload *.phar* files in the upload section, which are stored on the web server. If an attacker accesses the uploaded file via his browser, this file is interpreted as php and allows code execution.

###

###

###

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

First visit the section „Allowed file types“ under the URL [http://localhost/index.php/dashboard/system/files/filetype](http://localhost/index.php/dashboard/system/files/filetypes). The .*phar* format must be added to the list there.

Create a new file *shell.phar* with the following contents:

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200041.png "usd20200041")

Afterwards visit the following page: <http://localhost/concrete5/index.php/dashboard/files/search>.
On this page it is possible to upload new files and get information about already uploaded files.

Next step is to upload the created file *shell.phar*. After the successful upload of the file it is possible to view the URL of the file. On the same page it is possible to search for the file name *shell.phar* in the file search bar. By right-clicking on the file and selecting „Properties“ you can get the path where the file was saved. The following information would then be displayed:

Filename shell.phar

URL to File http://localhost/application/files/4015/8558/7320/shell.phar

Tracked URL http://localhost/concrete5/index.php/download\_file/21/0

Folder File Manager

The attacker can now visit the received URL and enter system commands in the *cmd* GET parameter which should be executed on the system. The visiting the following URL would execute the system command „whoami“: <http://localhost/application/files/4015/8558/7320/shell.phar?cmd=whoami>

###

### Fix

Although it is possible to add the file extension *.phar* to the *concrete.upload.extensions\_blacklist* this would only be a temporary solution. There are many other file extensions which some web servers interpret as PHP code. It is more difficult to cover all file extensions with a blacklist than to build a whitelist of possible file formats. It would make sense to introduce a *concrete.upload.extensions\_whitelist* which is defined in the code. This way, a user who already has access to the system can modify it. The section „Allowed File Types“ should not allow a user to modify the allowed file formats, it should only display uploadable formats.

# Security Advisories

Um Unternehmen vor Hackern und Kriminellen zu schützen, müssen wir sicherstellen, dass unsere Fähigkeiten und Kenntnisse stets auf dem neuesten Stand sind. Deshalb ist die Sicherheitsforschung für unsere Arbeit ebenso wichtig wie der Aufbau einer Security Community zur Förderung des Wissensaustausches. Denn mehr Sicherheit kann nur erreicht werden, wenn viele sie zu ihrer Aufgabe machen.

Unsere [CST Academy](https://www.usd.de/cst-academy/) und das usd HeroLab sind wesentliche Bestandteile unserer Sicherheitsmission. Das Wissen, das wir in unserer praktischen Arbeit und durch unsere Forschung gewinnen, teilen wir in Schulungen und Publikationen. In diesem Zusammenhang veröffentlicht das usd HeroLab eine Reihe von Beiträgen zu aktuellen Schwachstellen und Sicherheitsproblemen – stets im Einklang mit den Leitsätzen unserer [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/responsible-disclosure/).

Immer im Namen unserer Mission: „more security“.

Hier finden Sie die Security Advisories der vergangenen Monate:

# usd-2020-0041 | Concrete5 v8.5.2

**Advisory ID**: usd-2020-0041
**CVE Number**: CVE-2020-11476
**Affected Product**: Concrete5 CMS
**Affected Version**: 8.5.2
**Vulnerability Type**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Security Risk**: High
**Vendor URL**: <https://www.concrete5.org/>
**Vendor Status**: Fixed in 8.5.3

###

###

###

### Description

The web application „concrete5“ is vulnerable to remote code execution. An attacker can define uploadable filetypes in the admin area. The application blocks uploads with file extensions like *php* and *phtml* but not *phar, php8, shtml, cgi, pl, phpsh, pht and .htaccess*.
It is for instance possible for an attacker to upload *phar* files and access them via the browser after some configuration settings in the admin area. This file extension is interpreted as PHP code by many web servers, which allows code execution.

It is possible for an authenticated admin to specify the uploadable file formats in the „Allowed File Types“ section under the URL http://localhost/index.php/dashboard/system/files/filetypes. According to the page, the following file extensions are blocked:

These file extensions will always be blocked: php, php2, php3, php4, php5, php7, phtml

However there are other file formats that are interpreted as PHP by many web servers. One of these file extensions is *.phar*. After adding this file extension, it is possible to upload *.phar* files in the upload section, which are stored on the web server. If an attacker accesses the uploaded file via his browser, this file is interpreted as php and allows code execution.

###

###

###

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

First visit the section „Allowed file types“ under the URL [http://localhost/index.php/dashboard/system/files/filetype](http://localhost/index.php/dashboard/system/files/filetypes). The .*phar* format must be added to the list there.

Create a new file *shell.phar* with the following contents:

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200041.png "usd20200041")

Afterwards visit the following page: <http://localhost/concrete5/index.php/dashboard/files/search>.
On this page it is possible to upload new files and get information about already uploaded files.

Next step is to upload the created file *shell.phar*. After the successful upload of the file it is possible to view the URL of the file. On the same page it is possible to search for the file name *shell.phar* in the file search bar. By right-clicking on the file and selecting „Properties“ you can get the path where the file was saved. The following information would then be displayed:

Filename shell.phar

URL to File http://localhost/application/files/4015/8558/7320/shell.phar

Tracked URL http://localhost/concrete5/index.php/download\_file/21/0

Folder File Manager

The attacker can now visit the received URL and enter system commands in the *cmd* GET parameter which should be executed on the system. The visiting the following URL would execute the system command „whoami“: <http://localhost/application/files/4015/8558/7320/shell.phar?cmd=whoami>

###

### Fix

Although it is possible to add the file extension *.phar* to the *concrete.upload.extensions\_blacklist* this would only be a temporary solution. There are many other file extensions which some web servers interpret as PHP code. It is more difficult to cover all file extensions with a blacklist than to build a whitelist of possible file formats. It would make sense to introduce a *concrete.upload.extensions\_whitelist* which is defined in the code. This way, a user who already has access to the system can modify it. The section „Allowed File Types“ should not allow a user to modify the allowed file formats, it should only display uploadable formats.
