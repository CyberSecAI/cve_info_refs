  "CVE-2020-11743": {
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in Xen's grant table mapping operation (GNTTABOP_map_grant). Due to misplaced brackets in the code, an error path can return a '1' instead of a negative value, which is incorrect. When a Linux-based dom0 or backend domain attempts to map a grant table entry, the error path returning '1' is misinterpreted as a success, leading to an incorrectly initialized state and subsequently a crash. A buggy or malicious guest OS can manipulate the grant table to trigger this error path.",
    "affected_component": "Xen hypervisor",
    "root_cause": "Misplaced brackets in the error handling code of GNTTABOP_map_grant lead to an incorrect return value.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect return value from GNTTABOP_map_grant in an error condition."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest can cause a denial of service by crashing a Linux-based dom0 or backend domain.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious or buggy guest OS can construct a grant table in a specific way to trigger the incorrect error path during a grant mapping operation from a backend domain.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a guest OS and have the ability to manipulate grant tables.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in systems that have applied the XSA-295 fixes. A patch for Linux is also available to mitigate the issue by making the code more robust to unexpected values."
