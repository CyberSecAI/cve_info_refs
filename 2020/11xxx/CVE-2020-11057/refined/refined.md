Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper verification of dashboard and gadget ownership within the XWiki platform. Specifically, the system was defaulting the owner of gadgets to the system administrator, regardless of who added the gadget to their personal dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce proper access control when adding gadgets to user dashboards. Users without scripting or programming permissions were able to add and execute scripts through the dashboard gadget feature.
*   **Server-Side Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows for the execution of server-side code (Python or Groovy scripts). This is due to the lack of restrictions on the type of code that could be entered into the "Groovy/Python" gadget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running XWiki. This could allow them to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including data exfiltration, system compromise, and denial of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although users do not gain explicit admin privileges through this vulnerability, the ability to execute server-side code can effectively grant them escalated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Dashboard Manipulation:** The attack vector involves a registered user navigating to their personal dashboard.
*   **Gadget Addition:** The attacker adds a "Groovy/Python" gadget to the dashboard.
*   **Script Injection:** The attacker inserts malicious Python or Groovy code into the gadget's content field.
*   **Execution:** Upon submitting the gadget, the injected code is executed on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the XWiki platform.
*   **No Programming Rights Required:** The attacker does not need specific scripting or programming permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the XWiki instance.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in XWiki versions 7.2 up to 11.10.2.
*   The issue was fixed in versions 11.3.7, 11.10.3, and 12.0.
*   A workaround is to remove the `xwiki-platform-dashboard-macro.jar` file, but upgrading is recommended.
*   The provided HTTP POST request example demonstrates how an attacker can add a gadget with malicious code via a direct request.

This information provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability, including its root cause, the weaknesses present, its impact, how it can be exploited, and the necessary capabilities of an attacker.
