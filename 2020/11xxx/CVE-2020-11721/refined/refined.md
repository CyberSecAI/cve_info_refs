The provided content is related to CVE-2020-11721.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing initialization of the `rows` pointer in the `load_png` function within the `loader.c` file. Specifically, the `rows` pointer is not explicitly set to `NULL` before the cleanup code is executed. If the `load_png` function fails before allocating memory for `rows`, the cleanup code would attempt to `free()` the uninitialized pointer, leading to a double free or invalid free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of uninitialized pointer
- Invalid free operation

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The program crashes due to the attempt to free an invalid memory location.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted PNG file as input to the `img2sixel` binary, specifically one that causes the `load_png` to fail before allocating memory for `rows`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PNG file to the vulnerable binary (`img2sixel`). This likely means local or network access to the program.
