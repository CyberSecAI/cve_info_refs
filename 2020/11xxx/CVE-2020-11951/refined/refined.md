Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a hard-coded root backdoor account present on both PDU and CMC III devices. This account has an identical password hash across multiple Rittal devices.
*   The password hash is stored using a weak MD5 hashing algorithm.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded credentials:** The existence of a root user account with a pre-set password hash creates a significant security flaw.
*   **Weak Password Storage:** Use of the MD5 algorithm is considered insecure for password hashing, making it easier to crack.
*  **Cross-device password:** The same root password hash being used across devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who knows or cracks the root password gains full control over affected Rittal devices with the highest possible user privileges. This could result in complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves obtaining the hardcoded root password hash which allows direct login to the device with root privileges.
* An attacker who has already gained access to one Rittal device could use the same root credentials to gain root access on other devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know or be able to crack the root password for the hard-coded account.
*  No other information or special access seems to be necessary to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker would need to have network access to the device to use the credentials to log in.

**Additional Details:**

* The advisory notes that the root user including the password is not documented publicly.
* The vendor claims that the root account cannot be exploited/used, but the advisory suggests it's a significant issue if the password hash is known.
* A fix for the weak password storage is available in firmware versions V\_.15.70 or higher, but requires that users change their passwords to update the algorithm.

This vulnerability is related to CVE-2020-11951 because the report explicitly states  "Hard-Coded Root Backdoor Account (CVE-2020-11951) & Weak Password Storage Algorithm".
