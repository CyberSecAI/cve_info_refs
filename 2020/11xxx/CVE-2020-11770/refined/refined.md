The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a post-authentication command injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory does not specify the root cause, only that a post-authentication command injection exists.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Post-authentication command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory notes the CVSS v3 score of 8.0 which is high with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which translates to:
  - Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent Network
  - Attack Complexity (AC): Low
  - Privileges Required (PR): Low
  - User Interaction (UI): None
  - Scope (S): Unchanged
  - Confidentiality (C): High
  - Integrity (I): High
  - Availability (A): High
- This implies a successful exploit would lead to complete compromise including confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Adjacent Network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network and have valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability (post-authentication).
