# CWE-93 CRLF injection in httplib2

Low

[temoto](/temoto)
published
GHSA-gg84-qgv9-w4pq
May 20, 2020

## Package

httplib2

## Affected versions

< 0.18.0

## Patched versions

0.18.0

## Description

### Impact

Attacker controlling unescaped part of uri for `httplib2.Http.request()` could change request headers and body, send additional hidden requests to same server.

Impacts software that uses httplib2 with uri constructed by string concatenation, as opposed to proper urllib building with escaping.

### Patches

Problem has been fixed in 0.18.0

Space, CR, LF characters are now quoted before any use.

This solution should not impact any valid usage of httplib2 library, that is uri constructed by urllib.

### Workarounds

Create URI with `urllib.parse` family functions: `urlencode`, `urlunsplit`.

```
user_input = " HTTP/1.1\r\ninjected: attack\r\nignore-http:"
-uri = "https://api.server/?q={}".format(user_input)
+uri = urllib.parse.urlunsplit(("https", "api.server", "/v1", urllib.parse.urlencode({"q": user_input}), ""))
http.request(uri)
```

Package        : python-httplib2
Version        : 0.9+dfsg-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-11078

In httplib2, an attacker controlling unescaped part of uri for
`httplib2.Http.request()` could change request headers and body, send
additional hidden requests to same server. This vulnerability impacts
software that uses httplib2 with uri constructed by string
concatenation, as opposed to proper urllib building with escaping.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.9+dfsg-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-httplib2 packages.
