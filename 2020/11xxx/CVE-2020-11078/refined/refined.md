Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11078:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the URI within the `httplib2.Http.request()` function. Specifically, the library didn't encode or escape special characters like spaces, carriage returns (`\r`), and line feeds (`\n`) within the URI. This allowed attackers to inject these characters into the URI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CRLF Injection (CWE-93):** By injecting carriage return (`\r`) and line feed (`\n`) characters, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request. This is due to the way HTTP headers are delimited.
- **Space Injection (CWE-75):** Injecting a space could allow manipulation of the request URI, which could potentially lead to other issues or vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Header injection:** An attacker can manipulate the request by injecting arbitrary HTTP headers. This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    - **Session hijacking:** By injecting headers related to session cookies, an attacker could potentially hijack user sessions.
    - **Response manipulation:** By injecting headers that influence how the server responds, an attacker could trick the client.
    - **Bypass security mechanisms:** Certain security mechanisms rely on headers, and by manipulating them, an attacker could bypass them.
- **Request smuggling:**  An attacker can inject a new request after the original request, which can lead to further vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a URI constructed using string concatenation that includes unescaped user-controlled input.
- The attacker needs to control a portion of the URI that is passed to `httplib2.Http.request()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the construction of the URI. This is typically done in cases where user input is directly included in the URI string without any sanitization.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges, other than the ability to get the application to make an HTTP request using a crafted URI.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix involves forcing `%xx` quoting of space, CR, and LF characters in the URI before sending the request.
- The advisory suggests that users should construct their URIs with the `urllib.parse` functions instead of string concatenation.
- The vulnerability affects versions prior to `0.18.0` of the `httplib2` library.
- The provided test cases show how an attacker can inject spaces and CRLF characters, and how this is mitigated in the patched versions.
- The severity is considered "low" by GitHub. However, it's important to understand the context of the application using the library, as the impact can vary from low to high depending on the use case.
