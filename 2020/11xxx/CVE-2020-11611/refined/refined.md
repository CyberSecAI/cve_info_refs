Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11611:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `xdLocalStorage` library's client-side component (`xdLocalStorage.js`) using a wildcard (`*`) for the `targetOrigin` when sending messages via `postMessage()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Wildcard targetOrigin in `buildMessage()`:** The `buildMessage()` function in `xdLocalStorage.js` sends messages to the iframe using `iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify(data), '*')`. The wildcard `*` allows any origin within the iframe to receive the messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can redirect the "magical iframe" to a domain they control.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can receive messages sent from the client to the iframe containing sensitive information. They can also send messages back to the client with a valid `requestId`, potentially leading to further security issues based on how the client processes this information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Redirection of the iframe:** An attacker would need to redirect the "magical iframe" loaded within the vulnerable application to a domain they control. This could be done through various means such as:
    - Vulnerabilities within the "magical iframe" page.
    - Compromising a service or the network used to serve this page.
    - Social engineering of the user

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to control a domain that can be loaded within the iframe.
- Ability to induce a user to visit the attacker controlled domain.
- Ability to inject code into the "magical iframe", or otherwise redirect the iframe to the attacker-controlled site.

**Additional details:**

- The provided content contains a detailed explanation of the vulnerabilities within the `xdLocalStorage` library, including a proof-of-concept exploit. The `xdLocalStorage` library uses a "magical iframe" to facilitate cross-domain storage using `postMessage`.
- The article describes other related vulnerabilities within the library such as missing origin validation on the client side (`xdLocalStorage.js`) and the "magical iframe" side (`xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js`) when receiving messages, which are covered by CVE-2015-9544 and CVE-2015-9545 respectively.
- The related vulnerability CVE-2020-11610 stems from the `postData()` function in `xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js` specifying the wildcard (`*`) as the `targetOrigin` when calling the `postMessage()` function on the `parent` object.

The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including code examples, a step-by-step explanation of the vulnerability, and a proof-of-concept exploit.
