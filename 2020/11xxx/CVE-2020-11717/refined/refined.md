Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11717:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of unprepared SQL statements in "Programi Bilanc," leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist within the application.
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can be triggered when searching for products or services with modified content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries which could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- Successful SQL injection attacks may lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the database server.
- XSS vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves manipulating input fields (e.g. when searching for products or services) to inject SQL code.
- XSS can be triggered by inserting malicious scripts within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to interact with the application through its user interface (e.g. the search function for products or services) or other input points exposed to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- No specific network position is mentioned, suggesting that a standard user with network access to the application could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects "Programi Bilanc" - Build 007 Release 014 31.01.2020 and probably below
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 01-APR-2020, and public disclosure occurred on 17-DEC-2020 after a 90-day period.
