Without this change, we only set a flag when a certificate error occurred.
However, when the same certificate error then happens a second time (e.g.
because of a reload or opening the same URL again), we then colored the URL as
success_https (i.e. green) again.

See [#5403](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403)

Security: Remember hosts with ignored cert errors for load status

```
Without this change, we only set a flag when a certificate error occurred.
However, when the same certificate error then happens a second time (e.g.
because of a reload or opening the same URL again), we then colored the URL as
success_https (i.e. green) again.

See [#5403](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403)

Security: Remember hosts with ignored cert errors for load status

Without this change, we only set a flag when a certificate error occurred.
However, when the same certificate error then happens a second time (e.g.
because of a reload or opening the same URL again), we then colored the URL as
success_https (i.e. green) again.

See [#5403](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403)

Security: Remember hosts with ignored cert errors for load status

```
Without this change, we only set a flag when a certificate error occurred.
However, when the same certificate error then happens a second time (e.g.
because of a reload or opening the same URL again), we then colored the URL as
success_https (i.e. green) again.

See [#5403](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403)

|  |  | - After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays |
|  |  | the URL as yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`). However, when the |
|  |  | affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly |
|  |  | displayed as green (`colors.statusbar.url.success\_https`). While the user |
|  |  | already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set |
|  |  | `content.ssl\_strict` to `false` which is not recommended), this could still |
|  |  | provide a false sense of security. This is now fixed. |

Security: Remember hosts with ignored cert errors for load status

```
Without this change, we only set a flag when a certificate error occurred.
However, when the same certificate error then happens a second time (e.g.
because of a reload or opening the same URL again), we then colored the URL as
success_https (i.e. green) again.

See [#5403](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403)

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-f0812d6aad
2020-09-21 00:00:35.262153
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : qutebrowser
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 1.13.1
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <http://www.qutebrowser.org>
Summary : A keyboard-driven, vim-like browser based on PyQt5 and QtWebEngine
Description :
qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It���s based on
Python, PyQt5 and QtWebEngine and free software, licensed under the GPL.
It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

We missed a few upstream releases but there's not breaking changes as far as I
know. Lot of bug fixes and minor changes. ---- Addresses CVE-2020-11054: After
a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as
yellow (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website was
subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green
(colors.statusbar.url.success\_https). While the user already has seen a
certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl\_strict to false which
is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security. This is
now fixed.

Security: Remember hosts with ignored cert errors for load status

```
Without this change, we only set a flag when a certificate error occurred.
However, when the same certificate error then happens a second time (e.g.
because of a reload or opening the same URL again), we then colored the URL as
success_https (i.e. green) again.

See [#5403](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403)

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-fcd5fd47bd
2020-09-13 14:17:24.303303
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : qutebrowser
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.11.1
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.qutebrowser.org>
Summary : A keyboard-driven, vim-like browser based on PyQt5 and QtWebEngine
Description :
qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It���s based on
Python, PyQt5 and QtWebEngine and free software, licensed under the GPL.
It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Addresses CVE-2020-11054: After a certificate error was overridden by the user,
qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However,
when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly
displayed as green (colors.statusbar.url.success\_https). While the user already
has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl\_strict to
false which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of
security. This is now fixed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Sat May 23 2020 Timoth��e Floure fnux@fedoraproject.org - 1.11.1-1
- New upstream release (addresses CVE-2020-11054)
\* Fri May 1 2020 Timoth��e Floure fnux@fedoraproject.org - 1.11.0-1

## Package

qutebrowser
(PyPI)

## Affected versions

< 1.11.1

## Patched versions

1.11.1

## Description

# Description

After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`). However, when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green (`colors.statusbar.url.success_https`). While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set `content.ssl_strict` to `false` which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security.

# Affected versions and patches

The issue is fixed in qutebrowser v1.11.1 (pending release) and v1.12.0 (unreleased). Backported patches for older versions are available, but no further releases are planned:

## Description

![@The-Compiler](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625793?u=e7536338cfb5f42fbca34ce43c4304693ada7112&v=4&size=48)[The-Compiler](https://github.com/The-Compiler)opened [on May 2, 2020](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403#issue-611198849)

While working on [46b4d26](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/46b4d26a9ca1aba24a00ccd004606c8e3a6b17d4) I noticed that only the first load of pages with certificate errors gets a correctly colored URL.

When loading a page with the default `content.ssl_strict = ask` setting, there's a prompt to confirm the certificate issue:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625793/80866425-de3ce980-8c8e-11ea-9ee6-2e1a5cf51695.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625793/80866425-de3ce980-8c8e-11ea-9ee6-2e1a5cf51695.png)

When answering that with "yes", the URL is then colored yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`) rather than green (`colors.statusbar.url.success_https.fg`):

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625793/80866447-fca2e500-8c8e-11ea-959d-840a030f47ac.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625793/80866447-fca2e500-8c8e-11ea-959d-840a030f47ac.png)

However, when reloading the page (or loading it again in another tab), the URL is green:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625793/80866461-0debf180-8c8f-11ea-818b-d21813449c45.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625793/80866461-0debf180-8c8f-11ea-818b-d21813449c45.png)

This is because QtWebEngine remembers the answer internally and we don't get a `certificateErrors` signal anymore - unfortunately there's also no API to check the certificate state of the current page...

I'm handling this as a low-severity security vulnerability and will request a CVE. There's no way for bad actors to exploit this and the user already did override the certificate error (so should be aware that the connection is not to be trusted), but it still lures users into a false sense of security.

A fix, release and security announcement is in progress.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c0)  Florian Bruhin    2020-05-02 14:20:36 UTC  ``` When opening <https://expired.badssl.com/> and granting a certificate exception, the site info panel (when clicking the site's favicon) claims "Your connection to this site is *secured*" despite that not being the case.  When loading the site again in a new tab (or even just reloading it), QtWebEngine remembers the certificate exemption and doesn't ask again - those two things combined might provide users with a false sense of security that a connection is secure, despite that not being the case.  I noticed this while fixing a similar issue in qutebrowser: <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403>  While I consider this a security-relevant bug (and will request a CVE for qutebrowser), there's nothing to be exploited by a bad actor, hence I'm opening this publicly.  This is on Archlinux, with Qt 5.14.2 and Falkon 3.1.0. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c1)  Florian Bruhin    2020-05-02 16:37:54 UTC  ``` I've looked at how other projects using QtWebEngine handle this case. The only approaches I have found are:  - Open a second connection via QSslSocket to check the certificate:    <https://github.com/vicr123/theweb/commit/5f6cbc6093a1adb4fdf3db829b182139e065319b>  - Save a set of insecure hosts in the certificateError signals, and assume    those are always insecure until a restart, from Viper Browser:   <https://github.com/LeFroid/Viper-Browser/blob/master/src/core/network/SecurityManager.cpp>  I decided to go for the latter with qutebrowser - I already did set a flag in this situation so the UI was correct for the first load, but not for subsequent loads.  The preliminary qutebrowser fix (currently waiting for CI) is here:  <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/c7a0a150b2e991cc1c2fe8b883b074a800c2c40e> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c2)  David Rosca    2020-05-03 09:35:19 UTC  ``` Well, this is not really a 100% fix, because QtNetwork and QtWebEngine (Chromium) uses different SSL stacks, so you can still show false positives/negatives.  And as there is no way to query this information from QtWebEngine, there is no correct fix. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c3)  Florian Bruhin    2020-05-04 09:24:48 UTC  ``` Agreed that there isn't a proper, clean fix for this. Still, remembering insecure hostnames and always treating them as insecure seems like an acceptable workaround: While still showing "insecure" when the problem is fixed server-side is unfortunate, it's still much better than showing "secure" when the connection isn't.  FWIW I added a comment here: <https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-80860?focusedCommentId=510104&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-510104> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c4)  TW3    2020-06-16 23:25:25 UTC  ``` <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-overview.html#managing-certificates> Appears to be relevant here.  Forgive me if I've missed something but isn't one way to solve this issue, to check the page's error enumeration <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwebenginecertificateerror.html#Error-enum> and update the padlock icon (in the address bar) along with the site information pop ups to reflect the fact that the connection is insecure? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c5)  Florian Bruhin    2020-06-24 14:54:09 UTC  ``` TW3: No, because there's no way to ask "does the current page have a certificate error" - there's only the QWebEnginePage::certificateError signal which doesn't get emitted anymore after an exception was granted. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c6)  TW3    2020-06-30 20:18:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Florian Bruhin from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c5)) > TW3: No, because there's no way to ask "does the current page... Exceptions are granted upon the domain not the page.  It's a simple choice between maintaining a temporary or permanent, per-domain list of exceptions once a user chooses to ignore the cert error. The QWebEnginePage::certificateError signal could be used to double check the error type before the exception is created. It may simply be OK to put an exception list check behind a bool which becomes true the very first time the very first exception is granted or always if there is a permanent list.  Encouraging users to just grant cert exceptions for sites actually defeats the purpose of ssl and should be very heavily discouraged. Thus there should be no issues with incurring a small performance penalty for doing so IMO.  Using a valid cert for https is very important. Various reasons for doing so exist and Google explain it quite well here: <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en>  Another way to solve the issue mentioned here is to prevent all exceptions. I'm not advocating to do that but the issue should be dealt with, with absolutely minimal work. Spending time supporting http without encryption is fairy counter intuitive at this point in time.  Thanks. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c7)  Florian Bruhin    2020-06-30 20:27:02 UTC  ``` > It's a simple choice between maintaining a temporary or permanent, per-domain list of exceptions once a user chooses to ignore the cert error.  Which is what I already proposed in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c1) above. The problem with that is that it will still mark the connection as insecure even after the certificate has been fixed. But we're going in circles here, that's all already explained in the comments above. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=420902#c8)  TW3    2020-07-11 23:51:20 UTC  ``` > But we're going in circles here, that's all already explained in the comments above.  Speak for yourself. I fixed this in my tree a week ago including updating the address bar icons and the site info widget. And if you still think:  > TW3: No, because there's no way to ask "does the current page have a certificate error"  I urge you to please go and actually look at the source code which is causing this issue.

Security: Remember hosts with ignored cert errors for load status

```
Without this change, we only set a flag when a certificate error occurred.
However, when the same certificate error then happens a second time (e.g.
because of a reload or opening the same URL again), we then colored the URL as
success_https (i.e. green) again.

See [#5403](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403)
