Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11054:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-11054. The core issue described is that qutebrowser does not correctly remember hosts for which certificate errors have been ignored. This can lead to the browser falsely indicating a secure connection after the initial exception has been granted. All the provided content, including the github commits, bugzilla entries, mailing list discussions, and the github security advisory directly relate to this vulnerability.

**2. Extracted information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is that qutebrowser only sets a flag when a certificate error occurs initially. When the same error occurs a second time (e.g., due to a reload or opening the same URL again), the browser does not re-evaluate the certificate error, thus incorrectly displaying the URL with a "success_https" status (green color).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper handling of previously ignored SSL certificate errors.
    *   The browser fails to persistently remember hosts with ignored certificate errors.
    *   Incorrect UI indication (green URL) after a user has explicitly ignored a certificate error.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Users may develop a false sense of security about a connection that is known to be insecure.
    *   Users might be less vigilant about security warnings on subsequent visits/reloads to the same site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a website with a certificate error and chooses to ignore it, then revisits that same site.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No specific attacker capabilities or position are required to trigger this vulnerability. The issue is inherent in the browser's behavior and is triggered by normal user interaction. The user must, however, choose to ignore the certificate error initially.

**3. Additional details from the content:**

*   **Specific code changes:**  The provided GitHub commit logs show code changes to address this vulnerability. These include adding a set to store insecure hosts, and modifications to the `_update_load_status` function to check the `_insecure_hosts` set and display a "warn" status. The files modified include:
    *   `qutebrowser/browser/browsertab.py`
    *   `qutebrowser/browser/webengine/webenginetab.py`
    *   `qutebrowser/browser/webkit/webkittab.py`
*   **Timeline:**
    *   The vulnerability was discovered on May 2, 2020.
    *   CVE assigned by GitHub on May 6, 2020.
    *   Fix released in qutebrowser v1.11.1 on May 7, 2020.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Treat any host with a certificate exception as insecure, regardless of the URL color.
    *   Set the `content.ssl_strict` setting to `True` to prevent certificate exceptions altogether.
*   **Related issues:**
    *   Similar issues were identified in KDE Falkon and eric6 Web Browser.
    *   Links to the relevant issue trackers were provided in the GitHub security advisory and qutebrowser issue.
*   **Affected Versions**: All versions of qutebrowser before 1.11.1 are affected.

In summary, CVE-2020-11054 is a low severity vulnerability related to how qutebrowser handles certificate exceptions. The browser fails to remember previously ignored hosts and incorrectly indicates a secure connection on subsequent loads, potentially creating a false sense of security. The fix involves remembering insecure hosts and using that information to correctly indicate the load status.
