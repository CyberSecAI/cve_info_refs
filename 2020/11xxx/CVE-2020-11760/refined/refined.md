Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11760:

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read within the `rleUncompress` function in `ImfRle.cpp` when processing Run-Length Encoded (RLE) compressed data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Out-of-bounds read

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors**:
- Processing a maliciously crafted image file containing a specially crafted RLE stream.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted OpenEXR image file to the vulnerable application.
- No specific attacker position/capabilities are mentioned other than providing the crafted file. It is implied that the attacker can reach the vulnerable code through a normal file processing path.

**Additional notes**:
- This vulnerability affects multiple platforms, including Apple's macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and iCloud for Windows, as well as Linux distributions using the vulnerable OpenEXR library.
- The vulnerability exists within the OpenEXR library itself, specifically in the code that handles RLE decompression.
- The fix for this vulnerability is implemented through improved bounds checking.
- The vulnerability is present in OpenEXR versions prior to 2.4.1
- The vulnerability could lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- Exploitation can occur through local or remote attack vectors, depending on how the application processes the malicious input.
-  Multiple buffer overflow issues exist in openEXR, and they were addressed with improved checks.
