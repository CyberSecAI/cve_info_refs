[Audacity 3.6.0](/audacity/audacity/releases/tag/Audacity-3.6.0)

## Major changes

* Master effects

  Audacity now features master effects. Master effects are effects which apply to the entire project at once. More information can be found at [Using master effects & realtime effects](https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects).
* New compressor and limiter

  A new compressor and limiter has been added, replacing the previous versions. A gain reduction history has been added to these effects when they're used as a [realtime effect](https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects).

  Factory Presets suitable for a wide range of use cases for these effects have been provided by Vladislav Isaev and Marek Iwaszkiewicz, available via the Presets & Settings button.
* New themes

  Audacity now features new and improved dark and light themes. You can switch between themes via Preferences -> Interface. The theme previously used still is around as the Classic theme, and themes even older than that can be optionally [installed as custom themes](https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/customizing-audacity/using-themes#installing-custom-themes) from [here](https://github.com/LWinterberg/classicTheme).

  Updated instructions on creating custom themes can be found [here](https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/scripting/creating-custom-themes).
* Increased performance

  Audacity is now quite a bit snappier than before, especially when working on larger projects and on larger screens.

## Other changes

* Added FFmpeg 7 support.
* You now can paste audio files into Audacity using Ctrl+V.
* Alternative waveform colors are now themeable by custom themes.
* Removed the track name overlay preference and the "blend themes" preference.
* Scripting: Added GetInfo: Type=Selection. (Thanks, Jonat√£ Bolzan Loss!)
* Added an Extras > Export > Export Selected Audio option.
* Import Raw: Added support for offsets larger than 2 GB.
* Redesigned the "what's new" dialog.
* Added an option to the View menu to show/hide RMS in waveforms.
* OpenVINO AI effects can now be downloaded from [audacityteam.org/download/openvino/](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/openvino/)

### Bugfixes

* [#6340](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/6340) When recording to a new track, the track is now scrolled back into view again.
* [#3825](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/3825) The macro manager no longer shows parameterless actions as editable. (Thanks, Davi Nonnenmacher!)
* [#6138](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/6138) Pressing Esc in some preference dialogs no longer saves them.
* [#4504](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/4504) Fixed stray orange lines in the high contrast theme.
* [#5626](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5626) Fixed the quality slider for Ogg export on Linux. (Thanks, Devpriya Nalin!)
* [#6875](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/6875) Fixed a bug which could open a project with the wrong sample rate.
* Various compiler warning fixes and OpenBSD build fixes. (Thanks, Brad Smith!)

[Audacity 3.5.0](/audacity/audacity/releases/tag/Audacity-3.5.0)

Audacity 3.5 adds cloud saving, beat detection, pitch shifting and more.

## Major changes

* Cloud project saving

  We've introduced a new cloud-saving feature that allows you to save your Audacity projects to audio.com. This allows you to work from any device, share & collaborate with others and restore previous versions if something went wrong.
* Automatic tempo detection

  Audacity can now automatically detect the tempo of imported loops, and adjust them to be in tempo.

  Tempo detection is done via both audio analysis and metadata checking. If you want to prepare your loop for automatic tempo detection without relying on audio analysis, both acidizer tempo tags or simply writing "123 bpm" anywhere into the filename work.

  Automatic tempo detection can be turned off via Preferences -> Import/Export.
* Pitch shifting

  You now can non-destructively change the pitch of a clip by holding Alt and pressing the Up and Down arrow keys. Alternatively, you can click on the overflow menu (...) and select "Pitch and speed...". When changing the pitch this way, an arrow in the UI indicates how much you've shifted it.

## Other changes

### Additions

* Added an option to skip plugin scanning to Preferences -> Effects.
* Added an overflow menu, as well as speed and pitch indicators to clips.
* Added subtitle formats for labels. Export to WebVTT and SubRip and import of SubRip files is now supported. (Thanks, Pokechu22 and Larry Bordowitz!)

### Changes

* Reworked the plugin manager.
* Improved accessibility. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
* When zooming in vertically (Ctrl+scroll on the vertical scale), the zeroline now remains centered. Moving the vertical zoom off-center still is possible via Shift+scroll on the vertical scale.
* Changed the look of the selection adjust cursors (previously pointing fingers on Windows and macOS, now look like >| everywhere).
* Changed the timeline options button from a green triangle to a settings gear. From it, you can switch between Beats & Measures or hh:mm:ss timeline rulers, set various preferences regarding to looping, as well as playhead behaviors: "Scroll view to playhead" (previously: "Update display while playing") and "Continuous scrolling" (previously: Pinned Play Head).
* Improved BSD support. (Thanks, Brad Smith!)
* macOS: Changed the Audacity.app icon on macOS to fit new design guidelines.
* Reordered some menus.
* Moved OK/Cancel buttons of effects to the bottom.

### Removals

There have been a number of removals of niche features to simplify the app. This should make the app a bit less overwhelming to use, and also will speed up future development as fewer things need to be considered.

* Removed the read-only mouse preferences page.
* Removed Printing options.
* Removed Screenshot tool. To make a screenshot, use Win+Shift+S (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+4 (Mac) instead.
* Removed Karaoke view.
* Removed the "solo=none" preference.
* Removed timeline tooltips preference.
* Removed "dragging selection edges" preference.
* Removed some warning dialogs and associated preferences.
* Removed "scrolling left of zero" preference.
* Replaced "Advanced Vertical Zooming" with new always-on behavior.
* Removed some vertical zoom presets.
* Removed EQ XML to TXT converter, which was needed for the Audacity 2.3 -> 2.4 transition. It is now a plugin instead, downloadable at <https://plugins.audacityteam.org/additional-resources/eq-curves/eq-xml-to-txt-converter>.
* Removed the "Vocal reduction and isolation" effect. As a replacement on Windows and Linux, the Intel OpenVINO plugins work better and on a wider array of content, including mono tracks. The old effect still can be downloaded from <https://plugins.audacityteam.org/nyquist-plugins/effect-plugins/filters-and-eq#vocal-reduction-and-isolation>

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a number of dialogs that were able to grow too large to fit on the screen.
* [#2133](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/2133) Fixed the playback cursor sometimes desynchronizing with actual playback. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
* [#3723](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/3723) [#5615](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5615) Fixed the GetInfo scripting command.
* [#5283](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5283) Fixed "Reset configuration" command breaking modules preference page.
* [#5389](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5389) Fixed stereo tracks randomly splitting into mono.
* [#5500](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5500) The Export Audio -> (external program) option remembers the command line argument again.
* [#5670](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5670) [#3903](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/3903) Fixed the Compressor effect sometimes corrupting audio. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
* [#5580](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5580) [#4952](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/4952) Fixed Timer Record sometimes failing to export. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
* [#5681](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/5681) Fixed incorrect level measurements for mono tracks in Noise Gate effect. (Thanks, Steve Daulton!)
* [#5750](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5750) When exporting multiple files, the mono/stereo setting is now honored properly.
* [#5848](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5848) Fixed some effects failing when language is set to German, Korean, Dutch, Slovenian, or Turkish.
* [#5868](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5868) [#1548](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1548) Fixed 8 and 9 inputs not working on keyboard inputs which have AltGr+8/9 mean [ and ]. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
* [#5858](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/5858) Fixed Audacity crashing when making a stereo track using keyboard. (Thanks, Joe Souza!)
* [#5976](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/5976) Fixed the "Set default" button not working in the metadata editor. (Thanks, dg-no-9!)
* [#5977](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/5977) Linux: Fixed a memory leak in Wayland by explicitly running on X11. (Thanks, Takahashi, Naoki!)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1807893#c0)  Petr Viktorin (pviktori)    2020-02-27 12:46:01 UTC  ``` Python 2 reached upstream end-of-life in January 2020. In Fedora Rawhide, it's now provided from the compat package `python27`. Packages that only use Python 2 at build time, like audacity, had a general exception to keep using it in Fedora 31. Now, the dependency should be removed.  It seems that Python 3 support was already merged upstream, at least for the bundled lv2 library which is the thing that fails when I replace "BuildRequires: python2" with "BuildRequires: /usr/bin/python". See: <https://github.com/audacity/audacity/commit/be336797b3a7a921174165524c15141c647b681b>  If it's possible that the Python 2 build dependency won't get removed in Fedora 33, please let us know; the package will need a FESCo exception.  If you need anything from us, or something is unclear, please mention it here.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1807893#c1)  Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client    2020-04-06 16:47:09 UTC  ``` This package has changed maintainer in the Fedora. Reassigning to the new maintainer of this component.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1807893#c2)  Ian McInerney    2020-04-07 13:07:28 UTC  ``` I am waiting for the upcoming 2.4 release before removing the build requires. That commit touches a large portion of code, so I don't feel comfortable cherry-picking into our package. Upstream is hoping to release 2.4 in May, so that should give plenty of time before the F33 branch/mass rebuild.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1807893#c3)  Ben Cotton    2020-08-11 13:10:52 UTC  ``` This bug appears to have been reported against 'rawhide' during the Fedora 33 development cycle. Changing version to 33.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1807893#c4)  Fedora Update System    2021-02-09 23:49:03 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-fd5673905c has been submitted as an update to Fedora 33. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-fd5673905c>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1807893#c5)  Fedora Update System    2021-02-10 00:44:40 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-fd5673905c has been pushed to the Fedora 33 testing repository.

I'm not sure as to why it can't detect FFmpeg, it seems to be looking for "libavformat.so.55" which isn't available anywhere.

Thanks for those. [Bug 1798987](show_bug.cgi?id=1798987 "CLOSED ERRATA - Display no longer updated (waveform not redrawn, cursor missing etc.)") (what the patch originally points to) in particular implies to me more guilt by association than an actual Wayland issue. The original reporters all mention it happens with both X11 and Wayland sessions. Forcing the GDK backend might "fix" it, but the issue likely lies elsewhere (probably GTK3, as noted in upstream 459[0]). I'm not saying that part of the patch shouldn't be reinstated, but I cannot reproduce the issue with 2.4.2, they even mention in 459 it may be fixed in 2.4.2[1]. If we don't reevaluate patches, they tend to get carried on forever. The rest of that patch explicitly adds some supported types (mpeg / mp3 which seem to be correctly listed now, and MIDI which does not seem to actually work for me, Audacity opens it correctly, but cannot play, possible bug?), and a fix for Fedora Studio (which no longer exists, is it somehow required by Fedora Jam?).  Either way, if the GDK backend part of the patch is reinstated, an explicit requires of "xorg-x11-server-Xwayland" should probably be added.

Even though I can't get MIDI playback to actually produce sound, opening a long, complicated MIDI (I downloaded an almost certainly inappropriate to link here for copyright reasons Bohemian Rhapsody MIDI file) and pressing play will produce the issue described in [bug 1798987](show_bug.cgi?id=1798987 "CLOSED ERRATA - Display no longer updated (waveform not redrawn, cursor missing etc.)") every time. Interesting that my big WAV projects do not produce the issue.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1836497#c25)  Brandon Nielsen    2021-02-11 00:09:15 UTC  ``` It is not finding system lv2 or portmidi, the latter may be the reason why MIDI playback does not work. I have not tested runtime detection of lv2.  It also is not detecting system LAME, runtime detection seems to work so until that's fixed an explicit requires on LAME should be added.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1836497#c26)  Fedora Update System    2021-02-11 01:59:55 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-dadbd49ece has been pushed to the Fedora 33 testing repository.

# The Many Perils of /tmp

November 29, 2020

You may not know this, but creating and using files in `/tmp` is dangerous[1](#easy-footnote-bottom-1-758 "It‚Äôs not just <code>/tmp</code> you need to be concerned about. Improper usage of other directories, such as <code>/var/tmp</code>, <code>/dev/shm</code>, and <code>/var/run</code>, can lead to security vulnerabilities.").‚Äú Why?‚Äù you ask. Well, `/tmp` is world readable and world writable, meaning that **any** user on the system may read or write to it. Therefore, when an application creates files in `/tmp`, it must take special care to create those files with safe, restrictive permissions and unpredictable names.

Vulnerabilities resulting from the insecure use of `/tmp` are surprisingly common. In this post, I‚Äôll discuss three security vulnerabilities that I discovered with the help of [TmpWatcher](https://salvatoresecurity.com/spotting-tmp-related-vulnerabilities-with-tmpwatcher/). These vulnerabilities exemplify some of the ways that files in `/tmp` can be abused.

## DoS in Zim ([CVE-2020-10870](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10870))

[Zim](https://zim-wiki.org/) is a graphical editor for wiki pages. When Zim starts, it creates a directory at `/tmp/zim-<USERNAME>` with `0700` permissions if the directory does not already exist. While the directory‚Äôs permissions are sufficiently restrictive, the predictability of the directory‚Äôs name can allow a malicious user to cause a denial of service. If Zim is unable to create or access the temporary directory when it starts, it will crash.

If a user‚Äôs `/tmp/zim-<USERNAME>` directory does not already exist (files in `/tmp` are often cleaned up upon reboot), a malicious user can anticipate the names of Zim‚Äôs temporary directories and create them with `0700` permissions before other users start Zim. When Zim attempts to start, it will be unable to read or write to the preexisting temporary directory, as this directory is owned by the malicious user. In other words, any user on the system can prevent all other users from using Zim.

The simplest [solution](https://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki/pull/1029) to this vulnerability is that Zim should create its temporary directories with random, unpredictable names. In this way, a malicious user cannot predict the directories‚Äô names and cannot create the directories in advance. [A better solution](https://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki/commit/2d30fd7cc857c179557b3e3de93e09534a8766c2), however, is for Zim to not use `/tmp` at all. Instead, it could use a directory that is not world writable, such as [$XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html#variables).

## Information Disclosure in Audacity [2](#easy-footnote-bottom-2-758 "The Audacity development team was notified of this vulnerability privately on March 10, 2020. As of November 28, 2020, they&#8217;ve not notified me of any plans to resolve the issue.") ([CVE-2020-11867](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11867))

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is an open source, multitrack audio editor and recorder. On the surface, it might appear that Audacity has the same issue as Zim. Audacity creates a directory with a predictable name at `/var/tmp/audacity-<USERNAME>`. Unlike Zim, however, if Audacity is unable to write to this temporary directory, it prompts the user to select a new location for its temporary files. In this way, Audacity mitigates the risk of a DoS. Audacity uses these temporary files for recovery in the event of a crash. Therefore, this temporary directory must have a predictable name so that Audacity can find it.

When Audacity is used to record audio, it stores `*.au` files in its temporary directory. Unfortunately, the permissions on this directory are not adequately restricted. `/var/tmp/audacity-<USERNAME>` is created with `0777` permissions. On most Linux distributions, the default [umask](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umask.2.html) is `002`, meaning that the directory actually gets created with `0775` permissions. This allows any user with access to the system to read from Audacity‚Äôs temporary directory and, therefore, listen to the audio that it‚Äôs recording.

The simplest solution is for Audacity to create its temporary directories with `0700` permissions. However, like Zim, a better solution might be for Audacity to save its recovery files in a location that is not world readable.

## Malicious Code Injection in Apache Ant ([CVE-2020-1945](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1945), [CVE-2020-11979](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11979))

[Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) is a tool for automating software build processes. It provides a wide array of actions (called ‚Äútasks‚Äù in Ant parlance) that can be configured to run as part of the software build process. Unlike Audacity and Zim, Ant uses random names for the files it creates in `/tmp`, and an attacker cannot predict them in advance. However, Ant does not make any attempt to create files with secure permissions. The permissions of Ant‚Äôs temporary files are, therefore, only as secure as the user‚Äôs umask.

For most Ant tasks that create temporary files, this results in an information disclosure, as unauthorized users may be allowed to read the temporary files that Ant creates in `/tmp`. For the [FixCRLF](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/fixcrlf.html) task, however, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. This task adjusts text files so that they conform to a set of conventions. For example, FixCRLF can automatically fix end-of-line characters during build. In order to do this, it:

1. Makes a copy of the text file in `/tmp/fixcrlfXXXXXXX`, where Xs represent random numbers.
2. Modifies the temporary file to conform to a predefined set of conventions.
3. Checks to see whether the modified file in `/tmp` differs from the original.
   1. If the temporary file differs from the original, then the original file is overwritten by the temporary file.
4. Deletes the temporary file.

Because these files are created in `/tmp`, an unauthorized user may be able to read their contents¬†at any time before step 4 completes, resulting in an information disclosure vulnerability. If the user‚Äôs umask is sufficiently loose, an unauthorized user may have write permissions on these temporary files. This means that, between steps 2 and 3, an attacker could modify the contents of the temporary file.

If the attacker is able to modify the temporary file‚Äôs contents, the attacker could execute arbitrary code as another user. For example, if the file contains source code, any user could potentially inject malicious source code into the temporary file after FixCRLF completes its modifications but before it performs its check in step 3. Then, when step 3 runs, the temporary file would be guaranteed to differ from the original. FixCRLF would then overwrite the original file with the new, malicious file. The malicious source file would then be built into the project. When the project is run, it would run the malicious code that was originally injected into the temporary file.

To remedy this issue, the maintainers of Apache Ant have implemented two safeguards:

1. By default, files are created with more secure permissions that do not allow anyone but the owner to read or write to them.
2. A new option, `ant.tmpfile`, has been added so that Ant can be instructed to store its temporary files in a location that is not world read/writable.

## Conclusion

In practice, vulnerabilities involving `/tmp` often have minimal impact[3](#easy-footnote-bottom-3-758 "Though, in some cases, such as <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10174\">this one</a>, the impact can be severe."). Furthermore, they are easy to work around or mitigate (by setting a more restrictive umask, like `027` or `077`). Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires the attacker to have local access, and this is only the case in multiuser environments or if a system has already been compromised.

Even low-severity vulnerabilities can be used to cause irreparable damage in specific cases. Generally, the use of `/tmp` should be avoided. If `/tmp` must be used, extra care should be taken to ensure that temporary files are created and handled safely.

---

1. It‚Äôs not just `/tmp` you need to be concerned about. Improper usage of other directories, such as `/var/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, and `/var/run`, can lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. The Audacity development team was notified of this vulnerability privately on March 10, 2020. As of November 28, 2020, they‚Äôve not notified me of any plans to resolve the issue.
3. Though, in some cases, such as [this one](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10174), the impact can be severe.
