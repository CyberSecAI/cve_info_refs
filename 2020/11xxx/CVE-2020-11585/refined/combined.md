# DotNetNuke 9.5 File Path Information Disclosure (CVE-2020-11585 )

## Overview

* Discoverer: Connor Neff
* Vendor & Product: DotNetNuke
* Version: 9.5
* CVE Number: [CVE-2020-11585](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11585)

## Introduction

There is an information disclosure issue in DotNetNuke CMS (DNN) v.9.5 within the built in Message Center Module. A registered user is able to enumerate any file in the Admin File Manager that is not contained in a secure folder by sending themselves a message with the file attached.

## Demo

To set up the demo for the attack, I uploaded a file named “password.txt” in the root DNN folder. The root folder, by default, is not a secure folder so the file will be accessible.

![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-11.39.22-am.png?w=1024)

The file has a “fileId” of 144 as shown below.

* ![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-11.40.03-am.png?w=1024)

To start the attack, log into a registered users account. Go to the Messaging module at “[https://yoursitehere/Activity-Feed/Messaging/Userid/<Registered](https://yoursitehere/Activity-Feed/Messaging/Userid/%3CRegistered) User ID>”.

* ![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-11.42.11-am.png?w=1024)

Compose a new message and set up Burp Suite to intercept the message before pressing send.

![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-11.42.56-am.png?w=1024)

Once the message is sent, go to the Burp Suite intercepted web request and modify the parameter “fileIds” and insert the file ID.

* ![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-11.43.33-am.png?w=1024)

This attaches the “password.txt” file to the message and you are able to open up the file within the sent Message.

![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-11.44.18-am.png?w=1024)

The “fileIds” parameter makes accessing these files simple due to the easily guessable number identifier. The ID iterates by one each time a new file is uploaded.

A user is also able to upload multiple file ID’s in one request which makes it easier to enumerate files in a single request.

* ![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-6.06.57-pm.png?w=1024)

![](https://neff.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-23-at-11.48.01-am.png?w=1024)
## Impact

This vulnerability could help an attacker easily discover sensitive information hosted on the DNN website without having to know the website file path to access the file.

## Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure all sensitive files are stored in a “secure” folder. “Secure” folders need to be created by an administrator within the File-Management module (see screenshot below). By default the root folder is not a “secure” folder. All files stored in the root directory are not considered secure.
