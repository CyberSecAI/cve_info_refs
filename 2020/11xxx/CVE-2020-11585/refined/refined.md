{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DotNetNuke CMS (DNN) v.9.5 Message Center module allows a registered user to attach files from the Admin File Manager to a message.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure due to insecure handling of file attachments.",
      "Lack of access control on file attachments within messages.",
      "The 'fileIds' parameter uses easily guessable integer identifiers."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can enumerate and access any file within the Admin File Manager that is not stored in a secure folder, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information without knowing the website file path.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A registered user sends a message to themselves using the Message Center module.",
       "The attacker intercepts the message using a tool like Burp Suite.",
      "The attacker modifies the 'fileIds' parameter in the intercepted message to attach the desired file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a registered user account on the DotNetNuke CMS v.9.5 instance.",
     "additional_details": "The file IDs increment by one with each newly uploaded file. Multiple file IDs can be included in a single request, enabling easier file enumeration."
