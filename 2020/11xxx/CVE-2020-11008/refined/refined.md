## CVE-2020-11008 Analysis

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11008:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The vulnerability lies in how Git handles crafted URLs, specifically those that:
    *   Contain a newline character.
    *   Have an empty host.
    *   Lack a scheme (e.g., `http://`, `https://`).

When such a crafted URL is processed, the credential helper mechanism fails to extract the correct host and protocol. This leads to the credential helper providing credentials that are not appropriate for the intended host or protocol.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Improper Input Validation**: Git's credential handling mechanism does not properly validate or sanitize URLs, allowing newline characters, empty hosts, or missing schemes to be processed.
*   **Credential Helper Logic**: The vulnerability leverages the way credential helpers handle missing or malformed host information.  When the "host" parameter is absent, some credential helpers fallback to returning credentials for an unspecified or arbitrary host.

**3. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Credential Leakage**: An attacker can craft a malicious URL that causes the Git client to send credentials intended for a legitimate server to a server controlled by the attacker. The attacker does not get to choose _which_ credentials get leaked but will obtain credentials for a potentially unspecified host.
*   **Unauthorized Access**: If the leaked credentials are valid, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the victim's account on the legitimate server.

**4. Attack Vectors**

*   **Malicious URLs**: An attacker can distribute specially crafted URLs through:
    *   `git clone` commands: Tricking a user into cloning a malicious repository via a crafted URL.
    *   `.gitmodules` files: Embedding malicious URLs in submodules that are cloned using `git clone --recurse-submodules` or `git submodule update`.
    *   Package systems: Using package systems that rely on Git and may clone URLs without user oversight.
   
**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Crafted URL**: The attacker must be able to create a URL that contains either a newline character, has an empty host or lacks a scheme.
*   **Distribution**: The attacker must be able to distribute the crafted URL to potential victims, either through direct links, malicious repositories, compromised websites, etc.
*   **No direct control of credential**: Unlike CVE-2020-5260, where an attacker could get credentials for a host of their choosing, in this case, the attacker would be getting some unspecified (i.e. a potentially arbitrary, depending on the configuration of the credential helper) credential.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-5260, where a crafted URL with a newline could cause credential leakage. This vulnerability expands on that by targeting URLs that lack a scheme or contain an empty host.
*   The fix involves refusing to work with under-specified credential patterns, blocking such malformed URLs.  URLs without a scheme are treated as invalid. Relative URLs in .gitmodules that resolve to a missing scheme via leading "../" are also treated as invalid.  URLs with empty host are parsed as having empty string as host.
*   The commit `c44088ecc4b0722636e0a305f9608d3047197282` on github contains fix for this.

**Affected Versions**
* git versions <= 2.17.3, 2.18.2, 2.19.3, 2.20.2, 2.21.1, 2.22.2, 2.23.1, 2.24.1, 2.25.2, 2.26.0

**Patched Versions**
* 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1

**Mitigation**:
* Disable credential helpers via:
```
git config --unset credential.helper
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --system --unset credential.helper
```
* Avoid malicious URLs by examining the host and username portion of URLs for encoded newlines, syntactic oddities, or avoid using submodules or tools that use git clone on untrusted repositories.
