The provided content discusses two local security vulnerabilities in the Zoom macOS client, but does not mention any CVE number. Therefore, this content is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2020-11469.

The identified vulnerabilities are:

**1. Privilege Escalation to Root:**
   - **Root Cause:** The Zoom installer uses the deprecated `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to execute a bash script (`runwithroot`) with root privileges. This API does not validate the executable, which allows an attacker to replace the script with their own malicious one.
   - **Weakness:** Use of the deprecated `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API without proper validation of the executable.
   - **Impact:** An unprivileged attacker can gain root privileges by replacing the `runwithroot` script.
   - **Attack Vector:** A local attacker replaces the `runwithroot` script in a user-writable temporary directory before the installer executes it.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Local access to the system, ability to modify files in a temporary directory where the installer extracts the `runwithroot` script.

**2. Code Injection for Mic & Camera Access:**
   - **Root Cause:** The Zoom application has the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement, which disables library validation despite being compiled with the "Hardened Runtime." This allows for dynamic library injection.
   - **Weakness:** The `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement bypasses the Hardened Runtime protection.
   - **Impact:**  A malicious library can be injected into Zoom's process, inheriting its mic and camera access permissions. This allows for unauthorized recording and access to those devices without further user prompts.
   - **Attack Vector:** A local attacker replaces a legitimate library used by Zoom with a malicious proxy library, which then loads the original library to maintain functionality. The malicious library has a custom constructor that will execute upon loading within Zoom's process.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Local access to the system, ability to modify files in the application bundle.

The provided content also mentions other security and privacy issues with Zoom, including a remote 0day vulnerability that allowed camera access via a website, and sending data to Facebook in the iOS application. These, however, are not directly related to the two local security flaws discussed or CVE-2020-11469.
