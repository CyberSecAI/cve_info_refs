## Overview- Ripple20

The JSOF research lab has discovered a series of zero-day vulnerabilities in a widely used low-level TCP/IP software library developed by Treck, Inc. The 19 vulnerabilities, given the name ***Ripple20***, affect hundreds of millions of devices (or more) and include multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities. The risks inherent in this situation are high. Just a few examples: data could be stolen off of a printer,  an infusion pump behavior changed, or industrial control devices could be made to malfunction. An attacker could hide malicious code within embedded devices for years. One of the vulnerabilities could enable entry from outside into the network boundaries; and this is only a small taste of the potential risks.

The interesting thing about ***Ripple20*** is the incredible extent of its impact, magnified by the supply chain factor. The wide-spread dissemination of the software library (and its internal vulnerabilities) was a natural consequence of the supply chain “ripple-effect”. A single vulnerable component, though it may be relatively small in and of itself, can ripple outward to impact a wide range of industries, applications, companies, and people.

***Ripple20*** reached critical IoT devices from a wide range of fields, involving a diverse group of vendors. Affected vendors range from one-person boutique shops to Fortune 500 multinational corporations, including HP, Schneider Electric, Intel,  Rockwell Automation, Caterpillar, Baxter, as well as many other major international vendors suspected of being of vulnerable in medical, transportation, industrial control, enterprise, energy (oil/gas), telecom, retail and commerce, and other industries.

A detailed technical report of two of the vulnerabilities and their exploitation can be found in the **CVE-2020-11896/CVE-2020-11898 whitepaper** ([click here](#ripple-whitepaper)).

JSOF has demonstrated exploitation of these vulnerabilities on different devices as a proof-of-concept. Watch us turn off the plug on a UPS:

JSOF will be providing scripts for the identification of products running Treck upon request.

## **Following the software trail**

The software library spread far and wide, to the point that tracking it down has been a major challenge. As we traced through the distribution trail of Treck’s TCP/IP library , we discovered that over the past two decades this basic piece of networking software has been spreading around the world, through both direct and indirect use. As a dissemination vector, the complex supply chain provides the perfect channel, making it possible for the original vulnerability to infiltrate and camouflage itself almost endlessly.

We even discovered different branches in different geographic areas. Back in the 1990s, Treck collaborated with a Japanese company named Elmic Systems. They later split apart and went their separate ways. This resulted in two separate branches of the TCP/IP stack devices – one managed by Treck and one managed by Elmic Systems – marketed in totally separate areas, with no contact between them.

Other than ELMIC, the Treck stack could also be known by other names: Net+ OS, Quadnet, GHNET v2, Kwiknet.

JSOF has been invited to speak about these vulnerabilities at [Black Hat USA, August 2020](https://www.blackhat.com/us-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#hacking-the-supply-chain--vulnerabilities-haunt-tens-of-millions-of-critical-devices-19493).

## Risk Evaluation and Mitigations

***Ripple20*** poses a significant risk from the devices still in use. Potential risk scenarios include:

**•** An attacker from outside the network taking control over a device within the network, if internet facing.

**•** An attacker who has already managed to infiltrate a network can use the library vulnerabilities to target specific devices within it.

**•** An attacker could broadcast an attack capable of taking over all impacted devices in the network simultaneously.

**•** An attacker may utilize affected device as a way to remain hidden within the network for years

**•** A sophisticated attacker can potentially perform an attack on a device within the network, from outside the network boundaries, thus bypassing NAT configurations. This can be done by performing a MITM attack or a dns cache poisoning.

**•** In some scenarios, an attacker may be able to perform attacks from outside the network by replying to packets that leave network boundaries, bypassing NAT

In all scenarios, an attacker can gain complete control over the targeted device remotely, with no user interaction required.

JSOF recommends taking measures to minimize or mitigate the risk of device exploitation. Mitigation options depend on the context. Device vendors would have different approaches from network operators. In general, we recommend the following steps:

* All organizations must perform a comprehensive risk assessment before deploying defensive measures.
* First deploy defensive measures in a passive “alert” mode.
* Mitigation for device vendors:
  + Determine if you use a vulnerable Treck stack
  + Contact Treck to understand risks
  + Update to latest Treck stack version  (6.0.1.67 or higher)
  + If updates are not possible, consider disabling vulnerable features, if possible
* Mitigation for operators and networks:
  (based on CERT/CC and CISA ICS-CERT advisories)
  + The first and best mitigation is updating to patched versions of all devices.
  + If devices cannot be updated, the following steps are recommended:
    - Minimize network exposure for embedded and critical devices, keeping exposure to the minimum necessary, and ensuring that devices are not accessible from the Internet unless absolutely essential.
    - Segregate OT networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
    - Enable only secure remote access methods.
  + Block anomalous IP traffic.
  + Block network attacks via deep packet inspection, to reduce risk to your Treck embedded TCP/IP-enabled devices.

Pre-emptive traffic filtering is an effective technique that can be applied as appropriate to your network environment. Filtering options include:

• Normalize or block IP fragments, if not supported in your environment.
• Disable or block IP tunneling (IPv6-in-IPv4 or IP-in-IP tunneling), if not required.
• Block IP source routing, and any IPv6 deprecated features, like routing headers VU#267289
• Enforced TCP inspection, rejecting malformed TCP packets.
• Block unused ICMP control messages, such as MTU update and Address Mask updates.
• Normalize DNS through a secure recursive server or DNS inspection firewall.              (Verify that your recursive DNS server normalizes requests.)
• Provide DHCP/DHCPv6 security, with features such as DHCP snooping.
• Disable/Block IPv6 multicast capabilities if not used in the switching infrastructure.
• Disable DHCP where static IPs can be used.
• Employ network IDS and IPS signatures.

**•** Employ network segmentation, if available.

## Technical overview

***Ripple20*** is a set of 19 vulnerabilities found on the Treck TCP/IP stack . Four of the Ripple20 vulnerabilities are rated critical, with CVSS scores over 9 and enable Remote Code Execution. One of the critical vulnerabilities is in the DNS protocol and may potentially be exploitable by a sophisticated attacker over the internet, from outside the network boundaries, even on devices that are not connected to the internet.

 A second Whitepaper, to be released following BlackHat USA 2020 will be detailing the exploitation of CVE-2020-11901, a DNS vulnerability, on a Schneider Electric APC UPS device.  The other 15 vulnerabilities are in ranging degrees of severity with CVSS score ranging from 3.1 to 8.2, and effects ranging from Denial of Service to potential Remote Code Execution.

Most of the vulnerabilities are true Zero-days, with 4 of them having been closed over the years as part of routine code changes, but remained open in some of the affected devices (3 lower severity, 1 higher). Many of the vulnerabilities have several variants due to the Stack configurability and code changes over the years.

***Ripple20*** are the only vulnerabilities reported in Treck to date as far as we know, except for some general logical vulnerabilities referenced in the past which pertained to many stack implementations and usually had to do with RFC misinterpretations or deprecated RFCs.

***Ripple20*** vulnerabilities are unique both in their widespread effect and impact due to supply chain effect and being vulnerabilities allowing attackers to bypass NAT and firewalls and take control of devices  undetected, with no user interaction required. This is due to the vulnerabilities being in a low level TCP/IP stack, and the fact that for many of the vulnerabilities, the packets sent are very similar to valid packets, or, in some cases are completely valid packets. This enables the attack to pass as legitimate traffic.

A white paper describing a third vulnerability and exploitation on the UPS will be released following Black Hat USA 2020.

Vulnerabilities include:

| CVE ID | CVSSv3 | Description | Potential Impact | Fixed on Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2020-11896 | 10 | This vulnerability can be triggered by sending multiple malformed IPv4 packets to a device supporting IPv4 tunneling. It affects any device running Treck with a specific configuration. It can allow a stable remote code execution and has been demonstrated on a Digi International device. Variants of this Issue can be triggered to cause a Denial of Service or a persistent Denial of Service, requiring a hard reset. | Remote  Code  Execution | 6.0.1.66  (release 30/03/2020) |
| CVE-2020-11897 | 10 | This vulnerability can be triggered by sending multiple malformed IPv6 packets to a device. It affects any device running an older version of Treck with IPv6 support, and was previously fixed as a routine code change. It can potentially allow a stable remote code execution. | Out-of-Bounds  Write | 5.0.1.35  (release 04/06/2009) |
| CVE-2020-11901 | 9 | This vulnerability can be triggered by answering a single DNS request made from the device. It affects any device running Treck with DNS support and we have demonstrated that it can be used to perform Remote Code Execution on a Schneider Electric APC UPS. In our opinion this is the most severe of the vulnerabilities despite having a CVSS score of 9.0, due to the fact that DNS requests may leave the network in which the device is located, and a sophisticated attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to take over a device from outside the network through DNS cache poisoning, or other methods. Thus an attacker can infiltrate the network and take over the device with one vulnerability bypassing any security measures.  The malformed packet is almost completely RFC compliant, and so it will likely be difficult for security products such as firewalls to detect this vulnerability. On very old versions of the Treck stack, still running on some devices, the transaction ID is not randomized making the attack easier. | Remote  Code  Execution | 6.0.1.66  (release 03/03/2020) |

## Supply Chain

To effectively address the dangers of ***Ripple20***, the widespread distribution pattern must be painstakingly traced through the complex supply chain. During the disclosure process, JSOF tracked the supply chain in creative ways, in an attempt to understand the scale of distribution and the scope of the problem. That was when we started to appreciate just how extensive the supply chain picture really was. During the disclosure process we were also notified that there are 2 additional vulnerabilities disclosed anonymously at the same time. These are part of the 19 Ripple20 vulnerabilities, and all parties involved have been handling these vulnerabilities as part of the same disclosure process, and there are no further actions for vendors to take.

We could track the supply chain trails, but we needed to work with international organizations to extend our reach within organizations and domains for which we had no access. This is why the ***Ripple20*** disclosure process is being coordinated and overseen by multiple national computer emergency response team (CERT) organizations and regulators. We have also been collaborating with other security vendors. As can be understood from the scale of the problem, teamwork here is essential, and benefits all players.

Once ***Ripple20*** is publicized, we are hoping to increase awareness, enabling more companies to use the information to determine for themselves if their products, or products they are using, are vulnerable.

We will be releasing a blog post dedicated to the methods we used to track the supply chain and discover its complexities.

## **Vulnerability: dependent on the affected industry or sectors**

In the case of ***Ripple20***, the starting point was embedded into Treck’s TCP/IP low-level Internet protocol suite library. The library could be used as-is, configured for a wide range of uses, or incorporated into a larger library. The user could buy the library in source code format and edit it extensively. It can be incorporated into the code and implanted into a wide range of device types. The original purchaser could decide to rebrand, or could be acquired by a different corporation, with the original library history lost in company archives. Over time, the original library component could become virtually unrecognizable. This is why, long after the original vulnerability was identified and patched, vulnerabilities may still remain in the field, since tracing the supply chain trail may be practically impossible.

JSOF has conducted extensive, in-depth analysis, over many months, of the vendors affected by the Treck Internet protocol library vulnerability. The first challenge we experienced was simply being able to identify the relevant vendors Vendor identity could be obscured through the intricacies of the supply chain. Even when the vendors are identified, patch implementation is complex and not always possible. Over the course of the disclosure process we found that while patching was difficult for some vendors, it could potentially be even more difficult or close to impossible for some end users to install the patches. (For example, if the library is on a separate physical component or the company that produced the component has ceased operations.)

The number of devices that contain the vulnerable code base library is only a preliminary estimate; the number may realistically be in the billions.

## Disclosure

### **From the beginning**

The story of ***Ripple20*** begins September 2019, when we decided to begin some part-time research into the Treck TCP/IP library. Within a few months, we realized there was some troubling data on potential vulnerabilities and contacted Treck to share our information as well as kick off a coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) process. We understood from the beginning that Treck worked with many different vendors, with the potential to impact a large number of users. However, we simply had no idea of the scale and sheer magnitude of the situation, nor how complex the supply chain had become.

Our outreach to Treck was initially challenging. Treck is a small company serving a niche clientele, and not generally available for individual consumer approach. They also never appear to have been the target of independent security research. Eventually, we managed to track down an email contact at Treck and received an introduction. We notified them that we found a critical security vulnerability in their TCP/IP stack library, and it was our preference to work directly with them. Initially, we were faced with minimal communication. We later learned that Treck was assessing the information internally and with their legal advisors. (We also noticed litigation lawyers checking us out on LinkedIn and elsewhere).

Subsequently, we started to contact a few select vendors (such as Digi, HP, Intel, and Quadros) that we knew used Treck products and its vulnerable TCP/IP stack library, and asked them to help us make the appropriate connection with Treck. After this vendor outreach, the ball started rolling with Treck.

### **Working with Treck**

Once Treck understood the gravity of the vulnerabilities, we worked cooperatively together, and JSOF provided them with descriptions of the vulnerabilities and some other information.

It was important to us that Treck would make sure their clients were notified of the vulnerabilities at hand. Due to NDAs and other complexities, Treck was not able to provide us with a list of its clients and users of the code library. This was our first brush with some of the supply chain challenges. As a result, Treck ended up taking the lead on the disclosure process, as they were best suited to notify their clients and provide the appropriate patches.

Interestingly, the process of remediating the vulnerability led some of Treck’s clients to renew support contracts, thus Treck seems to have ended up profiting from the situation. When these companies were notified about ***Ripple20*** and well understood the potential risks, they soon realized the necessity of ongoing maintenance and importance of access to patches. In the end, many of the companies worked with Treck to either renew their contracts or make other arrangements. This is a thought-provoking lesson for both small and large vendors wary of facing security issues. A proactive security response approach means clients have a reason to pay for maintenance and support in order to keep the software up to date.

Standard industry practice is not to publicize a vulnerability until there is a patch available to fix it. We agreed on a standard 90-day period within which Treck would fix the vulnerabilities and notify their clients of the patch. Treck had the patch available around the end of March – 45 days before the 90-day deadline, and informed us that they would be reaching out to all affected clients to inform them of these vulnerabilities.

The disclosure was postponed twice after requests for more time came from some of the participating vendors, with some of the vendors voicing Covid-19-related delays. Out of consideration for these companies, the time period was extended from 90 days to over 120 days. Even so, some of the participating companies became difficult to deal with, as they made extra demands and some, from our perspective, seemed much more concerned with their brand’s image than with patching the vulnerabilities.

After some deliberation, June 16 was the date chosen for publicizing ***Ripple20***. In the interim, once we understood the extent of the vulnerabilities and the sheer numbers involved, we focused on how to best use our time (120 days of patience) to identify and help to address all of the parties that could be at risk.

### **An international effort**

Since Treck was unable to supply us with a comprehensive list of their clientele, we decided to create our own, in order to find out who was affected and ensure that everyone was notified and would have the vulnerability patched. We used a creative supply chain tracking approach, in an attempt to understand the scale of distribution and the extent of the problem. We soon began to realize and appreciate just how complex the supply chain picture really was.

It became clear to us that tracking the extent of Treck library distribution was too large for just one small team. We could track the supply chain trails, but we needed to work with international organizations to extend our reach within organizations and domains for which we had no access.

This is why the ***Ripple20*** disclosure process is being coordinated and overseen by multiple national computer emergency response team (CERT) organizations and regulators. All are collaborating in order to reach as many affected vendors as possible before the vulnerabilities became public. Our collaborators initially included:

* The CERT Coordination Center (**CERT/CC**), the worldwide center for coordinating information about Internet security at Carnegie Mellon University. This is the first (and most well-known) CERT.
* The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (**CISA**), part of the Department of Homeland Security (**DHS**)

CERT groups focus on ways to identify and mitigate security risks. For example, they can reach a much larger target group of potential users with blast announcements, “mass-mailings” that they broadcast to a long list of participating companies to notify them of the potential vulnerability. Once users are identified, mitigation comes into play. While the best response might be to install the original Treck patch, there are many situations in which installing the original patch is not possible. CERTs work to develop alternative approaches that can be used to minimize or effectively eliminate the risk, even if patching is not an option.

JSOF assisted with coordinating the disclosure process, including providing proof of concept scripts for some of the vulnerabilities, suggesting mitigations, and providing additional lists of users of the Treck library. We tracked these users down in a variety of creative ways, including working with partners as well as some interesting open-source intelligence collections .

Working with international groups was essential in this case for another reason. Back in the 1990s, Treck collaborated with a Japanese company named Elmic Systems. Published information suggests the two companies co-developed the TCP/IP stack, though we are not sure exactly how this collaboration evolved over the years. Treck and Elmic later split apart and went their separate ways. Treck now markets this stack as Treck TCP/IP in the U.S., while Elmic Systems, now called Zuken Elmic, markets it as Kasago TCP/IP in Asia. This resulted in two separate branches of the TCP/IP stack devices – one managed by Treck and one managed by Elmic Systems – marketed in totally separate geographic areas, with no cooperation between them to the best of our knowledge, until we reported the vulnerabilities. We had tried to contact Zuken Elmic early on, but were not successful; they stopped replying after a short email correspondence. (We even tried to send some emails in Japanese!) Later on, CERT/CC was able to coordinate with JPCERT/CC, a Japanese national CERT organization, who is handling the follow-up with Elmic Systems and other affected companies in the Japanese/Asian supply chain. We have confirmed with Zuken Elmic that their TCP/IP stack is affected by some of the Treck vulnerabilities. Initial research shows Kasago to be in widespread use, providing the beginning of a completely different supply chain.

### **Teamwork: in everyone’s best interest**

We have been collaborating with security vendors ***CyberMDX*** (medical device cybersecurity solution) and ***Forescout*** (device visibility and control). In our lab, we worked with the Treck TCP/IP library to identify the relevant network signatures. We then shared the network signatures with CyberMDX and Forescout. Each checked their own extensive client networks for these signatures, to identify more affected devices and components.

Note that this type of collaboration in the cybersecurity community benefits all participants, and is the first of its kind to our knowledge. We expanded the range of companies and devices that can be identified, while CyberMDX and Forescout are able to already provide their clients with mitigations and visibility, even before the issue is publicized. Additional companies were involved that have asked not to be named. These collaborations proved effective even though they were begun quite late in the disclosure process. We have no doubt that future collaborations of this type can be started earlier and provide immense value for all parties.

We also developed a script that companies can run themselves, to identify Treck products in their own networks. This will not be 100% effective at this stage, but can be an efficient, effective complementary approach, since it addresses the difficulty in identifying relevant users in a cloudy supply chain trail.

The bottom line is that teamwork benefits all players.

Abstract

JSOF  research  lab  has  discovered  a  series  of  multiple  zero  day  vulnerabilities  in  the  Treck
TCP/IP  stack  that  is  widely  used  in  embedded  and  IoT  devices.

In  this  document  we  will  be  giving  some  background  on  Ripple20  and  the  Treck  TCP/IP
stack and explain the details and exploitation of two of the vulnerabilities found in the IP frag-
mentation  component,  both  result  from  the  same  root  cause.

One  of  these  vulnerabilities  is  an  RCE  and  the  other  an  information  leak.  We  developed  a
proof-of-concept  exploit  on  a  Digi  Connect  ME  9210  device,  which  is  an  Ethernet  system-on-
module  embedded  in  to  other  devices  as  a  communication  component.  Any  device  embedding
this component, or any of a series of other components from the same line, are probably aﬀected
by  the  same  vulnerabilities  and  can  be  exploited  with  the  same  techniques.

A  second  white-paper,  to  be  released  following  BlackHat  USA  2020,  will  be  detailing  the
exploitation of CVE-2020-11901, a DNS vulnerability, on a Schneider-Electric APC UPS device.

What is Ripple20?

Ripple20 is a series of 19 zero day vulnerabilities that aﬀect hundreds of millions of devices, and
were discovered by JSOF research labs in a TCP/IP stack that is widely used in embedded and
IoT devices.

The starting point for these vulnerabilities is an embedded TCP/IP low-level Internet proto-
col suite library by a company called Treck, inc. This is a basic networking element, a building
block, useful in any context, for any device that works over a network.
Treck TCP/IP is a proprietary fully featured TCP/IP communication stack designed for em-
bedded devices and real-time operating systems. While our research was focused on security,
our general impression is that it works well and has high performance. The large client base
would suggest the same.

In their own words:

“Treck TCP/IP is designed to be high performing, scalable and conﬁgurable for easy
integration into any environment regardless of processor, commercial RTOS, pro-
prietary RTOS, or if no RTOS is being used. By designing API’s to interface the
kernel, timer, driver, sockets the Treck TCP/IP provides easy integration into a wide
variety of embedded products.”

The damaging eﬀects of a these vulnerabilities has been ampliﬁed like a ripple eﬀect to a
dramatic extent due to the supply chain factor. A single corrupt component, though it may be
relatively small, impacts a wide range of industries, applications, companies, and people.

The vulnerabilities have a wide aﬀect on entire supply chains in almost all sectors in the
IoT and embedded device world. The vendors that produce the aﬀected device range from one-
person boutique shops to fortune 500 multinational corporations, and from connected smart
homes to industrial and medical device.

Of these vulnerabilities:

• 4 are critical remote code execution vulnerabilities with CVSS ≥ 9

• 4 are major with a CVSS ≥ 7

• 11 more have various lower severity, information leaks, DoS and others

[Of the 19 vulnerabilities, 2 were reported anonymously and the rest were reported by JSOF.]

We named the vulnerabilities Ripple20 to capture the ripple eﬀect caused by these vulnera-
bilities, the “20” added at the end has multiple meanings for us:

• The vulnerabilities were reported in 2020.

• The Treck stack has been around for more than 20 years. Possibly the vulnerabilities too.

• There are 19 vulnerabilities, and just like the candles on a birthday cake we are adding

one for next year!

CVE-2020-11896 Overview

CVE-2020-11896  is  a  critical  vulnerability  in  Treck  TCP/IP  stack.  It  allows  for  Remote  Code
execution  by  any  attacker  that  can  send  UDP  packets  to  an  open  port  on  the  target  device.  A
prerequisite of this vulnerability is that the device supports IP fragmentation with IP tunneling.
In  some  of  the  cases  where  this  prerequisite  is  not  met,  there  will  remain  a  DoS  vulnerability.

2.1  Preliminary  Networking  Concepts

To understand this vulnerability we need to familiarize ourselves with two networking concepts:
IPv4  fragmentation  and  tunneling.

2.1.1

IPv4  Fragmentation

IP fragmentation makes it possible an IP packet to be sent in a network even in cases where its
size  is  larger  than  the  maximum  size  allowed  in  a  speciﬁc  link  of  a  network.  IP  fragmentation
is  a  technique  where  the  packet  is  split  in  to  several  smaller  parts  (“fragments”)  to  support
transmission  over  those  links  and  networks.  The  protocol  supports  fragmentation  and  then
reassembly  of  th  packets.  IPv4  fragmentation  is  described  in  [1].

Diﬀerent  fragments  are  grouped  using  an  identiﬁcation  ﬁeld  in  the  IP  header.  This  identi-
ﬁcation  ﬁeld  describes  which  packet  a  fragment  belongs  to.  This  allows  for  diﬀerent  packets  to
travel fragmented through the network and be reassembled correctly on the other side.  The last
fragment  has  the  MF  (More  Fragments)  bit  ﬂag  set  to  0,  where  all  other  fragments  have  MF=1.

It is the responsibility of the network stack to fragment a large packet and send the multiple
fragments  over  the  network.  An  example  would  be  a  UDP  application  which  asks  to  send  a
large  datagram.  It  is  also  the  responsibility  of  the  network  stack  to  reassemble  a  fragmented
packet  when  it  is  received.

If  only  part  of  the  fragments  of  a  packet  arrive,  the  network  stack  will  eventually  abandon
these  fragments.  In  most  implementations,  when  any  fragment  is  processed,  the  network  stack
starts  a  timer.  When  this  timer  elapses,  the  network  stack  discards  all  the  fragments  which
belong  to  the  same  identiﬁcation  group.  This  is  done  to  prevent  overloading  of  the  device
memory.

2.1.2

IP  Tunneling

IP tunneling allows for virtual point-to-point links between two separate networks.  It is achieved
by encapsulating a packet (which may be an IP packet) within another packet, so that the inner
packet  has  a  diﬀerent  source  and  destination  addresses  than  the  outer  packet.

You can think of it as an international package shipment where the package is labeled with
the  full  source  and  destination  address  in  the  respective  countries,  but  when  the  package  is

Figure 2.1: Illustrating tunneling

 shipped overseas it is placed in a container (like a ship or plane) that only has the address of the
. destination and source port

The source and destination addresses of the outer packet are the tunnel-endpoints, and the

addresses  in  the  inner  packet  are  used  for  network  routing  on  both  ends  of  the  tunnel.

A  tunnel  entry-point  is  the  node  that  receives  an  IP  packet  that  should  be  forwarded  over
the  tunnel.  It  encapsulates  this  packet  within  an  outer  IP  packet.  When  the  packet  arrives  at
the tunnel exit-point, it is decapsulated and forwarded as if it were a regular packet sent in the
target  network.

A  prime  example  of  tunneling  usage  is  in  Virtual  Private  Network  (VPN)  technologies.
There  are  several  tunneling  protocols,  one  of  the  most  simplest  and  oldest  is  IP-in-IP  (IP

protocol  number  4).

IP-in-IP

IP-in-IP is an IP tunneling protocol where one IP packet is encapsulated in another IP packet by
adding an outer IP header with source and destination addresses that are equal to the tunnel’s
entry-point  and  exit-point,  respectively.

The  inner  packet  is  unmodiﬁed,  and  the  outer  IP  header  copies  some  ﬁelds  from  the  inner
IP  header.  The  outer  header  has  IP  protocol  number  4.  More  information  about  IP-in-IP
tunneling  can  be  found  in  [5]  and  [2].

2.2  Treck  TCP/IP  Stack  Internals

Packets in the Treck TCP/IP stack are represented by a structure called tsPacket.  Each packet
is  associated  with  a  data  buﬀer  that  holds  the  raw  data  that  arrived  from  the  interface  driver.
The tsPacket struct also holds another important structure called ttUserPacket, and a pointer
to a tsSharedData structure, which includes information that the network stack needs when it
processes  the  packet  (pointer  to  a  socket  structure,  src/dst  addresses  or  ports,  etc).

The  tsPacket  structure  contains  several  ﬁelds  involved  in  the  vulnerabilities  described  be-

low.  For  this  reason  it  is  important  to  understand  this  structure  before  continuing.

tt8Bit pktNetworkLayer; // Specifies the network layer type of this packet (IPv4, IPv6,

ARP, etc).

};

and this is the contained ttUserPacket structure (typedef of tsUserPacket):

struct tsUserPacket {

void * pktuLinkNextPtr; // Next tsUserPacket for fragmented data
ttUser8BitPtr pktuLinkDataPtr; // Pointer to data
ttPktLen pktuLinkDataLength; // Size of data pointed by pktuLinkDataPtr
ttPktLen pktuChainDataLength; // Total packet length (of chained fragmented data). Valid
(cid:44)→
int pktuLinkExtraCount; // Number of links linked to this one (not including this one).
(cid:44)→

in first link only.

Valid in first link only.

};

Both these structures are built to support IP fragmentation and so we will describe some
ﬁelds which relate to fragmentation. We could think of non-fragmented packet as a special case
of fragmentation where there is only one fragment.

The ﬁeld pktuLinkDataPtr points into the data buﬀer of the current fragment. The exact
location within this data buﬀer changes as the network stack processes the packet in diﬀerent
stages and depends on the layer of the packet which is currently being processed. For instance,
when the network stack process the Ethernet layer (in tfEtherRecv), this ﬁeld points to the
Ethernet header.

The pktuLinkDataLength ﬁeld speciﬁes the size of the data pointed to by pktuLinkDataPtr,

i.e., the size of a single fragment.

The pktuLinkNextPtr is used to keep track of the fragments in the packet. This ﬁeld points
to another tsPacket which represents the next fragment, which in turn also holds a reference
to the next fragment and so forth. For this reason we can also refer to fragments as “links” in
this linked list. If this link is the last fragment, or if the data is not fragmented, this ﬁeld will
equal NULL.

The pktuChainDataLength ﬁeld represents the packet length including all of the fragments,
It is set only for the ﬁrst fragment, and if the data is not

i.e., the total size of the packet.
fragmented it is equal to pktuLinkDataLength.

A common pattern in the stack is to adjust the pktuLinkDataPtr pointer when moving
between layers in the stack. For instance, if our packet is an ICMP echo-request packet (ping),
it will be composed of three layers: Ethernet, followed by IPv4, followed by ICMP. In this case,
when the Ethernet layer is processed (in the function tfEtherRecv), the pktuLinkDataPtr
points to the start of the Ethernet header, and then before moving to the next layer, it is
adjusted using the following code:

1

2

3

pkt->pktuLinkDataPtr = pkt->pktuLinkDataPtr + 0xe;
pkt->pktuLinkDataLength = pkt->pktuLinkDataLength - 0xe;
pkt->pktuChainDataLength = pkt->pktuChainDataLength - 0xe;

In this case, 0xe (14 in decimal) is the size of the Ethernet header (6 (dst MAC) + 6 (src

MAC) + 2 (etherType)).

When tfEtherRecv ﬁnishes with packet processing, it forwards the packet to next layer
of processing using the EtherType ﬁeld that represents the next layer’s protocol. Supported
EtherTypes encountered are ARP, IPv4 and IPv6.

Figure 2.2: Packet with fragments

In our example, when the IPv4 layer receives the packet (in the function tfIpIncomingPacket),

the pointer pktuLinkDataPtr already points past the Ethernet header, so it can safely assume
that the data pointed to by pktuLinkDataPtr is an IPv4 header.

Incoming data is processed by functions with the same naming convention tf*IncomingPacket

(as far as we’ve seen), where * is the protocol name. In the case of Ethernet/IPv4/ICMP the
packet will be processed by the functions tfEtherRecv, tfIpIncomingPacket

and tfIcmpIncomingPacket, respectively.
The Treck stack handles the reassembly of fragments in the procedure tfIpReassemblePacket,

called from tfIpIncomingPacket. This procedure is called whenever an IP fragment destined
to device is received. If there are missing fragments, the function returns NULL. Otherwise,
if all fragments arrive and there are no holes, the network stack links the fragments together
using the pktuLinkNextPtr ﬁeld and passes the packet for further processing in the next layer.
The word “reassembly” in this context does not mean copying of the packet to a contiguous
memory block, but rather simply chaining them together in a linked-list.

2.3 Vulnerability Root Cause

To understand the root cause of the vulnerability, we’ll take a quick look at two ﬁelds present
in the IP header:

• IHL (4 bits): the size of the IP header in dwords. Minimum value is 5 (20 bytes). If there
are IP options, the header length gets larger, up to a maximum value of 0xf (60 bytes).

• Total Length (2 bytes): the size of the entire IP packet in bytes (or IP fragment, if

fragmented), including the header.

The function tfIpIncomingPacket begins with some basic sanity checks. In addition to

verifying the header checksum, it also veriﬁes that:

Page 7

Ripple20 - © 2020 JSOF Ltd. JSOF

Ripple20

ip_version == 4 &&
data_available >= 21 &&
header_length >= 20 &&
total_length > header_length &&
total_length <= data_available

The “data available” is measured using the ﬁeld pktuChainDataLength.

If all sanity checks pass, the function checks whether the speciﬁed total length in the IP
header is strictly less than the packet’s pktuChainDataLength, indicating that more data was
actually received than is stated in the IP header. If it is true, a trimming operation takes place
to remove the extra data (decompilation code reorganized for clarity):

1

2

3

4

5

if ((uint)ipTotalLength <= pkt->pktuChainDataLength) {

if ((uint)ipTotalLength != pkt->pktuChainDataLength) {
pkt->pktuChainDataLength = (uint)ipTotalLength;
pkt->pktuLinkDataLength = (uint)ipTotalLength;

}
...

}

This is where the vulnerability lies. Recall that pktuLinkDataLength holds the size of
the current fragment and pktuChainDataLength holds the size of the entire packet.
If the
operation above takes place, an inconsistency is created, where pkt->pktuChainDataLength
== pkt->pktuLinkDataLength, but there might be additional fragments pointed to by

pkt->pktuLinkNextPtr. Another way to think of this is as a ﬁctitious and inconsistent
state where the total size of the fragments on the linked list is larger then the size stored in
pktuChainDataLength.

The inconsistency created by the weak trimming operation does not bode well for the rest of
the processing. However, we have another challenge to overcome. The tfIpIncomingPacket
function is called with one received fragment every time and calls tfIpReassemblePacket to
handle it. tfIpReassemblePacket is responsible for inserting the fragments in to the linked list
described above. It does not copy the fragments in to a continous memory buﬀer. When all the
fragments have been received, tfIpReassemblePacket returns the complete packet as a linked-
list of fragments for further processing on the next protocol layer. This reassembly operation
is executed after the vulnerable trimming operation. As soon as the reassmbly operation is
ﬁnished, tfIpIncomingPacket will either return or pass the packet forward for processing at
the next netowrk layer (for example: UDP). This prevents us from performing the exploit,
as we need a fragmented packet in order to reach the inconsistent state. In other words, the
vulnerable code is only supposed to be executed on a per-fragment basis (or on single- fragment
packets). If it is executed in this way, it is not actually vulnerable.

So – How can we trigger the vulnerable trimming ﬂow with incoming fragmented data so that

the aforementioned inconsistency is achieved?

2.3.1 Processing Fragmented Packet at the IP Layer

In order for the fragmented packet to be processed at the IP layer and reach the vulnerable
ﬂow, we use tunneling.

Tunneling allows for the inner IP packet to be processed by tfIpIncomingPacket as a non-
fragmented packet. The function tfIpIncomingPacket will be called twice recursively, once
for the inner layer of the IP tunneling and several times for the outer layer (once for every
fragment). First, tfIpIncomingPacket will receive all fragments from the outer layer, call
tfIpReassemblePacket on each, and once they are all received, it will pass execution to the
next protocol layer, which in this case is IPv4 again, so tfIpIncomingPacket will be called
from tfIpIncomingPacket with the inner IP layer.

Figure 2.3: Tunnel decapsulation

 Fragmenting the outer IP packet results in tfIpIncomingPacket being called with the inner
packet that now consists of several fragments but is marked as non fragmented in the IP header
(MF=0).  In  terms  of  the  data  structure  describing  the  packet,  it  is  now  composed  of  several
separate  links  in  a  linked-list,  each  with  a  separate  pktuLinkDataLength  value.

Let’s get more concrete.  Consider the following example which will accompany us through-

out  the  paper:

• Inner IP packet: IPv4{len=32, proto=17}/UDP{checksum=0, len=12} with payload ’A’*1000.

• Outer IP packet (fragment 1): IPv4{frag offset=0, MF=1, proto=4, id=0xabcd} with

40 bytes from the inner IP packet as payload.

• Outer IP packet (fragment 2): IPv4{frag offset=40, MF=0, proto=4, id=0xabcd} with

the rest of the bytes from the inner IP packet as payload.

(We set the checksum ﬁeld to 0 since that will cause the UDP checksum veriﬁcation to be

skipped.)

When the network stack handles the outer fragments, it links them using the ﬁeld
pktuLinkNextPtr in tsUserPacket structure, as already described. When the function
tfIpIncomingPacket processes the inner IP packet (due to protocol=4), it is processing in-
coming fragmented data (the inner IP packet is represented by two tsPacket structures linked
together), but will still call the vulnerable ﬂow, thus solving our challenge.

Furthermore, the inner IP packet passes the IP header sanity checks since only the
pktuChainDataLength ﬁeld of tsUserPacket is taken into account (rather than
pktuLinkDataLength). In our example, the total length of the inner IP packet (32) is smaller
than the chain-data-length (1000+8+20=1028), so the Treck stack will attempt to trim the
packet incorrectly, by setting both the ﬁelds pktuLinkDataLength and pktuChainDataLength
to the same value - the total IP length (32 in our example). This leads to a situation where the
inner IP packet is represented by two tsPacket structures linked together, but their total cusize
is larger than the pktuChainDataLength ﬁeld (instead of 1028 bytes, the pktuChainDataLength
ﬁeld equals 32 after trimming).

Achieving Heap Overﬂow using UDP 2.3.2

Now  that  we’ve  reached  an  inconsistent  state,  we  face  another  question  -  How  can  we  exploit
this  inconsistency  to  gain  a  memory  corruption  primitive?

It  turns  out  that  there  is  at  least  one  code  path  where  fragmented  data  gets  copied  into  a
single  continuous  buﬀer.  This  is  part  of  the  code  handling  UDP  datagrams.  The  internal  logic
of  this  ﬂow  consists  of  a  new  packet  being  allocated  (using  tfGetSharedBuffer),  the  size  of
which is based on the pktuChainDataLength ﬁeld, followed by a copy of the diﬀerent fragments
of  the  packet  into  the  newly  allocated  packet  one  by  one.

The function responsible for doing the copy is tfCopyPacket, which accepts a source packet

and  a  destination  packet,  in  this  order.  Here’s  an  excerpt  of  the  fragment  copy  code:

1

2

3

4

6

i = 0;
do {

memcpy(dst->pktuLinkDataPtr + i,src->pktuLinkDataPtr,src->pktuLinkDataLength);
i = i + src->pktuLinkDataLength;
src = (tsPacket *)src->pktuLinkNextPtr;

} while (src != NULL);

As you can see, the function tfCopyPacket doesn’t take into account the length of the
buﬀer it writes into. It simply takes every link from the src packet (our fragmented packet)
and copies its data into the destination packet. The destination packet was allocated based
on the pktuChainDataLength, and so if the vulnerability was previously triggered, then the
allocated buﬀer may be smaller than the sum of all the individual links in the packet after our
invalidation - hence, a heap overﬂow occurs.

One thing that remains to be described is how we trigger this ﬂow.
If an application is listening on any UDP port, a UDP packet destined to this port is passed
to a socket handling function tfSocketIncomingPacket. Its job is to append that packet to
the socket receive queue (which is later polled by the application layer).

Page 10

In our research, we found that when the socket receive queue for UDP packets is non-empty
and a new packet arrives, the ﬂow described above containing the heap overﬂow is achievable.
Take a look at this excerpt of tfSocketIncomingPacket:

local_10 = pkt;
/* ... */
if (sockEntry->socReceiveQueueNextPtr == NULL) {
sockEntry->socReceiveQueueNextPtr = pkt;
queueLastPtr = local_10;

}
else {

queueLastPtr = sockEntry->socReceiveQueueLastPtr;
if ((queueLastPtr->pktSharedDataPtr->dataFlags & 0x40) == 0) {
/* Shared data doesn't point to user device memory */
sizeOfPacketBuffer = (uint)(pkt->pktSharedDataPtr->dataBufLastPtr +
(cid:44)→

-(int)pkt->pktSharedDataPtr->dataBufFirstPtr);

}
if (protoNum == 6) {

/* Related to TCP; redacted for brevity

*/

}
else {

if (sizeOfPacketBuffer != 0) {

uVar2 = (uint)sockEntry->socRecvCopyFraction * pkt->pktuChainDataLength;
if (uVar2 <= sizeOfPacketBuffer) {

dst = tfGetSharedBuffer(0x54,pkt->pktuChainDataLength,0);
if (dst != NULL) {

tfCopyPacket(pkt,dst);
needToDrop = true;
local_10 = dst;

}

}

}
queueLastPtr->pktChainNextPtr = local_10;
queueLastPtr = local_10;

}

}

We see that in order to reach tfGetSharedBuffer we need to circumvent a check involving
socRecvCopyFraction. We don’t know its exact purpose, but through debugging and experi-
mentation we found that its value is 4 (in our case).

In our recurring example, our ﬁrst packet link has small buﬀer size so sizeOfPacketBuffer

is relatively small (on the order of 10s of bytes).

But when we reach this ﬂow, pkt->pktuChainDataLength equals 4 (after trimming it was 32,
then decremented by 20 (size of IP header) when processing the IP layer, and then decremented
again by 8 (size of UDP header)). So 4*4=16 is less than sizeOfPacketBuffer, and we pass
this check.

One last thing that we need to make sure of is that the receive queue for UDP packets is
non-empty (otherwise this ﬂow is not reached). In thoery there could be several ways to do this.
In our exploitation, we found that sending many UDP packets to the same port fast enough
would do the trick. However, getting this part to work reliably was tricky. The exploit is written
in Python using Scapy that turns out to be too slow for our purpose. To overcome the obstacle,
we used the L3socket object of Scapy and instantiated a bunch of threads that only ﬂood the
device with benign UDP packets, so that the socket receive queue will be non-empty. Writing
the code in C or Go would probably also work. Additional improvments can be made to this
part, depending on the device being exploited and the listening server.

Another obstacle is that before we arrive at tfSocketIncomingPacket, which is where the
overﬂow occurs, our vulnerable packet passes through tfUdpIncomingPacket. This function
contains some sanity checks related to UDP, so we need to pass those as well:

udpLen = udpHdr->udpLength >> 8 | udpHdr->udpLength << 8;
if ((udpLen < 8) || (*(ushort *)&pkt->pktuChainDataLength < udpLen)) goto dropPacket;
if (udpLen < *(ushort *)&pkt->pktuChainDataLength) {

tfPacketTailTrim(pkt,(uint)udpLen,0);

}
/* ... */
if ((udpHdr->udpChecksum != 0) && (tvUdpIncomingChecksumOn != 0)) {

/* Compute checksum... */

}

As we can see, we can avoid this type of trimming (not to be confused with the vulnerable
ﬂow), by ensuring that the UDP length ﬁeld equals the pktuChainDataLength ﬁeld minus the
size of the inner IP header.

To summarize:

if a UDP port is listening on our device, we can quickly send packets so
that the socket receive queue will be non-empty. At the same time, we will send a fragmented
UDP packet that triggers the vulnerability and ticks a few checkboxes. The result we expect
is a small buﬀer allocated on the heap with tfGetSharedBuffer which is then overﬂown by
tfCopyPacket.

Exploiting CVE-2020-11896 on Digi
Connect  ME  9210

We  used  a  Digi  Connect  ME  9210  device  along  with  a  development  board  for  proof-of-concept
exploit  development  and  achieved  remote  code  execution.

This device looks like an Ethernet connector, and is actually a small “ultra-compact” system-
on-module.  Its  longest  dimension  is  3.67cm  and  it  comes  fully  featured  with  a  built-in  CPU,
operating  system,  and  of  course  -  networking  stack.  The  module  can  be  programmed  and  its
ﬁrmware  can  be  customized.  It  is  presumably  used  for  oﬄoading  of  networking  capabilities
as  well  as  advanced  features  like  a  built-in  hardware  encryption  engine  and  multiple  interface
options  like  CAN-BUS.

This  is  an  interesting  device  because  it  is  highly  embeddable,  and  is  used  in  critical  set-
tings,  like  medical  devices  for  example.  This  device  can  also  be  purchased  from  any  of  the
large  electronic-parts  re-sellers.  This  makes  vulnerabilities  extremely  dangerous  as  they  could
potentially aﬀect any device embedding these modules and it is diﬃcult to know which devices
use  it.  The  device  version  we  tested  is  the  “NET+OS”  version.  There  are  diﬀerent  versions
and  we  don’t  know  if  they  are  aﬀected.

We  chose  this  device  as  a  ﬁrst  device  to  research  and  exploit  because  of  these  reasons,  as
well as the lesser complexity of exploiting with a full setup including development board, JTAG
debugger,  symbols(!)  etc.

Our proof-of-concept exploit runs a shellcode which makes a LED on the development board
blink  indeﬁnitely.  We  will  now  describe  our  exploit  -  the  primitives  established  and  the  tech-
niques used.  The exploit is probably easily adaptable to devices using the Treck stack that use
the  same  heap  conﬁguration  and  a  similar  (slightly  older)  version  of  Treck.

3.1  Exploit  Strategy

When  it  comes  to  exploiting  heap  overﬂow  vulnerabilities,  there  are  generally  two  routes:

• Override heap meta-data information.

• Overﬂow application-speciﬁc data structures.

The former is generally considered more generic, as it does not require any speciﬁc data

structure to be present, only some memory blocks, possibly with a speciﬁc size.

As the Treck stack is highly conﬁgurable, and used in many settings, and since the heap
structure seems to be very suitable for exploitation with no mitigations present, we chose to
override heap meta-data information and not rely on any speciﬁc features enabled or added by
Digi.

3.2 Treck Heap Internals

On this device the Treck TCP/IP stack uses a proprietary heap. Let’s have a look under-the-
hood.

The following description concerns the heap implementation found in Digi. Another heap
mechanism implemented by Treck is called Sheap (Simple Heap). The use of Sheap must be
enabled during compilation, and in the case of Digi, it wasn’t enabled. Treck can also use a
user-supplied heap and possibly supports other options. Note also that this device has an older
version of the Treck stack, and newer versions might have diﬀerent implementations.

The heap uses several ﬁxed-size allocation buckets, each tracked using a singly-linked list.
There is a separate component which handles allocation requests of sizes above 0x1000 (“large
allocations”).

These ﬁxed-size allocation buckets are referred to by Treck as QX, Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5
and Q6. The following table describes each bucket, its block size and the allocation size it
corresponds to:

Bucket Block Size

Allocation Size

QX
Q0
Q1
Q2
Q3
Q4
Q5
Q6

32 (0x20)
64 (0x40)
128 (0x80)
256 (0x100)
512 (0x200)
1024 (0x400)
2048 (0x800)
4096 (0x1000)

1 - 32
33 - 64
65 - 128
129 - 256
257 - 512
513 - 1024
1025 - 2048
2049 - 4096

Each bucket list serves as a free blocks cache for its associated block size. When a block is
freed, its relevant bucket is determined (using the heap metadata) and it is inserted at the head
of the list.

The Treck stack allocates memory for data buﬀers and structures mainly using tfGetRawBuffer.

This function receives a 4-byte size and returns a pointer to an allocated memory block we will
call a “raw buﬀer”, or NULL if it fails. A raw buﬀer is freed using the function tfFreeRawBuffer.
If the allocation request size is small (less than 0x1000), the appropriate free blocks cache

is consulted:

/* the rawNextPtr field is at offset 0 */
mem = bucketQueue->rawNextPtr;
if (mem != NULL) {

/* remove from head of bucket queue */
bucketQueue->rawNextPtr = mem->rawNextPtr;
/* ... */
mem->rawNextPtr = NULL;

}
/* ... */
if (mem != NULL) {

return (ttRawBufferPtr)mem;

}

If mem == NULL at the end of the cache lookup, a new block is allocated from a separate

allocator and returned:

newMemoryBlock = (uint *)tfBufferDoubleMalloc(sz + 4);
if (newMemoryBlock == NULL) {

return NULL;

}
*newMemoryBlock = sz;
/* ... */
return newMemoryBlock + 1;

For small allocations, sz refers to the size of the bucket that matches the allocation request
size.  For  large  allocations,  sz  is  the  original  allocation  request  size,  rounded-up  to  the  next
4-byte  boundary.  Note  that  sz  is  saved  on  the  heap  as  metadata.

Treck’s  function  tfBufferDoubleMalloc  doesn’t  add  meta-data  and  internally  calls
tfKernelMalloc.  In turn, tfKernelMalloc saves the requested size as meta-data and calls
the operating system malloc function.  The reason for the “double” in tfBufferDoubleMalloc
is  the  two  attempts  it  makes  calling  tfKernelMalloc  (the  second  of  them  in  the  case  that  the
ﬁrst  fails).

When  the  heap  is  initially  setup  and  the  initial  buckets  built,  the  same  ﬂow  is  used  for
each  block  -  each  block  is  allocated  separtely  by  calling  tfBufferDoubleMalloc,  and  so  every
block is actually allocated separately over several layers of allocators.  We are not sure why this
happens,  and  whether  this  is  an  artifact  of  Treck  or  Digi  code.

In  total,  three  instances  of  meta-data  are  saved  for  a  single  memory  block  allocated  using

tfGetRawBuffer:

Figure 3.1: Heap metadata

 For example, for an allocation request size of 0x9c, the Q2 bucket will be selected (block size
: 0x100). The raw buﬀer, along with its meta-data, will look like

Figure 3.2: Heap metadata example

 When  blocks  are  freed  using  tfFreeRawBuffer,  the  (third)  block  size  is  read  from  the  heap
meta-data  to  determine  the  allocation  size  (0x100  in  the  example  above).  If  the  allocation  is
large,  the  meta-data  is  removed  and  the  memory  block  is  passed  to  tfKernelFree.  For  small
allocations,  the  relevant  bucket  queue  is  determined,  and  the  free  block  (memoryBlockPtr)  is
inserted  at  the  head  of  the  free  list:

1

2

3

/* insert at the head of the free-list */
memoryBlockPtr->rawNextPtr = bucketQueue->rawNextPtr;
bucketQueue->rawNextPtr = memoryBlockPtr;

As you can see, the pointer to the next free memory block in the same bucket is stored on
the heap as the ﬁrst dword after the meta-data saved by tfGetRawBuffer. That is, a free raw
buﬀer looks like this:

Figure 3.3: Free raw-buﬀer illustration

Exploitation Technique 3.3

Considering the structure of the heap and our overﬂow primitive, we can hopefully override the
next pointer of a free raw buﬀer.  Then if we manage to allocate two raw buﬀers from the bucket
we  overrided  (or  three,  if  the  overﬂowing  buﬀer  is  freed),  the  last  raw  buﬀer  will  be  allocated
at  a  location  we  control.

Figure 3.4: Overwriting free-list rawNextPtr pointer

This embedded device runs an old ARMv9 CPU and has no meaningful exploit mitigations.
This  means  that  we  can  hopefully  allocate  a  raw  buﬀer  on  the  stack  with  controlled  data  and
run  a  shellcode  from  there.  We  might  also  write  a  ROP  chain  before  we  redirect  execution
to  the  shellcode,  so  that  it  can  perform  some  preliminary  setup.  The  setup  mostly  consists  of
invalidating  cache  so  that  our  shellcode  will  run,  since  otherwise  the  packet  allocated  on  the
stack  may  not  be  written  out  to  memory  by  the  time  we  try  to  execute  it.

You  might  ask  yourselves  at  this  point  -  why  not  directly  allocate  a  packet  on  the  code
section?  The  answer  is  that  we  could,  but  it  is  not  necessarily  simpler,  and  we  might  still  run
into  a  cache  coherency  issue.

Let’s put this theory into practice.

3.4 Some Preliminary Shaping (or: How Packets are Allocated?)

Packets, along with their data buﬀer, are allocated on the heap using a function called

Page 16

Ripple20 - © 2020 JSOF Ltd. JSOF

Ripple20

tfGetSharedBuffer. This function accepts three arguments: hdrSize, dataSize and a
flag. It returns a pointer to an initialized tsPacket structure. We already saw this function
used in tfSocketIncomingPacket when we described the vulnerability root cause.

The function tfGetSharedBuffer ﬁrst allocates a tsPacket structure. This structure is
allocated by calling the function tfRecycleAlloc. This function maintains a cache for highly
used structures used throughout the network stack. More speciﬁcally, it is used to allocate
the following fundamental structures for the Treck stack: tsPacket, tsTimer, tsRteEntry,
tsSocketEntry and tsTcpVect. Possibly more structs could be added.

Provided that the tsPacket allocation succeeds, tfGetSharedBuffer allocates a buﬀer using
tfGetRawBuffer sized roughly sizeof(struct tsSharedData) + dataSize + hdrSize.
In
unusual situations, few more bytes are added, nothing too signiﬁcant. This raw buﬀer stores
two diﬀerent things consecutively - ﬁrst the tsSharedData structure and then the continuous
data buﬀer that stores the packet data.

Through experimentation, we found that the tsPacket structure is usually allocated imme-
diately after its associated data buﬀer (which stores shared data and packet data). This could
pose a problem for our exploitation technique, because we don’t want to override a tsPacket
structure.

To understand how we can solve this issue, let’s take a quick look at tfRecycleAlloc:

size = tlRecycleArray[recycleIndex].recySize;
m = ((ttRcylPtr)tlRecycleArray[recycleIndex].recyListPtrPtr)->rcylNextPtr;
if (m == NULL) {

m = (tsRecycleEntry *)tfBufferDoubleMalloc(size);
if (m == NULL) {
return NULL;

}
/* ... */

} else {

/* unlink from head */
((ttRcylPtr)tlRecycleArray[recycleIndex].recyListPtrPtr)->rcylNextPtr = m->rcylNextPtr;
/* ... */

}
/* ... */
return m;

As we can see - if the recycle list is empty, a new buﬀer is allocated using our old acquaintance
tfBufferDoubleMalloc. Thus, in order to overcome our previously stated challenge, we can
cause tfRecycleAlloc to be called enough times. This makes the “recycle array” grow in
size, and any future allocations of tsPacket structures will be allocated in the recycle array,
in a memory area “behind us”, making sure we don’t overﬂow this struct. We need to do this
quickly: after a packet is processed, it is dropped and its underlying tsPacket structure is freed
(using tfRecycleFree).

In summary: We need to ﬂood our device with packets, so that many tsPackets will
be allocated relatively at the start of the heap. Then, whenever a new packet is allocated
using tfGetSharedBuffer, the request for tsPacket structure will be serviced from the recycle
list (there are plenty of tsPacket structures in the list now). This allow us to proceed with
overﬂowing free raw buﬀers.

3.5 Choosing an Allocation Size

Recall the example packets described earlier when looking at the vulnerability root cause. If
we manage to trigger our vulnerable ﬂow in tfSocketIncomingPacket, the following line will
be triggered with pkt->pktuChainDataLength == 4:

tfGetSharedBuffer(0x54,pkt->pktuChainDataLength,0);

One of the side eﬀects of this call is the allocation of a raw buﬀer from the Q2 bucket (block

size  0x100).

Knowing how the heap operates, if there is a free raw buﬀer directly after our allocation we

will  be  able  to  override  the  next  pointer  in  that  block,  thus  corrupting  the  free-list.

The  easiest  way  to  shape  the  heap  in  such  a  way  is  to  ﬁnd  some  primitive  that  we  can
use  to  allocate  raw  buﬀers  from  the  same  bucket  Q2  (block  size  0x100).  Such  a  primitive  can
hopefully  be  used  to  allocate  several  contiguous  raw  buﬀers  of  size  0x100.  We  might  need  to
reverse the order of the ﬁrst two allocations, depending on the order these allocations are freed
and  considering  that  the  list  operates  in  LIFO  mode.

To illustrate the point, consider the following hypothetical scenario.  We allocate 5 blocks of
size  0x100,  named  A-E.  Block  A  is  allocated  ﬁrst  at  address  0x1000,  block  B  is  allocated  right
after  block  A,  at  address  0x1100  and  so  on.  It  so  happens  that  the  ﬁrst  allocated  block  (block
A) is also the ﬁrst block to be freed. After the 5 blocks were freed, our Q2 free-list will look like:

If our evil allocation will be performed in this state, then we will get block E at address 0x1400
and overﬂow bytes past the address 0x1500, and we don’t know what’s there. Instead, we would
like to overﬂow a free raw buﬀer from our bucket, so that we will overﬂow the next pointer in the
block. For this reason, we need to change the order of the ﬁrst two allocations, at least. Reversing
the order of two free blocks can be done by causing two blocks to be allocated and then freed in
the same order. In our hypotetical scenario, block E and D and would be allocated, then block E
: and D would be freed, in the same order. The result of this operation is

Now, our evil allocation will fall in block D and we can overﬂow a free raw buﬀer, just like

we wanted.

This is a nice theoretical experiment. A primitive of this kind still remains to be found.

3.6 The Allocation Primitive

At ﬁrst we tried to cause an allocation of a speciﬁc size by sending IP packets with a corre-
sponding payload size. It turns out that, at least in Digi, packets don’t fall in Q2 regardless
of their payload size. In theory, with some shaping we could overﬂow a block from a diﬀerent
bucket but this would be more complex than needed.

We found that we can achieve allocation for the 0x100 bucket if an ICMP error packet is
generated by the network stack. When a new ICMP error packet is generated (by the function
tfIcmpErrPacket), a call to tfGetSharedBuffer is used to create the new error packet:

Page 18

Ripple20 - © 2020 JSOF Ltd. JSOF

Ripple20

1

packetPtr = tfGetSharedBuffer(0x24,0x4c,0);

This causes an allocation in the correct bucket. The exact calculation is omitted.
One way to generate these error packets in a controllable way is to send a single fragment of
a multi-fragment packet (a fragment with MF=1), but never send the closing fragment (one with
the same identiﬁcation and MF=0), leaving the packet “half-open”, waiting to be abandoned.
This causes the network stack to start a reassembly timer. When this timer times-out and
no closing fragment arrives, an ICMP error packet will be generated with error type “Time
Exceeded” (11) and error code “Fragment reassembly time exceeded” (1).

We can use this primitive to shape the 0x100 bucket list in the following manner:

• Send a few “half-open” fragments, each with a separate identiﬁcation value.

• Wait for the reassembly timer to time-out on all of them. The ﬁrst ICMP error sent is

also the ﬁrst one to be freed.

• Send two half-open fragments. This causes the order of the ﬁrst two raw buﬀers to be

reversed.

• Wait for the reassembly timer to time-out.

This primitive works, but has some drawbacks:

• By default, the maximum size of the fragmented packet queue is 5. This means that we
can only achieve 5 allocations in the Q2 bucket. This number is fairly small, but suﬃcient.

• The initial value for the reassembly timer is 64 seconds, by default. This means that we
need to wait 64 seconds before our allocations take place. This can be a concern, because
in the 64 seconds window, packets can be sent to/from the device, potentially destroying
our shape. Fortunately, we found that 0x100 allocations aren’t so common, so we are
good to go.

3.7 Overwriting the Stack

Previously, we described how to shape the heap layout so that both the overﬂowing raw buﬀer
is of known size (0x100) as well as the free raw buﬀer which lies directly after it. This means
we can deterministicly overwrite the next pointer of the free-list with a pointer on the stack.

In the previous section, we established that the ICMP error packet primitive is good for
shaping the heap. Is it also good for overwriting the stack with data we control? At ﬁrst sight
it seems that the answer is negative - an ICMP error packet is generated by the network stack
to notify an oﬀending host that something went wrong. However, according to [3], the ICMP
error packet also includes the IP header of the oﬀending packet along with an additional 8 bytes
of payload. This information is included in order to let the oﬀending host know what went
wrong.

This allows us to perform a write-what-where, which we will use to write on the stack: we
control the IP payload data, so we can overwrite a location on the stack with 8 bytes. However,
this is insuﬃcient if we want to write meaningful ROP and shellcode. We can improve this
primitive by (ab)using the IP options that are part of the IP header included in the ICMP error
packet.

Recall that the maximum IP header length is 60 bytes (IHL=0xf). This leaves us with an
options ﬁeld of 60-20=40 bytes. The options ﬁeld has a speciﬁc format, so if we simply overload
it with arbitrary binary data, the network stack will reject the packet prematurely. Fortunately,

Page 19

Ripple20

we  can  mark  the  end  of  the  options  ﬁeld  using  a  null  byte  right  at  the  beginning  of  the  ﬁeld.
This  causes  the  network  stack  to  stop  parsing  the  options  ﬁeld,  bypassing  rejection  but  still
including  the  arbitrary  data  in  the  ICMP  error  message.

To  align  our  writes  to  4-byte  boundary,  we  consumed  4  bytes  from  the  options  ﬁeld  and
ﬁlled  them  with  null  bytes.  The  rest  of  the  options  ﬁeld  (36  bytes)  contains  arbitrary  binary
data.  Accounting  also  for  the  8  bytes  copied  from  the  IP  payload,  we  can  overwrite  a  location
on  the  stack  with  44  bytes  of  binary  data.  Not  bad.  We’ll  use  this  space  for  initial  ROP  and
shellcode.

The 44 bytes overwrite will not be suﬃcient for all the ROP and shellcode we will end up
needing, and we want to extend it. We can do this by calling memcpy to copy an additional section
. of ROP/shellcode directly after our existing data
Also, we still need to ﬁnd a suitable location on the stack to overwrite. We can determine the
. stack address in advance since there is no ASLR implemented
We chose to overwrite the stack frame of memcpy (called from tfIcmpErrPacket). A nice
artifact of overwriting the stack frame of memcpy is that we can return directly to memcpy a second
time, extending our payload. In our speciﬁc ﬁrmware, memcpy keeps track of the source buﬀer
pointer using the r1 register which is also used as the src argument when memcpy is called. This
means that when memcpy returns, r1 points exactly to the location from which we stopped
.copying and we thus can extend our usable stack overwrite, by back ROPing into memcpy

The memcpy function returns with the following instruction:

ldmia

sp!, {r0 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 r9 r10 r11 pc}

Since memcpy expects 3 arguments, dst, src and length, in registers r0, r1 and r2, re-
spectively, we need some gadget that will allow us to set the arguments correctly (speciﬁcally,
r2).

We used the following gadget (gadget1):

mov r2, r5; mov lr, pc; bx r7;

and overwrote the stack frame of memcpy with:
In summary, using a large IP payload, we can write a long ROP chain and shellcode, without

restrictions on the data written.

3.8 Executing Shellcode

Our ultimate goal is to run shellcode. In the previous section we dropped the shellcode onto
the stack. Since an XN mitigation is not present in our case, we can simply jump to the stack.

There’s a little caveat when jumping to the shellcode in ARM - cache coherence [4]. ARM
maintains separate data and instruction caches. The result is that when we overwrite the stack,
the shellcode is actually written to the data cache, not to memory. Later when we jump to our
shellcode, the CPU will fetch the instructions directly from memory - executing old data on the
. stack
We need to clear the caches somehow. The easiest way to do it is to call a sleep function (in
our case tx thread sleep) as part of the ROP chain, which will trigger a context switch. After
.executing the sleep function, we jump to our shellcode

The full ROP chain is available in ﬁgure 3.5. The shellcode itself is nothing fancy. We made

a LED blink indeﬁnitely as a proof-of-concept.

3.9 Putting It All Together

To recollect, the exploit consists of three main stages:

1. Shaping: at this stage we send 32 ICMP echo request packets so that enough tsPacket
structures will be allocated in the recycle list. Also, we send 5 “half-open” fragments,
waiting for the reassembly timer to time-out and then send an additional 2 “half-open”
fragments to reverse the order of the ﬁrst two allocations.

2. Overﬂow: at this stage we overﬂow a free raw buﬀer (heap block) from the 0x100 bucket,
so that the next pointer of the free-list points to the stack frame of memcpy. UDP packets
are destined to port 2362 (digiman).

3. Proﬁt: this stage causes three raw buﬀers of size 0x100 to be allocated, using the ICMP
error packet primitive. The last of them is allocated on the stack frame of memcpy, and
contains the ROP chain as well as the shellcode. This is the point where the CPU execution
is controlled.

CVE-2020-11898 Overview

As we’ve already established in 2, the Treck TCP/IP stack does not properly handles incoming
IPv4 fragments over an IP-in-IP tunnel. This could also allow an unauthenticated attacker to
leak memory from the heap.

Recall that in 3.7 we abused the creation of ICMP error packets to achieve write-what-where
primitive. We were able to do it since the IP header of the oﬀending packet plus 8 bytes of IP
payload are copied into the error packet. This behavior can be exploited into an information
leakage vulnerability if tfIcmpErrPacket copies out-of-bound data into the error packet.

Consider the following example:

• Inner IP packet: IPv4{ihl=0xf, len=100, proto=0} with payload ’\x00’*40+’\x41’*100.

• Outer IP packet (fragment 1): IPv4{frag offset=0, MF=1, proto=4, id=0xabcd} with
24 bytes from the inner IP packet payload. This means that 20 bytes of IP header will be
copied, plus 4 null bytes.

• Outer IP packet (fragment 2): IPv4{frag offset=24, MF=0, proto=4, id=0xabcd} with

the rest of the bytes from the inner IP packet as payload.

When the network stack receives the two fragments, it reassembles them using
tfIpReassemblePacket. This function links the two fragments using the ﬁeld pktuLinkNextPtr

in tsUserPacket structure (see 2.3). If tunneling is enabled, the inner IP packet will be pro-
cessed next by the IP layer, in the function tfIpIncomingPacket.

The inner IP packet passes the IP header sanity checks since only the pktuChainDataLength
ﬁeld of tsUserPacket is taken into account (rather than pktuLinkDataLength). Also, the IP
options parsing passes since there are 4 null bytes after the standard IP header (20 bytes), and
a null byte represent the end of options list (see [1]).

If the total length ﬁeld from the IP header of the inner IP packet is strictly less than the chain-
data-length, the network stack will attempt to trim the packet. As described in 2.3, trimming
is obtained by setting both the ﬁelds pktuLinkDataLength and pktuChainDataLength to the
same value, the total length ﬁeld (100 in our example).

Since the inner IP packet contains an invalid IPv4 protocol number (protocol 0), the network
stack will reject the packet by sending an ICMP error message with type 3 (destination un-
reachable) code 2 (protocol unreachable). The function responsible for creating the error packet
is tfIcmpErrPacket. It allocates a new packet, initializes some ICMP ﬁelds, and eventually
copy some data from the oﬀending packet (the inner IP packet).

Let’s look more closely at the copy part:

1

2

3

length = (packetPtr->pktUserStruct).pktuLinkDataLength;
if (headerLengthInBytes + 8 <= length) {
length = headerLengthInBytes + 8;

22

Ripple20 - © 2020 JSOF Ltd. JSOF

Ripple20

4

5

}
memcpy(icmpErrHdrPtr + 8, pktIpHdrPtr, length);

As we can see, tfIcmpErrPacket computes the number of bytes to be copied by taking
the minimum between the IP header length in bytes plus 8 (in our case, 60 + 8 = 68) and
the pktuLinkDataLength ﬁeld, which was trimmed to be 100 in this case. Since the actual
link-data-length of the ﬁrst fragment of the oﬀending packet is 24 (not 100), tfIcmpErrPacket
will copy 68 − 24 = 44 bytes of data leaked from the heap.

This vulnerability can be used to exploit CVE-2020-11896 and other RCE vulnerabilities
when exploit mitigations (like ASLR) are enabled, as well as in cases where a debugger is not
present.

## Treck IP stacks contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#257161

Original Release Date: 2020-06-16 | Last Revised: 2022-09-20

---

### Overview

Treck IP stack implementations for embedded systems are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. This set of vulnerabilities was researched and reported by JSOF, who calls them [Ripple20](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

### Description

Treck IP network stack software is designed for and used in a variety of embedded systems. The software can be licensed and integrated in various ways, including compiled from source, licensed for modification and reuse and finally as a dynamic or static linked library. Treck IP software contains multiple vulnerabilities, most of which are caused by [memory management bugs](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152142). For more details on the vulnerabilities introduced by these bugs, see Treck's  [Vulnerability Response Information](https://treck.com/vulnerability-response-information/) and JSOF's [Ripple20 advisory](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

Historically-related KASAGO TCP/IP middleware from Zuken Elmic (formerly Elmic Systems) is also affected by some of these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities likely affect industrial control systems and medical devices. Please see ICS-CERT Advisory [ICSA-20-168-01](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-168-01) for more information.

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities will vary due to the combination of build and runtime options used while developing different embedded systems. This diversity of implementations and the lack of supply chain visibility has exasperated the problem of accurately assessing the impact of these vulnerabilities. In summary, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to use specially-crafted network packets to cause a denial of service, disclose information, or execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

Update to the latest stable version of Treck IP stack software (6.0.1.67 or later). Please contact Treck at security@treck.com. Downstream users of embedded systems that incorporate Treck IP stacks should contact their embedded system vendor.

#### Block anomalous IP traffic

Consider blocking network attacks via deep packet inspection. In some cases, modern switches, routers, and firewalls will drop malformed packets with no additional configuration. It is recommended that such security features are not disabled. Below is a list of possible mitigations that can be applied as appropriate to your network environment.

* Normalize or reject IP fragmented packets (IP Fragments) if not supported in your environment
* Disable or block IP tunneling, both IPv6-in-IPv4 or IP-in-IP tunneling if not required
* Block IP source routing and any IPv6 deprecated features like routing headers (see also [VU#267289](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/267289))
* Enforce TCP inspection and reject malformed TCP packets
* Block unused ICMP control messages such MTU Update and Address Mask updates
* Normalize DNS through a secure recursive server or application layer firewall
* Ensure that you are using reliable OSI layer 2 equipment (Ethernet)
* Provide DHCP/DHCPv6 security with feature like DHCP snooping
* Disable or block IPv6 multicast if not used in switching infrastructure

Further recommendations are available [here](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/recommendations.md).

#### Detect anomalous IP traffic

Suricata IDS has built-in decoder-event rules that can be customized to detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. See the rule below for an example. A larger set of selected [vu-257161.rules](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/vu-257161.rules) are available from the CERT/CC Github repository.

`#IP-in-IP tunnel with fragments`

`alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"VU#257161:CVE-2020-11896, CVE-2020-11900 Fragments inside IP-in-IP tunnel https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/257161"; ip_proto:4; fragbits:M; sid:1367257161; rev:1;)`

### Acknowledgements

Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman of JSOF https://jsof-tech.com researched and reported these vulnerabilities. Treck worked closely with us and other stakeholders to coordinate the disclosure of these vulnerabilities.

#### Vendor Statement

Green Hills Software LLCâs GHnetâ¢ v2 network stack is based on the network stack from Treck Inc. Treck informed Green Hills Software of multiple vulnerabilities in its network stack, which were found by a third party.

While GHnet v2 is based on Treckâs network stack, the two are not identical. Green Hills Software has made many improvements, added new features, and fixed bugs in the product. Because of these improvements and INTEGRITYâs separation kernel architecture, the impact of these vulnerabilities on GHnet v2 is far less severe.

Green Hills Software has and will continue to advocate for running middleware, driver, and application code in partitioned virtual address spaces, rather than in the kernel. The INTEGRITY Real-Time Operating System was designed to provide isolation between applications and the kernel, protecting the rest of the system if an application fails or misbehaves. Due to the isolation provided by INTEGRITY, running the GHnet v2 stack in a virtual address space significantly reduces the impact of these vulnerabilities. Green Hills Software strongly recommends that the GHnet v2 network stack, all other middleware, and all application code be placed in separate virtual address spaces.

Green Hills Software will include fixes for these vulnerabilities in future releases of GHnet v2, and is making patches available to customers on previous releases. If you have questions about how these vulnerabilities may affect your system, please contact your Green Hills Software sales representative, or contact Green Hills Software Technical Support.

CVE-2020-11901

JSOF Research Lab
Moshe Kol
Ariel Schön
Shlomi Oberman

AUGUST 2020

Abstract

The  JSOF  research  lab  discovered  a  series  of  zero-day  vulnerabilities,  collectively  known  as
Ripple20,  in  a  widely  used  embedded  TCP/IP  stack  called  Treck.

In this paper we go in to the details of CVE-2020-11901, one of the most interesting vulner-

abilities  in  Ripple20.

Behind  the  scenes,  CVE-2020-11901  is  comprised  of  4  diﬀerent  vulnerabilities  located  in
proximity  to  each  other  in  the  code  and  bundled  in  to  one  CVE.  While  every  version  of  Treck
using  the  vulnerable  component  is  aﬀected  by  a  critical  remote  code  execution  vulnerability  of
these  4  (at  the  time  of  disclosure),  some  of  the  vulnerabilities  aﬀect  all  versions  of  Treck,  and
others  aﬀect  only  newer  versions  or  only  older  versions.

Despite  the  fact  that  some  of  these  vulnerabilities  were  ﬁxed  in  the  Treck  stack  over  the
years,  all  of  the  vulnerabilities  existed  “in-the-wild”  at  the  time  of  disclosure,  due  to  some
vendors  using  older  versions  of  the  Treck  TCP/IP  stack  and  dropping  ongoing  support  from
Treck,  and  presumably  also  because  these  vulnerabilities  have  not  been  publicly  recognized  as
security  issues  prior  to  the  JSOF  disclosure.  This  is  just  another  artifact  of  the  complexities
and  intricacies  of  vulnerabilities  in  a  complex  supply  chain.

The  most  severe  of  CVE-2020-11901  are  critical  DNS  client-side  vulnerabilities  located  in
Treck’s  DNS  resolver  component,  which  received  a  CVSSv3.1  score  of  9.1.  If  successfully  ex-
ploited,  they  allow  for  a  pre-authentication  arbitrary  remote  code  execution  in  the  context  of
the  network  stack,  often  the  OS  kernel.  These  vulnerabilities  are  of  particular  interest  because
a sophisticated (e.g.  nation state) attacker can potentially reply to a DNS request from outside
of  the  corporate  network,  thus  breaking  network  segmentation.

In  addition  to  full  details  about  the  vulnerabilities  themselves,  we  will  also  discuss  details

of  exploitation  on  a  Schneider  Electric  UPS  Device.

CVE-2020-11901  Overview

CVE-2020-11901  is  a  single  name  for  several  critical  client-side  vulnerabilities  in  the  DNS  re-
solver  of  the  Treck  TCP/IP  stack.  If  successfully  exploited,  they  allow  remote  code  execution
for  an  unauthenticated  attacker  that  is  able  to  respond  to  a  DNS  query  generated  from  an
aﬀected  device.  The  vulnerabilities  can  potentially  be  exploited  across  network  boundaries,
making  them  extremely  dangerous.

The  vulnerabilities  mostly  stem  from  an  incorrect  DNS  label  length  calculation.  One  vul-
nerability is triggered by specifying small RDLENGTH value, and another leverages DNS message
compression  scheme  in  order  to  achieve  an  integer  overﬂow.

In  this  paper,  we  detail  the  vulnerabilities  and  we  will  explain  an  exploit  on  a  Schneider

Electric  UPS  device.

DNS Protocol Primer

As the vulnerabilities reside in the DNS resolver component of the network stack, we’ll take a
quick look into the DNS protocol.

2.1 The Basics

The domain name system (DNS) is a networking infrastructure protocol that enables TCP/IP
applications to map domain names into IP addresses. The domain name space is hierarchical:
it starts from an unnamed root, branching into top-level domains (TLDs) such as, com, org,
edu, and continues to branch from there. A fully-qualiﬁed domain name (FQDN) represents a
path from a root to a node in the DNS tree, and it is written from right-to-left, starting with
the node and ending with the root. For instance, www.example.com. (note the trailing dot),
represents this path:

.(root)

(cid:47) com

(cid:47) example

(cid:47) www

A TCP/IP application converts a name into an address using a DNS resolver. The resolver
issues a query to one or more conﬁgured DNS servers, requesting information about the domain
in question. Once a DNS response arrives, it is parsed and the information is passed to the
application, and often cached for additional use. Treck TCP/IP has a set of public API functions
for interaction with the DNS resolver, as we will see later.

Information about domains is distributed among name servers. Every name server manages
one or more zones. A zone is a sub-tree of the hierarchical domain name space that is adminis-
trated separately. A zone ﬁle stores information about the zone in records. Each record has a
name, value, type, class and TTL. The interpretation of the record’s value depends on its type
and class.

In practice, the only used class is the internet class IN (1). Common record types within

this class include:

Type

A
AAAA
MX

Description

IPv4 address.
IPv6 address.
Mail exchange record. The Record’s value is a tuple of preference value and a
domain name of a host capable of accepting emails.

CNAME Used to deﬁne aliases.
NS

Speciﬁes an authoritative name server for the domain. The record’s Value is a
domain name.

MX  Records  Because  some  of  the  code  presented  later  in  the  paper  concerns  MX  records,
we  will  elaborate  more  about  them.  MX  (Mail  eXchange)  records  are  an  essential  part  of  the
way emails work.  When sending an email using the familiar user@host notation, the mail client
issues a DNS query of type MX to resolve host.  As an answer, the DNS server returns a domain
name  of  a  mail  server  (also  called  “MX  hostname”).  Each  MX  hostname  is  associated  with  a
16-bit  integer  called  preference  value  used  to  prioritize  hostnames.  A  smaller  preference  value
has  a  higher  priority.

Since a domain name of the mail server is returned (rather than an IP address), the client’s
resolver  needs  to  further  resolve  the  MX  hostname  with  a  second  request  in  an  order  to  get
an  IP  address.  To reduce  latency,  most  DNS  servers  hand-in  the  IP  address  along  with  name.
Nonetheless,  this  “double-query”  functionality  should  be  supported  by  the  resolver.

2.2  DNS  Packet  Format

DNS messages are generally transmitted over UDP 1. The high level structure of a DNS message
is  shown  in  ﬁgure  2.1.  A  DNS  message  (query  or  response)  has  has  a  ﬁxed-length  header  of  12
bytes,  followed  by  4  variable-length  sections.

The DNS header format is shown in ﬁgure 2.2.  The transaction ID is a 16-bit ﬁeld set by the
resolver  (client)  to  match  the  response  with  the  query.  The  QR  ﬁeld  is  a  bit  specifying  whether
the  packet  is  a  query  (QR=0)  or  response  (QR=1).  RCODE  holds  the  response  code,  where  a  non-
zero  value  indicates  an  erroneous  conditions.  The  QDCOUNT,  ANCOUNT,  NSCOUNT  and  ARCOUNT
specify  the  number  of  entries  in  each  of  the  4  sections  following  the  header,  respectively.

Figure 2.3: Question section format

Figure 2.4: DNS resource record format

Each  entry  of  the  questions  section,  referred  to  as  “question”,  has  a  speciﬁc  format,  shown
in  ﬁgure  2.3.  The  query  name  ﬁeld  speciﬁes  the  name  being  looked  up.  It  follows  a  speciﬁc
format we will describe later.  The client speciﬁes the type of the record of interest in the query
type  ﬁeld.

The  entries  of  answers,  authority  and  additional  sections  are  called  resource  records.  These
records  will  be  major  player  in  our  vulnerabilities.  The  format  is  depicted  in  ﬁgure  2.4.  Each
resource-record  is  associated  with  a  NAME,  to  which  the  record  refers,  as  well  as  with  a  TYPE
and a CLASS. The TTL (time-to-live) ﬁeld speciﬁes the number of seconds the resource record is
allowed  to  be  cached  by  the  client.  The  RDATA  ﬁeld  contains  the  record’s  value.  Its  length  is
speciﬁed  in  the  RDLENGTH  ﬁeld.

2.3  Domain  Names  Format  and  Message  Compression

Last but not least, the binary format of a name.  The format is speciﬁed in [2, sections 3.1, 4.1.4],
and  it  is  relatively  simple.  A  domain  name  is  a  sequence  of  labels,  terminated  by  the  empty
label.  Each label is preceded by a length byte.  The maximum label length is 63 bytes, and the
empty  label  has  length  0.  As  an  example,  we  will  encode  the  domain  name  www.example.com:

Figure 2.5: Domain name encoding

The conversion from the binary format to the ASCII format is straight-forward:  replace all

length  bytes  with  dots  (.)  except  the  ﬁrst  and  the  last.

A  typical  DNS  response  includes  the  same  domain  name  or  a  part  of  it  several  times.
Consider a query of type A for the domain name www.example.com.  Some DNS servers include
www.example.com  two  times  in  their  response:

0010
0020

domains that have multiple A or CNAME records (you can try resolving www.youtube.com by
yourselves).

To reduce the size of DNS messages, a compression scheme can be used.

In the scheme
taken by the designers of DNS, compression is achieved by replacing a sequence of labels with
a pointer to a previous occurrence of the same sequence. The pointer is encoded in two bytes,
the ﬁrst of them begins with two high bits 11, and the other 14 bits specify an oﬀset from the
start of the DNS header.

Figure 2.7: Compression pointer format

To  illustrate  the  concept,  suppose  that  at  oﬀset  0x10  from  the  start  of  a  DNS  response

packet  there  is  a  sequence  of  labels  corresponding  to  example.com:

Figure 2.8: Domain name encoding of example.com

In  order  to  encode,  for  example,  the  domain  name  x.y.z.example.com,  we  can  encode  it
directly or utilize the compression scheme.  In the latter case, the encoded domain name would
look  like  this:

Figure 2.9: Encoding of x.y.z.example.com using compression

This  instructs  the  DNS  server  or  client  to  concatenate  the  sequence  of  labels  beginning  at
oﬀset  0x10  to  the  sequence  x.y.z..  The  expanded  domain  name  is  x.y.z.example.com,  as
expected.

Returning  to  the  example  of  resolving  www.example.com,  let’s  look  at  a  real  world  case.

This  is  part  of  a  response  from  Google’s  8.8.8.8  DNS  server,  which  uses  compression:

 Figure 2.10: DNS response packet in which compression is used for the second occurrence of
www.example.com

As  you  can  see,  the  name  of  answer  resource  record  is  replaced  by  a  pointer  to  oﬀset  0xc,

which  is  the  start  of  the  www.example.com  domain  name.

The Vulnerabilities

In this section we will explain the vulnerabilities known as CVE-2020-11901.

3.1 Treck’s DNS Resolver Internals

A TCP/IP application running on top of the Treck TCP/IP stack interacts with the DNS
resolver using high-level APIs such as tfDnsGetHostByName and tfDnsGetMailHost. When
a request is made using these functions, a tsDnsCacheEntry structure is created in order to
record some information about it (a new cache entry is not created if a cache-entry describing
the request is already present). Some of tsDnsCacheEntry ﬁelds are shown below:

typedef struct tsDnsCacheEntry {

TM_FAR * dnscAddrInfoPtr;

struct tsDnsCacheEntry TM_FAR * dnscNextEntryPtr;
struct tsDnsCacheEntry TM_FAR * dnscPrevEntryPtr;
// Pointer to chain of address information structures.
struct addrinfo
// ...
// String used in DNS query packet (in DNS label format)
ttCharPtr
// Error code (if any) returned from socket of DNS server
int
// ...
// Indicates if this entry is completed and has been retrieved by the user
tt16Bit
dnscFlags;
// ...
// ID of the last request sent that was associated with this cache entry
tt16Bit
// Query type (Name, MX, reverse)
tt16Bit

dnscRequestStr;

dnscQueryType;

dnscRequestId;

dnscErrorCode;

};

tsDnsCacheEntry structures are stored in a doubly-linked list. They hold information about
the DNS request being made, such as the request string (dnscRequestStr), the transaction ID
(dnscRequestId) and the query type of the request (A, AAAA, MX, . . . ) with dnscQueryType.
This struct also holds information about the response, most notably using a chain of address
information structures (pointed to by dnscAddrInfoPtr).

An addrinfo is a small structure containing the following ﬁelds:

struct addrinfo {

int
int
int
int
unsigned int

ai_flags; // AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, AI_NUMERICHOST
ai_family; // PF_INET, PF_INET6
ai_socktype; // SOCK_xxx (not used)
ai_protocol; // 0 or IPPROTO_xxx (not used)
ai_addrlen; // length of ai_addr

#define ai_mxpref ai_addrlen

char TM_FAR *

ai_canonname; // canonical name for nodename

#define ai_mxhostname ai_canonname

struct sockaddr TM_FAR * ai_addr; // binary address
struct addrinfo TM_FAR * ai_next; // next structure in linked list

};

An addrinfo structure holds information about addresses returned by the DNS server. The
exact information it holds depends on the query type. When the query type is A or AAAA
(requesting IP address for a name), this structure holds IP address information (ai addr) along
with a canonical name (ai canonname), if supplied at the response. If the query type is MX
(mail exchange), the MX preference value is stored in place of ai addrlen and the MX hostname
is store in place of ai canonname.

3.2 Parsing DNS Responses

Treck’s DNS resolver processes incoming DNS responses in a function called tfDnsCallback.
This function accepts tsDnsCacheEntry structure as argument and is responsible for parsing a
DNS response message and caching information about the queried name.

During the parsing of the ANSWERS section from the DNS response packet, the code
allocates an addrinfo and stores relevant information in it. Let us take a closer look at the
piece of (pseudo-)code parsing MX records:

if (RDLENGTH <= remaining_size) {

/* compute the next resource record pointer based on the RDLENGTH */
labelEndPtr = resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 10 + RDLENGTH;
/* type: MX */
if (cacheEntryQueryType == DNS_TYPE_MX && rrtype == DNS_TYPE_MX) {

addr_info = tfDnsAllocAddrInfo();
if (addr_info != NULL && RDLENGTH >= 2) {

/* copy preference value of MX record */
memcpy(&addr_info->ai_mxpref,resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 10, 2);
/* compute the length of the MX hostname */
labelLength = tfDnsExpLabelLength(resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 0xc, dnsHeaderPtr,
(cid:44)→
addr_info->ai_mxhostname = NULL;
if (labelLength != 0) {

labelEndPtr);

/* allocate buffer for the expanded name */
asciiPtr = tfGetRawBuffer((uint)labelLength);
addr_info->ai_mxhostname = asciiPtr;
if (asciiPtr != NULL) {

/* copy MX hostname to `asciiPtr` as ASCII */
tfDnsLabelToAscii(resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 0xc, asciiPtr,
(cid:44)→
/* ... */

dnsHeaderPtr, 1, 0);

}
/* ... */

}
/* ... */

}
/* ... */

}

}

As we can see, the resolver performs the following steps to handle incoming MX answers:

1. Allocate a new addrinfo struct.

2. Store the MX preference value in the ai mxpref ﬁeld.

Ripple20 c(cid:13) 2020 JSOF Ltd.

Technical White Paper

3. Compute the length of the MX hostname using tfDnsExpLabelLength.

4. Allocate a new buﬀer based on the returned length labelLength.

5. Convert the raw MX hostname to ASCII using tfDnsLabelToAscii, and store the result

into the newly allocated buﬀer asciiPtr.

Notice that tfDnsLabelToAscii is not aware of the size of the allocated buﬀer asciiPtr.
The tfDnsLabelToAscii function will copy only alphanumeric and ‘-’ characters to the des-
tination buﬀer, until non-alphanumeric or non-hyphen character is reached. Furthermore, if
the 4th and 5th arguments passed to it are 1, 0 respectively, tfDnsLabelToAscii function will
honor the DNS compression scheme. We can see from the code that if the length returned
by tfDnsExpLabelLength is too small, tfDnsLabelToAscii will overﬂow the allocated buﬀer,
with an alphanumeric overwrite only.

At this stage we will investigate the length calculation function tfDnsExpLabelLength in

depth.

3.3 DNS Label Length Calculation

Below is a pseudo-code for tfDnsExpLabelLength:

tt16Bit tfDnsExpLabelLength(tt8BitPtr labelPtr, tt8BitPtr pktDataPtr, tt8BitPtr labelEndPtr){

tt8Bit currLabelLength;
tt16Bit i = 0, totalLength = 0;
tt8BitPtr newLabelPtr;

while (&labelPtr[i] < labelEndPtr && labelPtr[i] != 0) {

currLabelLength = labelPtr[i];
if ((currLabelLength & 0xc0) == 0) {

totalLength += currLabelLength + 1;
i += currLabelLength + 1;

} else {

if (&labelPtr[i+1] < labelEndPtr) {

newLabelPtr = pktDataPtr + (((currLabelLength & 0x3f) << 8) | labelPtr[i+1]);
if (newLabelPtr < labelPtr) {

labelPtr = newLabelPtr;
i = 0;
continue;

}

}
return 0;

}

}
return totalLength;

}

tfDnsExpLabelLength calculates the length of the DNS label pointed to by labelPtr. It’s
basic operation is to sum-up all length bytes of the given label (domain name), while honoring
compression pointers. It accepts a pointer to the start of the packet data buﬀer in pktDataPtr
and an end-pointer in labelEndPtr. Using the end-pointer, the function ensures that out-of-
bound data is not read. The pointer to the start of the packet data buﬀer, pktDataPtr, is
necessary to support the DNS compression scheme described earlier.

The function maintains the total label length in the totalLength variable.

It continues
to read the current label length (currLabelLength) as long as it is greater than 0.
If the
current label length ≤ 63, it is added to the totalLength variable. Otherwise, it means
that a compression pointer follows (one of the higher two bits is set). The function reads
the compression pointer and computes the new label pointer in newLabelPtr. Then, it veriﬁes

that the new label pointer points before the current label pointer. If this is the case, the length
of the new label pointed to by the compression pointer, is computed in the same way, and added
to totalLength.

There are several issues with this implementation:

1. The type of the totalLength variable is tt16Bit (typedef for unsigned short). If pos-
sible, overﬂowing the totalLength variable would result in a small number returned by
tfDnsExpLabelLength. A buﬀer would then be allocated based on that number, and the
buﬀer could be overﬂown by tfDnsLabelToAscii.

2. It does not honor the 255 maximum domain name length as speciﬁed in [2].

3. It does not validate the characters used in the domain name itself: they should be al-

phanumeric and ‘-’ only.

4. It treats label lengths with most-signiﬁcant-bits 01 and 10 as if they specify compression
pointer. According to [2], only two high bits 11 should specify compression, and the
other cases are reserved for future use. This behavior could come handy in some cases, as
0x4130 for example is a valid compression pointer and also contains valid alpha-numeric
characters.

In addition, notice that the function stops processing when &labelPtr[i] reaches the

totalLength value.

3.4 Vulnerability #1: Bad RDLENGTH Leads to Heap Overﬂow

Recall that in the section 3.2 we discussed the handling of MX resource records. An end-pointer
is passed to the tfDnsExpLabelLength and is calculated based on the RDLENGTH ﬁeld:

1

labelEndPtr = resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 10 + RDLENGTH;

The RDLENGTH is a 16-bit ﬁeld part of the resource record (recall section 2.2). This ﬁeld
speciﬁes the number of bytes of the RDATA ﬁeld, and it is attacker-controlled. An attacker can
specify a small RDLENGTH value, causing the length calculation to stop prematurely. This results
in tfDnsExpLabelLength returning small length number. As explained earlier, this leads to
heap-based buﬀer overﬂow vulnerability. This vulnerability only exists in newer versions of the
Treck TCP/IP stack, and aﬀects the latest version at the time of disclosure. We do not know
the exact version when this vulnerability was introduced.

3.5 Vulnerability #2: From Integer Overﬂow to Heap Overﬂow

Treck’s resolver accepts DNS response packets over UDP with a size of up to (≤) 0x5b4 (1460).
As explained earlier, the total label length maintained by tfDnsExpLabelLength is of type
unsigned short (16-bit width). So we can now ask: is it possible to encode a domain name
within a single DNS response packet so that the domain name length is expanded (as calculated
by tfDnsExpLabelLength) to 65536 (216) or more?

To achieve this kind of length ampliﬁcation over UDP1, we certainly must use the compres-
sion feature of DNS. Keep in mind that with a compression pointer we can only jump backwards
from our current label pointer (see section 3.3), making the task more challenging.

1At least in the versions of Treck at our disposal, DNS over TCP is not supported. Had it been supported,

our task would have been much easier because DNS over TCP allows large packet sizes of up to 65536 bytes.

Technical White Paper

Since tfDnsExpLabelLength does not enforce the validity of characters in a label, we can
overload the bytes of a label with useful information. “Overload” in this context means that
bytes normally part of the label contents have an extra role in which they are interpreted as
length bytes or compression pointers under diﬀerent circumstances.

The Basic Technique The following example introduces the basic technique we used in our
proof-of-concept. Consider the encoded name shown in ﬁgure 3.1.

 Figure 3.1: Tiny example of using compression pointers. Cells with * can be ﬁlled with any byte
value

The  technique  is  easier  to  understand  if  we  think  about  the  encoded  name  as  a  matrix.  In
this  tiny  example,  each  row  has  size  of  16  bytes.  This  number  was  chosen  so  that  it  will  be
easier  to  follow.

Suppose  that  the  calculation  of  the  name’s  length  starts  at  oﬀset  0xf,  the  last  byte  of  the
ﬁrst  row.  This  can  be  achieved  by  placing  the  name  somewhere  in  the  DNS  response  and  then
refer  back  to  it  using  a  compression  pointer  (more  about  this  below).  With  this  assumption,
tfDnsExpLabelLength  would  read  a  label  length  byte  of  0x0f,  and  advance  the  input  head  to
the  last  byte  of  the  second  row  (staying  on  the  same  column).  Then  it  reads  a  label  length  of
0x0e and advance the input head to the second-to-last byte of third row (oﬀset 0xe of the third
row).  At  this  point  it  reads  a  compression  pointer.  The  pointer  oﬀset  is  0xe  which  is  strictly
less  than  our  starting  point  (at  oﬀset  0xf),  so  the  process  repeats  from  oﬀset  0xe.  The  next
compression read is to oﬀset 0xd, and so on.  The length calculation stops when it reaches oﬀset
0x07,  because  we  placed  a  null-byte  there  in  this  example.

Of  course  we  can  add  more  rows  between  the  starting  point  and  the  part  of  the  branch

bytes.  In  ﬁgure  3.2  we  demonstrate  the  addition  of  5  extra  rows.

Technical White Paper

The extra rows we added have no particular role except extending the name as much as
possible. To make the explanation easy for the rest of the section, we shall introduce some
deﬁnitions. A lane is a column in this matrix, terminated by a branch byte. A branch byte
routes the lane to the appropriate compression pointer - paving the way for the next lane.

In the previous example we used 8 lanes. We can improve this situation by including more
compression pointers at the second-to-last row and more branches at the third-to-last row.
Building on that idea, we reach the following:

Figure 3.3: Full illustration of the basic technique

Now we use all of the 16 lanes at our disposal.  At the last row we have 8 compression pointers
and  so  8  branch  bytes  at  the  second-to-last  row.  This  leaves  us  with  another  4  compression
pointers  to  be  used  at  the  second-to-last  row.  These  compression  pointers  are  reached  by  the
branch  bytes  at  the  third-to-last  row  (oﬀsets  4-7),  which  leaves  us  with  a  place  for  another
2  compression  pointers,  and  so  on.  The  last  lane  (which  begins  in  the  ﬁrst  row  oﬀset  0),  is
terminated  with  a  null  byte  (at  oﬀset  0  of  the  forth  row).

By using this construction, in this example, we reached a total length of 1502.  This is pretty

neat  if  you  consider  the  fact  that  the  name  itself  only  occupies  128  bytes.

Proof-of-Concept
In  the  simple  example  presented  above  we  did  not  reach  a  state  where
the totalLength variable is overﬂowed.  However, we are not far from it.  We have two tools we
can  use  to  maximize  the  total  length:

1. Maximize the size of a row in the matrix. Because the maximum length byte allowed is

63 (=0x3f), we can use rows which are up to 64 bytes in length.

2. Pad lanes with more extra rows.

We used these two tools to maximize the total length. With 64 lanes, this construction

overﬂows the 16-bit totalLength variable in tfDnsExpLabelLength.

We are almost done. Until now, we hid some information under the rug:

1. Where this “long name” is placed in the DNS packet.

2. How we begin the length calculation from a speciﬁc spot in this long name.

3. How we overﬂow, if tfDnsLabelToAscii only copies alphanumeric characters in to the

buﬀer, but our matrix is comprised of non-alphanumeric characters.

Ripple20 c(cid:13) 2020 JSOF Ltd.

Technical White Paper

The answer to all of these is in how we constructed the packet. A DNS packet can have
multiple questions, so we added another question, the name of which is our matrix construction.
The MX hostname then consists of a label consisting of a chosen alpha-numeric payload followed
by a single compression pointer that will land us exactly on the required starting byte.

The result is heap-based buﬀer overﬂow vulnerability: due to the integer overﬂow, tfDns-
ExpLabelLength returns a labelLength of small size. Based on this size, a buﬀer is allocated
on the heap. tfDnsLabelToAscii is then asked to copy the encoded name as ASCII, overﬂowing
the buﬀer just-allocated with the payload at the beginning of the MX hostname.

This vulnerability aﬀects the latest Treck version at the time of disclosure (version 6.0.1.6).

3.6 Vulnerability #3: Read Out-of-Bounds

In older versions of Treck, there was a read OOB vulnerability during name parsing. The
following snippet of pseudo-code shows the MX parsing logic as it was in older versions:

if (cacheEntryQueryType == DNS_TYPE_MX && rrtype == DNS_TYPE_MX) {

addr_info = tfDnsAllocAddrInfo();
if (addr_info != NULL) {

/* copy preference value of MX record */
memcpy(&addr_info->ai_mxpref, resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 10, 2);
/* compute the length of the MX hostname */
labelLength = tfDnsExpLabelLength(resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 0xc, pktDataPtr);
addr_info->ai_mxhostname = NULL;
if (labelLength != 0) {

/* allocate buffer for the expanded name */
asciiPtr = tfGetRawBuffer(labelLength);
addr_info->ai_mxhostname = asciiPtr;
if (asciiPtr != NULL) {

/* copy MX hostname to `asciiPtr` as ASCII */
tfDnsLabelToAscii(resourceRecordAfterNamePtr + 0xc, asciiPtr, pktDataPtr);
/* ... */

}

/* ... */

In this older version, we can see that there are no checks on the packet buﬀer. In particular,
there’s no end-pointer being calculated and passed to tfDnsExpLabelLength. In this version,
tfDnsExpLabelLength have the exact same operation as explained in section 3.3, except that
it doesn’t have bounds check. Instead, it will iterate over the length bytes until a null-byte is
reached, possibly crossing buﬀer bounds.

This issue could result in a denial-of-service vulnerability, if, for instance, the function reads

from an unmapped page while iterating over the length bytes.

More interestingly, the issue could result in an information leakage vulnerability: tfDns-
LabelToAscii has no bounds check either, so it could copy OOB bytes into the destination
buﬀer. This means that when parsing MX responses, data from the heap could be interpreted
as an MX hostname. The MX hostname just read is later resolved by the client in an attempt to
get an IP address (see paragraph about MX records in 2.1). The result is that it is potentially
possible to leak data from the heap as part of the MX hostname being resolved.

The issue aﬀects Treck versions at least 4.7, and was ﬁxed in later versions2. We don’t
know the exact version in which Treck ﬁxed the issue. Suﬃce to say that the vulnerability still
impacts devices in-the-wild: Some vendors stop updating the Treck stack, yet they continue to
ship their products to other vendors in the supply chain. The unfortunate result is that there
are embedded devices that contain an older version of Treck, and are thus vulnerable to this
issue.

2the ﬁx for the read OOB was a bad ﬁx and caused the bad RDLENGTH vulnerability, described in section 3.4.

3.7 Vulnerability #4: Predictable Transaction ID

Another vulnerability, only seen in earlier versions of the network stack, is that the DNS trans-
action ID is incremented serially, and starts at 0, making it easily guessable. This means that
the attacker might not need to execute complex man-in-the-middle attack in order to ﬁnd the
value of the transaction ID. This ﬂaw makes our DNS exploits easier and can lead to other
consequences. Despite being ﬁxed over the years in the Treck TCP/IP stack it still exists in
devices in the wild, in cases where companies stopped support for the Treck stack or other cases.

3.8 Closing Remarks

In this chapter, we have demonstrated a heap-based buﬀer overﬂow in the DNS resolver code
using two diﬀerent techniques: bad RDLENGTH and integer overﬂow. The function responsible
for the copy (tfDnsLabelToAscii) will only copy alphanumeric and ‘-’ (hyphen) characters to
the destination buﬀer, until non-alphanum or non-hypen character is reached. This means that
we have alphanumeric overwrite, and that we can stop overﬂowing at our will using an invalid
character. In the next chapter we will see how we leveraged this primitive into a remote code
execution.

The two heap overﬂow vulnerabilities (and the read OOB) were demonstrated in the parsing
logic of the MX type. However, the same vulnerabilities are present also during the processing
of CNAME resource records and PTR resource records. Considering the fact that CNAME
records are supported by the DNS resolver no matter what the original query type was, this
means we can cause heap-based buﬀer overﬂow with every type of DNS query generated by an
aﬀected device.

The two heap overﬂow vulnerabilities aﬀect the latest Treck version at the time of disclosure
(version 6.0.1.66). The read out-of-bounds and predictable transaction ID vulnerabilities were
ﬁxed in later versions of the network stack, we don’t know the exact version.

Exploiting  CVE-2020-11901  on  a
Schneider  Electric  UPS  Device

In this part we will show how we exploited CVE-2020-11901 on a Schneider Electric UPS device
and  achieved  remote  code  execution.  The  speciﬁc  model  we  used  is  an  APC  Smart-UPS  750
(SMT750I/ID18/230V)  running  ﬁrmware  v09.3  together  with  a  Network  Management  Card
(NMC) version 2 (model AP9630) running AOS version v6.8.2 (latest at the time of disclosure).
A  UPS  (Uninterruptible  Power  Supply)  device  is  designed  for  use  in  enterprise  networks,
data centers, and mission-critical systems.  It ensures,  using an embedded battery, that devices
connected  to  it  will  not  suﬀer  from  power  outages  or  ﬂuctuations.  As  such,  exploiting  a  UPS
device  remotely,  can  have  disastrous  consequences.

Many  of  the  UPS  devices  manufactured  by  Schneider  Electric  can  be  connected  to  an  IP
network via a network card called NMC. The NMC runs on an x86-based processor and it runs
the  Treck  TCP/IP  as  its  network  stack.  However,  this  processor  implements  segmentation  in
a  unique  manner:  instead  of  calculating  a  linear  address  by  shifting  the  segment  left  by  4-bits
like  most  x86-based  architectures,  it  shifts  the  segment  left  by  8-bits.  The  operating  system,
network  stack,  and  APC  application  all  run  in  16-bit  real  mode.

Having only a single device at the beginning of our research, and worried about ruining the
device,  we  decided  to  attempt  research  and  exploit  development  on  the  device  without  JTAG
or  other  debug  capabilities.  Our  main  sources  of  information  were  static  analysis,  and  crash
dumps  containing  a  small  stack  trace  and  some  register  values.

Our  proof-of-concept  exploit  uses  the  bad  RDLENGTH  vulnerability  to  run  a  shellcode  which
shuts  down  all  UPS  outlets,  turning  oﬀ  any  device  relying  on  it  for  its  operation.  We  will  now
describe  our  exploit  -  the  primitives  established  and  the  techniques  used.  The  exploit  should
be easily adaptable to devices using a vulnerable version of the Treck stack with the same heap
conﬁguration.

4.1  Exploit  Strategy

When  it  comes  to  exploiting  heap  overﬂow  vulnerabilities,  there  are  generally  two  routes:

• Overwrite heap meta-data information.

• Overwrite application-speciﬁc data structures.

The former is usually considered more generic, as it does not require overﬂowing any speciﬁc

data structures, only memory blocks, possibly of a speciﬁc size.

In the previous white paper we detailed exploitation of CVE-2020-11896 [3], where we chose
to exploit the device by corrupting heap metadata. We will now examine the Treck heap

implementation present on the UPS device to determine if this is a suitable plan in this case as
well.

4.2 Treck Sheap (Simple Heap) Internals

Treck uses a proprietary, highly conﬁgurable heap implementation. In this speciﬁc conﬁguration,
the heap is diﬀerent from the heap described in [3].

During device boot, the heap is created statically in a hard-coded address, initially comprised
of 4 free blocks, each 0xAF00 bytes in size. The heap features two bins, each comprised of a
free-list: one for “small” blocks under 0x400 bytes, and one for larger blocks. Free-list blocks
are saved in a singly linked list, where each block contains a “next” pointer and its size in
dwords. The size is saved both at the beginning (preﬁx) and the end of the block (postﬁx).
Allocated blocks contain preﬁx and postﬁx size ﬁelds as well.

4.2.1 malloc()

The entry point for allocation in the Treck heap is tm kernel single malloc. This is the low-
level heap function invoked by more abstract allocation functions such as tfGetRawBuffer for
data buﬀers and tfGetShareBuffer for packets. tm kernel single malloc receives a single
size argument. Internally, the function will call tfSheapGetFreeListBlock which will iterate
the free-list bins. If the requested size ﬁts the small free-list bin (size <= 0x400), it will try
to allocate from that bin ﬁrst, resorting to the big bin if no small block was found.

Figure 4.1: Free list illustration

The  function  tfSheapGetFreeListBlock  is  responsible  for  selecting  a  free  block  and  will
iterate  over  the  entire  free-list.  For  every  block  it  will  check  if  the  preﬁx  and  postﬁx  size  ﬁelds
match  by  adding  the  preﬁx  size  to  its  base  pointer  and  reading  the  postﬁx  size  ﬁeld  from  the
resulting  address.  It  will  do  this  for  every  block  in  the  list,  regardless  of  whether  the  block
is  allocated  and  returned  to  the  caller.  If  the  sizes  are  not  equal,  an  assert  will  fail  and  the
machine  will  crash.  Assuming  everything  went  well,  the  tightest  ﬁtting  block  for  the  requested
size  will be  returned.  tm  kernel  single  malloc  will  then check if  the  returned  block  is  bigger
than the requested allocation size - if so, it will use only as much memory as it requires, making
a  new  free  block  out  of  the  remaining  memory.

4.2.2

free()

The  entry  point  for  freeing  memory  in  the  Treck  heap  is  tm  kernel  free.  It  accepts  a  pointer
to  an  allocated  buﬀer  and  does  the  following  actions:

1. Make sure preﬁx and postﬁx sizes for the allocated block are valid.

2. Iterate both free-list bins:

16

Technical White Paper

(a) For each free block, make sure preﬁx and postﬁx sizes are valid.

(b) If neighboring free blocks are found, coalesce them into one free block.

3. Make sure the current freed size isn’t larger than the total allocated data (global variable).

4. Add the new free block into the correct free-list bin.

4.2.3 Summary

Since the vulnerability allows us to overﬂow a heap buﬀer only with alpha-numerical data, it
can prove hard to corrupt heap metadata in a way that will not cause a system crash1: The
size ﬁeld is 4 bytes long, and the smallest value2 we can write is 0x30303030, a large number,
making it hard for us to fake a postﬁx size that will pass validation3. We can overwrite an
allocated block without worrying about unexpected crashes only until that block itself is freed,
at which point an error ﬂow will be triggered including an assert failure and a device crash.

Because of the checks implemented in this heap conﬁguration, we decided to exploit the
device by overwriting application-speciﬁc data structures allocated on the heap rather than the
heap metadata itself.

4.3 Exploitation Technique

The DNS name parsing vulnerabilities exist in all types of queries, either through the use of a
CNAME record (which is always allowed) or though name ﬁelds in MX or PTR records. The
attack surface we chose is the MX response parsing logic, for a few reasons.

First, when the device boots with a mail recipient conﬁgured, it will send out 3 MX requests
by default before giving up. Because we chose to overﬂow application-speciﬁc data structures,
we need to shape the heap so that we overﬂow our desired data structure. Shaping is more
straight forward with multiple DNS request-response pairs. On top of that, since we don’t have
any debug interfaces, it is useful crash the device anyway to get it into a relatively deterministic
device state. Therefore, the attack scenario chosen is to cause a crash by overﬂowing the heap
with garbage upon any DNS request. After the device reboots in a clean state and starts sending
MX requests, we will execute our exploit logic.

4.3.1 Target Data Structure

During DNS response parsing all sorts of data structures are allocated, including the previously
mentioned tsDnsCacheEntry and addrinfo structures , among others. We chose tsDnsCache-
Entry as our overﬂow target.

Especially interesting is the parsing of the CNAME answer record: the record parsing loop
saves pointers to the CNAME record and returns to parse it after all other answer records were
parsed. Unlike other names where a new addrinfo struct is allocated, CNAME records are
parsed as follows:

// ...
unsigned short length;
addrinfo far * first_addr_info;
char far * cname_label_buffer = 0;

if (found_cname) {

// Get the first addr info from `tsDnsCacheEntry`
first_addr_info = t_dns_cache_entry.dnscAddrInfoPtr;
if (first_addr_info != NULL) {

// get CNAME name length from the packet (the usual vulnerabilities here...)
length = tfDnsExpLabelLength(cname_rdata_ptr, packet_ptr, cname_rdata_end_ptr);
if (length != 0) {

// allocate
cname_label_buffer = tfGetRawBuffer(length);
if (cname_label_buffer != NULL) {

// copy to new buffer
tfDnsLabelToAscii(cname_rdata_ptr, cname_label_buffer, packet_ptr, 1, 0);
first_addr_info.ai_canonname = cname_label_buffer;

}

}

}

}

CNAME record names don’t get a new addrinfo, but are placed in the ﬁrst one pointed to by
tsDnsCacheEntry. Therefore, if we manage to overﬂow tsDnsCacheEntry->dnscAddrInfoPtr,
we can cause writing of a dword to a location of our choosing (as long as the address is alphanu-
merical, like our overﬂow); The dword written will be a pointer to a newly allocated buﬀer
containing our CNAME. This is a strong exploitation primitive, and thus the one we ended up
using.

4.4 Heap Shaping

By shaping the heap using the two allocation primitives speciﬁed later, we managed to overﬂow
the tsDnsCacheEntry struct without corrupting any free blocks. It is worth noting that in the
case of this UPS device, failure to shape the heap will most likely cause the network card to
crash, which has no noticeable eﬀect on UPS operation. The network card reboots quickly and
automatically, allowing several additional exploitation attempts 4.

In our PoC exploit, we initiated a TCP handshake through an open port to allow easier
shaping. This is not necessary, as the ﬁrst 2 MX packets can be crafted to do the entire shaping
job, as shown below.

4.4.1 Target Shape

In order to overwrite this struct, the overﬂowing MX record needs to be allocated before the ts-
DnsCacheEntry struct. Chronologically, the cache entry is allocated on DNS request generation,
before the MX record name buﬀer. Luckily, this heap is sophisticated enough to favor tightest-
ﬁt for allocations. This means we can create a pattern will result in allocations in the correct
order for exploitation. A tsDnsCacheEntry allocation is 0xA0 bytes large, and we control our
MX record size completely. The pattern that would ﬁt our needs is shown in ﬁgure 4.4.1. The
blocks labeled “allocated” are required to prevent free block coalescing and act as separators.

4.4.2 Temporary Allocation Primitive

The “best” allocation primitive in the DNS parsing code is name buﬀer allocation. For every
answer (MX, PTR, CNAME) that has a DNS name in its RDATA ﬁeld, tfGetRawBuffer is
used to allocate a buﬀer for that name. It is important to note that along with this buﬀer,
an addrinfo struct of size 0x38 bytes is also allocated. This primitive allows us to allocate a

approximately 15 minutes of down time for the network card.

buﬀer of any size with arbitrary alpha-numerical contents, along with a less-controlled addrinfo
struct.

However,  this  allocation  primitive  alone  is  not  suﬃcient  as  every  allocated  addrinfo  and
the  name  buﬀers  associated  with  it  are  freed  after  DNS  parsing  fails.  If  DNS  parsing  doesn’t
fail,  no  further  MX  requests  will  be  sent,  preventing  us  from  sending  more  responses.  In  order
to  create  holes  of  arbitrary  size,  we  need  both  an  allocation  primitive  that  will  get  freed  (the
hole)  and  another  allocation  that  won’t,  preventing  coalescing.

4.4.3  Persistent  Allocation  Primitive  (or:  Poking  Holes)

To put allocated “seperators” between our newly created holes, we need an allocation that won’t
get  freed  between  diﬀerent  DNS  request-response  pairs.  A  memory  leak  in  the  DNS  parsing
loop  comes  to  the  rescue.  For  most  record  types,  parsing  begins  like  this:

// First, check if the type fits for A resource records
if (t_dns_cache_entry.dnscQueryType == DNS_TYPE_A && answer_rr_dns.type == DNS_TYPE_A) {

// Make sure RDLENGTH is sane for this type - for A records, 4 bytes of IP
if (answer_rr_dns.RDLENGTH == 4) {

new_addr_info = tfDnsAllocAddrInfo();
// Further parsing...
// Linking the new addrinfo to the list (t_dns_cache_entry.dnscAddrInfoPtr)

} else {

// Exit with error code

10

11

}

}

However, in the case of MX records, the order in which validity checks are applied is diﬀerent:

// Check if the type fits for MX resource records
if (t_dns_cache_entry.dnscQueryType == DNS_TYPE_MX && answer_rr_dns.type == DNS_TYPE_MX) {

new_addr_info = tfDnsAllocAddrInfo();
if (new_addr_info != NULL) {

if (answer_rr_dns.RDLENGTH >= 2) {

// Further parsing...
// Linking the new addrinfo to the list (t_dns_cache_entry.dnscAddrInfoPtr)

} else {

// Exit with error code

}

}

}

12

According to this logic, if an MX resource record with RDLENGTH ﬁeld smaller than 2 is
supplied, then a new addrinfo struct will be allocated but the function will ﬁnish execution
before linking it to the cache entry. Since DNS parsing failure results only in the cache entry
and all subﬁelds - including the addrinfo list - being freed, this new unlinked addrinfo will not
be freed, resulting in a memory leak. We can craft a packet containing a few valid MX records
to allocate a buﬀer of arbitrary size, concluding with an invalid MX record that will place an

unlinked addrinfo at the end of our buﬀer. Upon DNS parsing exit, all valid MX names and
addrinfo structs will be freed except for the unlinked addrinfo, resulting in a hole pattern as
described above.

4.5 Overwriting a Far Call Destination

After reliable overﬂow of tsDnsCacheEntry.dnscAddrInfoPtr is achieved, we need to pick a
destination address to write our CNAME buﬀer pointer to. Since our overﬂow allows alpha-
numerical values (including “.” and “-”) only, our accessible address space is rather limited.
Unfortunately, none of the loaded ﬁrmware ﬁles (bootloader, OS, application) are loaded in an
alpha-numeric accessible address. However, we have a few assisting factors. First, the last byte
of our overﬂow, as common in string overﬂows, is a null byte. In little-endian architectures, the
the last byte is the most signiﬁcant one - in our case, segment high byte. Second, because of
the weird way segmentation works on this processor (8-bit shift instead of 4-bit), we can reach
non-alphanumeric segments relatively easily.

Figure 4.3: Segmented address to linear address calculation

As  apparent  from  ﬁgure  4.3,  it  is  possible  to  pick  XX  and  YY  values  that  are  alphanumeric,

yet  their  sum  contains  a  high  non-alphanumeric  byte.

It turns out that most of the code handling heap operations (free, malloc, etc.)  is relocated
dynamically  to  segment  0x008C.  This  segment  is  reachable  using  the  method  described  above.
One of the ways to achieve code execution by writing a  pointer  to a  code  section address  is

to  overwrite  a  far  call  opcode.  In  x86  16-bit  far  calls  are  encoded  as  following:

Figure 4.4: x86 far-call opcode

Our  far  pointer  write  ﬁts  the  oﬀset-segment  pattern,  so  we  can  change  the  destination  of

any  far-call  in  an  alpha-numerical  address  to  point  to  our  controlled  CNAME  buﬀer.

The  far-call  we  chose  is  located  in  an  error  ﬂow  in  free  which  originally  calls  assert.  We
speciﬁcally chose this far-call destination for two reasons.  First, this error ﬂow will be executed
when the MX record from which our overﬂow happened.  This allows us to control the shellcode
execution.  Second,  in  this  error  ﬂow,  the  stack  frame  will  contain  a  pointer  to  the  end  of  the
CNAME  buﬀer  that  contains  our  alphanumeric  shellcode.  As  will  be  explained  later  on,  when
running  an  alphanumeric  shellcode,  a  pointer  to  a  location  in  the  shellcode  is  necessary  to
achieve  arbitrary  shellcode  execution  (rather  than  alphanumeric  only).

4.6  Executing  Shellcode

Building on previous stages, we can now assume there is a malicious far-call in the free() error
ﬂow.  This  ﬂow  will  be  triggered  when  the  preﬁx  and  postﬁx  size  ﬁelds  of  the  block  passed  to

Ripple20 c(cid:13) 2020 JSOF Ltd.

20

Technical White Paper

free() do not match (see section 4.2.2). This is necessarily true for the MX name buﬀer from
which the overﬂow happened: because the overﬂow is linear, it will always overwrite the postﬁx
size ﬁeld, but not the preﬁx size ﬁeld. This mismatch will cause the error ﬂow to take place,
executing our far-call and redirecting execution to the buﬀer containing our arbitrary CNAME.

4.6.1 Triggering tsDnsCacheEntry Free

The free() error ﬂow will be executed only when the cache entry is freed. This won’t happen
automatically, even though the DNS TTL can be speciﬁed to be zero because the cache-entry
TTL is checked and subsequently freed only when another DNS request for the same domain is
generated by the device. DNS cache entry freeing can be remotely triggered by causing system
events that trigger MX requests, such as attempting to login to the Web/FTP/SSH/Telnet
interfaces with bad credentials. Freeing should also take place without manual interference due
to regular system events (routine system checks, power ﬂuctuations, etc).

4.6.2 Executing Arbitrary Shellcode

Reaching arbitrary shellcode execution from alpha-numeric shellcode on x86 is a well-known
problem and has been discussed in depth and solved long ago. 16-bit mode makes this a bit
trickier, but the essence is the same. We used a technique inspired by [1], in which a two-stage
decoder is implemented:

1. The ﬁrst decoder is completely alpha-numerical - using push/pop instructions to move
values between registers, and xor against memory in the cs segment to modify itself (self-
modifying). An alpha-numeric only shellcode decoder is diﬃcult to write without having
a pointer to a known position in the shellcode. In the execution context we chose the
free() assert error ﬂow because this way, when the shellcode starts running there is a
pointer on the stack to the end of the CNAME buﬀer, and this satisﬁes our prerequisite
for a pointer in to the shellcode. We used pop to move this pointer in to a register and
then use it to xor other parts of the shellcode, generating non-alphanumeric opcodes.
This stage also pushes the encoded arbitrary shellcode on the stack before handing over
execution to the next stage. One of the requirements for DNS names is having a “.”
character at least every 63 characters, but luckily in x86 this is the cs: preﬁx for memory
operations, which is needed anyway for this stage of decoding.

2. This stage is hard-coded and not arbitrary, to make writing the alpha-numerical decoder
from the previous stage easier (alpha-numerical x86 doesn’t allow complex ﬂow control).
However, it is non-alpha-numerical, allowing for more complex code structures such as
loops, arbitrary memory manipulation and arbitrary jumps & calls. This stage loops over
and decodes the encoded alpha-numeric code we pushed to the stack in the last stage,
ﬁnishing by handing over execution to it.

When these decoders are done, we can run any payload without worrying about encoding
issues. Our payload of choice is rather simple, as it just turns oﬀ the UPS power outlets by
calling a built-in function, but any other payload of course can be executed as well.

4.7 Putting It All Together

To recollect, the exploit consists of four main stages:

1. Crashing the device by waiting for any DNS request and corrupting the heap. This is

done to reach a deterministic heap state.

2. Shaping the heap by replying to the ﬁrst 2 MX requests with resource records of carefully
chosen sizes, followed by a corrupted MX resource record that will cause a memory leak,
securing our hole.

3. Overﬂow tsDnsCacheEntry via the 3rd MX request, resulting in a pointer to a controlled

buﬀer being written as a far call destination.

4. Trigger or wait for an event that causes a DNS request to be issued and our tsDns-
CacheEntry to be freed. Execution will be redirected through the corrupted far-call to
our alphanumeric shellcode. This results in a two-stage decoding procedure being executed
leading to arbitrary shellcode execution from the stack.

## Treck IP stacks contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#257161

Original Release Date: 2020-06-16 | Last Revised: 2022-09-20

---

### Overview

Treck IP stack implementations for embedded systems are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. This set of vulnerabilities was researched and reported by JSOF, who calls them [Ripple20](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

### Description

Treck IP network stack software is designed for and used in a variety of embedded systems. The software can be licensed and integrated in various ways, including compiled from source, licensed for modification and reuse and finally as a dynamic or static linked library. Treck IP software contains multiple vulnerabilities, most of which are caused by [memory management bugs](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152142). For more details on the vulnerabilities introduced by these bugs, see Treck's  [Vulnerability Response Information](https://treck.com/vulnerability-response-information/) and JSOF's [Ripple20 advisory](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

Historically-related KASAGO TCP/IP middleware from Zuken Elmic (formerly Elmic Systems) is also affected by some of these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities likely affect industrial control systems and medical devices. Please see ICS-CERT Advisory [ICSA-20-168-01](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-168-01) for more information.

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities will vary due to the combination of build and runtime options used while developing different embedded systems. This diversity of implementations and the lack of supply chain visibility has exasperated the problem of accurately assessing the impact of these vulnerabilities. In summary, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to use specially-crafted network packets to cause a denial of service, disclose information, or execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

Update to the latest stable version of Treck IP stack software (6.0.1.67 or later). Please contact Treck at security@treck.com. Downstream users of embedded systems that incorporate Treck IP stacks should contact their embedded system vendor.

#### Block anomalous IP traffic

Consider blocking network attacks via deep packet inspection. In some cases, modern switches, routers, and firewalls will drop malformed packets with no additional configuration. It is recommended that such security features are not disabled. Below is a list of possible mitigations that can be applied as appropriate to your network environment.

* Normalize or reject IP fragmented packets (IP Fragments) if not supported in your environment
* Disable or block IP tunneling, both IPv6-in-IPv4 or IP-in-IP tunneling if not required
* Block IP source routing and any IPv6 deprecated features like routing headers (see also [VU#267289](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/267289))
* Enforce TCP inspection and reject malformed TCP packets
* Block unused ICMP control messages such MTU Update and Address Mask updates
* Normalize DNS through a secure recursive server or application layer firewall
* Ensure that you are using reliable OSI layer 2 equipment (Ethernet)
* Provide DHCP/DHCPv6 security with feature like DHCP snooping
* Disable or block IPv6 multicast if not used in switching infrastructure

Further recommendations are available [here](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/recommendations.md).

#### Detect anomalous IP traffic

Suricata IDS has built-in decoder-event rules that can be customized to detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. See the rule below for an example. A larger set of selected [vu-257161.rules](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/vu-257161.rules) are available from the CERT/CC Github repository.

#### Vendor Statement

Green Hills Software LLCâs GHnetâ¢ v2 network stack is based on the network stack from Treck Inc. Treck informed Green Hills Software of multiple vulnerabilities in its network stack, which were found by a third party.

While GHnet v2 is based on Treckâs network stack, the two are not identical. Green Hills Software has made many improvements, added new features, and fixed bugs in the product. Because of these improvements and INTEGRITYâs separation kernel architecture, the impact of these vulnerabilities on GHnet v2 is far less severe.

Green Hills Software has and will continue to advocate for running middleware, driver, and application code in partitioned virtual address spaces, rather than in the kernel. The INTEGRITY Real-Time Operating System was designed to provide isolation between applications and the kernel, protecting the rest of the system if an application fails or misbehaves. Due to the isolation provided by INTEGRITY, running the GHnet v2 stack in a virtual address space significantly reduces the impact of these vulnerabilities. Green Hills Software strongly recommends that the GHnet v2 network stack, all other middleware, and all application code be placed in separate virtual address spaces.

Green Hills Software will include fixes for these vulnerabilities in future releases of GHnet v2, and is making patches available to customers on previous releases. If you have questions about how these vulnerabilities may affect your system, please contact your Green Hills Software sales representative, or contact Green Hills Software Technical Support.
