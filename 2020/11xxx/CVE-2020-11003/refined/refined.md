Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and DNS rebinding. The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, and it can be exploited via DNS rebinding techniques to bypass typical same-origin policy protections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to potentially execute actions on behalf of a user without the user's consent.
*   **DNS Rebinding:** The application doesn't properly defend against DNS rebinding attacks. This allows an attacker to bypass browser security policies and potentially communicate with the vulnerable application on the user's local machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially read or write to the vulnerable application running on a user's machine. This could include modifying data, accessing sensitive information, or performing other unauthorized actions.
*   The attack is facilitated by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a malicious website.
*   This malicious website exploits DNS rebinding to gain access to the user's local network where the vulnerable application runs.
*   Once the attacker controls the domain via DNS rebinding, they can use CSRF techniques to send requests to the vulnerable application on the user's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website.
*   The attacker needs the user to visit this malicious website while having the vulnerable application running.
*   The attacker needs to be capable of performing a DNS rebinding attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the `@fraction/oasis` package, versions prior to 2.15.0.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.15.0. Users are advised to update to this version or higher.
*   There are no workarounds besides upgrading.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as high.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Christian Bundy and zozs.
*   There is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.
