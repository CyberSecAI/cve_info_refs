Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11081:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way osquery was built with OpenSSL. The build process included compression support, which is not actually used by osquery. This compression functionality depended on the `zlib1.dll` library.  Due to this dependency, osquery was trying to load the `zlib1.dll` dynamically at runtime on Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Search Order Hijacking:**  When an application attempts to load a DLL, Windows follows a specific search order. If a user-writable directory is present in the system's `PATH` environment variable and a malicious `zlib1.dll` is placed in such directory, then osquery will load this malicious library instead of the intended one.
- **Unnecessary Dependency:**  The inclusion of zlib compression within the OpenSSL build, despite not being used by osquery, introduced an unnecessary dependency. This introduced an attack vector via DLL hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** If a malicious `zlib1.dll` is loaded, it will execute with the same privileges as the osqueryd.exe process. Since osqueryd runs with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM), this allows an attacker to gain system-level code execution, leading to full control of the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to write to a directory present in the system's `PATH` environment variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a user account on the target Windows system.
- **Write Access to Path Directory:** The attacker needs to be able to write a malicious DLL (`zlib1.dll`) to a directory included in the system's PATH.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by disabling the OpenSSL compression option during the build process, effectively removing the dependency on `zlib1.dll`.
- The issue was present in osquery versions 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.2.0, and 4.3.0, and was fixed in 4.4.0.
- The recommended workaround for affected systems involved restricting write access to directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable. This is a general security best practice for windows systems.
- The vulnerability was identified by the Facebook security team and was reported as an issue on the osquery GitHub repository.
