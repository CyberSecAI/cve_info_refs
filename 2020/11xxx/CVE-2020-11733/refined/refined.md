{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to execute shell metacharacters within a restricted SSH shell provided by Spirent TestCenter and Avalanche appliance firmware. The restricted shell is intended only for network configuration but does not properly sanitize inputs, allowing an attacker to escape the restricted environment.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Privilege Escalation",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization",
      "Insecure default configuration"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root access to the appliance's management interface. This allows the attacker to install and execute arbitrary applications, read sensitive information (e.g., admin configuration source code), and compromise the device's intended functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access (SSH)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires access to the restricted SSH shell, which is available via default credentials on the affected devices."
