Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11074:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$confirm` variable within the Smarty template context in PrestaShop. This variable, used in the `admin-dev/themes/default/template/helpers/list/list_action_delete.tpl` file, is directly inserted into the `onclick` event handler for delete actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unescaped User Input:** The `$confirm` variable, which can be controlled by an attacker, is not properly escaped before being used in the JavaScript `confirm()` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the affected page, resulting in a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's browser session.
*   **Account Takeover:** Through malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the admin user, or redirect the user to a phishing site.
*   **Data Manipulation/Theft:** An attacker could use the injected code to modify or steal sensitive data displayed in the admin panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Admin Panel:** The attack is triggered through the PrestaShop administration panel by manipulating the name of a quick access item, which populates the `$confirm` variable.
*   **Database:** The malicious code is stored in the `ps_quick_access` table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to PrestaShop Admin Panel:** The attacker needs some level of access to the admin panel to create/modify the name of quick access items.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know where the injection point is in the system.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `admin-dev/themes/default/template/helpers/list/list_action_delete.tpl` file.
*   The fix involves escaping the `$confirm` variable when it is used in the `onclick` event handler. The commit d122b82 contains the fix.
*   The vulnerability affects PrestaShop versions up to 1.7.6.5. It is fixed in version 1.7.6.6.
*   A workaround is provided to manually delete the malicious quick access items from the `ps_quick_access` table via an SQL query.
*   The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2020-11074 and is associated with the GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-v4pg-q2cv-f7x4.
*   The severity is rated as moderate.
