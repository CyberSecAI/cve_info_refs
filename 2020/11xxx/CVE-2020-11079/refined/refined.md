Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `dns-sync` npm package. Specifically, the `resolve` function in versions prior to 0.2.1 did not properly sanitize the `rrtype` argument which is used in a shell command. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands via the `rrtype` parameter passed to the `resolve` function.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not adequately sanitize or validate the `rrtype` input before using it in a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or machine running the vulnerable application.
- **Complete System Compromise:** RCE can be leveraged to gain full access to the target system, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or cause other malicious damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** Attackers can supply a crafted string for the `rrtype` argument that contains shell commands. This malicious input will then be executed by the underlying operating system shell.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Influence `rrtype` Argument:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the value of the `rrtype` argument that is passed to the `dns-sync.resolve` function. This would typically happen if the application using the `dns-sync` library allows user input to influence the rrtype parameter (or if an attacker can inject input indirectly via other application flaws).

*   The advisory ([GHSA-wh69-wc6q-7888](https://github.com/skoranga/node-dns-sync/security/advisories/GHSA-wh69-wc6q-7888)) explicitly mentions that the vulnerability could lead to remote code execution if a client of the library uses untrusted input.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by GitHub Engineer Erik Krogh Kristensen ([@erik-krogh](https://github.com/erik-krogh)).
*   The fixed version is 0.2.1, and versions prior to 0.2.0 are affected.
