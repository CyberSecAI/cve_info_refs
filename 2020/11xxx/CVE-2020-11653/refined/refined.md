Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability occurs in Varnish Cache when it communicates with a TLS termination proxy using the PROXY protocol version 2. An issue arises with the handling of the proxy protocol data, which can lead to an assertion failure within Varnish.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Assertion Failure:** The primary vulnerability is that a malformed or specifically crafted proxy protocol v2 payload can trigger an assertion failure in Varnish.
-   **Lack of Proper Input Handling:**  The core issue appears to be a lack of robust validation or handling of the data received from the proxy protocol v2, leading to the assertion when certain conditions are met.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The assertion failure causes the Varnish daemon to restart. This results in a temporary loss of service as the cache is cleared upon restart and needs to be repopulated. This degrades performance by increasing cache misses and backend load.
-   **Performance Loss**: The restart leads to a performance loss due to increased cache misses.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, where a client, through a TLS termination proxy, sends a crafted PROXY version 2 payload to the Varnish server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the Varnish server, typically through the intermediary TLS termination proxy.
-   **Proxy Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware that the Varnish server is configured with a TLS proxy using proxy protocol version 2, and has the ability to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

-   **Mitigation:** Mitigation can be achieved by:
    -   Switching to proxy protocol version 1.
    -   Disallowing non-matching SNI names in Hitch (if Hitch is the TLS termination proxy).
    -   Increasing the session workspace size in Varnish to prevent memory exhaustion (the default is 512 bytes, 34k was suggested when using Hitch as a TLS proxy).
-   **No RCE or Data Leaks:** It is explicitly stated that there is no potential for remote code execution or data leaks.
