# VSV00005 Varnish HTTP Proxy Protocol V2 Denial of Service[¶](#vsv00005-varnish-http-proxy-protocol-v2-denial-of-service "Permalink to this heading")

[CVE-2020-11653](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11653)

Date: 2020-02-04

An assert can be triggered in Varnish Cache when using Varnish with a TLS
termination proxy, and the proxy and Varnish use the PROXY version 2
protocol to communicate connection details. Depending on the type of proxy
used and the details it include in the proxy payload, it may be possible
for remote clients to cause Varnish to assert and restart, making it a
denial of service attack.

The assert will cause Varnish to restart, and the cache will be empty
after the restart. This will reduce overall performance due to an
increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on the backend
servers.

There is no potential for remote code execution or data leaks related to
this vulnerability.

Mitigation is possible by configuration tuning, or by updating to a fixed
version of Varnish Cache.

## Versions affected[¶](#versions-affected "Permalink to this heading")

* Varnish Cache releases 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2, 6.0.3, 6.0.4, 6.0.5, 6.1.0,
  6.1.1, 6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.3.0, 6.3.1.
* 6.0 LTS by Varnish Software up to and including 6.0.5

## Fixed in[¶](#fixed-in "Permalink to this heading")

* Varnish Cache 6.2.3
* Varnish Cache 6.3.2
* 6.0.6 LTS by Varnish Software
* GitHub Varnish Cache master branch at commit
  2d8fc1a784a1e26d78c30174923a2b14ee2ebf62

## Mitigation[¶](#mitigation "Permalink to this heading")

It is possible to mitigate the problem in several ways.

### Switch to proxy protocol version 1[¶](#switch-to-proxy-protocol-version-1 "Permalink to this heading")

Setups using proxy protocol version 1 are not affected, so if the TLS
termination proxy used supports both versions, switching to version 1 will
mitigate the problem. This is the recommended mitigation method.

Note that version 1 of the proxy protocol will communicate less details
about the connection than what is possible when using version 2. For
example the SNI server name used by the connecting client will not be
transferred, and can then not be queried using the Proxy VMOD in VCL.

When using the Hitch TLS proxy, version 1 of the proxy protocol can be
selected by replacing any `write-proxy` or `write-proxy-v2` options
with `write-proxy-v1`, and restarting Hitch.

### Disallow non-matching SNI names in Hitch[¶](#disallow-non-matching-sni-names-in-hitch "Permalink to this heading")

When using Hitch as the TLS termination proxy, one can work around the
problem by disallowing client connects connecting using a SNI servername
that does not match any of the configured certificates. This can be done
by adding the `sni-nomatch-abort` option to the Hitch configuration.

Please note that this mitigation strategy is only effective if none of the
configured certificates allow wildcard domain names.

### Increase the session workspace[¶](#increase-the-session-workspace "Permalink to this heading")

By increasing the session workspace, one can make sure that an attacker
can not successfully exhaust the space available, thus not triggering the
assert. The size it needs to be set at depends on the TLS proxy in use,
and what fields it include in the proxy payload and how a remote client
can influence its contents.

By default the session workspace is set to 512 bytes. The session
workspace can be changed by setting the `workspace_session` Varnish
parameter, and restarting the Varnish daemon.

When using Hitch as the TLS proxy, setting the session workspace to 34k
will mitigate the problem completely. Add “-p workspace\_session=34k” to
the varnishd command line to set this value.

Note that increasing the session workspace will increase the amount of
memory Varnish holds per connection, and you may want to decrease the
memory cache size to compensate.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-11653 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11653)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.6 LTS, 6.1.x and 6.2.x before 6.2.3, and 6.3.x before 6.3.2. It occurs when communication with a TLS termination proxy uses PROXY version 2. There can be an assertion failure and daemon restart, which causes a performance loss.

Package        : varnish
Version        : 6.1.1-1+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-11653 CVE-2022-45060
Debian Bug     : 956307 1023751

Martin van Kervel Smedshammer discovered a request forgery attack can be
performed on Varnish Cache servers that have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An
attacker may introduce characters through the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are
invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to
produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This may in turn be used to
successfully exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
6.1.1-1+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.

For the detailed security status of varnish please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/varnish>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
