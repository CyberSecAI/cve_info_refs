Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-11467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure deserialization of user-controlled data within the theme template editing feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure deserialization: The application deserializes data provided by the user without proper sanitization or validation, leading to the execution of malicious code.
- Insufficient input validation within the theme template editor.
- Usage of TWIG templating engine, where access to certain objects could be abused to reach PHP's `unserialize` function.
- POP gadget chain vulnerability in Guzzle library is used to achieve code execution

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the DeskPro application.
- Full compromise of the helpdesk instance, including all information exchanged between agents and clients
- Leakage of application configurations and secret keys
- Possible pivot point to infiltrate the corporate network
- Ability to read, modify and delete any data on the server

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the theme template editing feature, requiring administrative privileges.
- An attacker needs to have admin access to use the vulnerable feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to first gain administrative access to the DeskPro instance before exploiting this vulnerability. This can be achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The blog post from Redforce provides more technical details than the Deskpro advisory, including specific API endpoints affected by other vulnerabilities used to gain admin access, and the specific vulnerable function.
- The Redforce post also provides example code to trigger the vulnerability, along with a sample exploit chain using PHPGGC.
- The vendor's advisory mentions that the issue is classified as a privilege escalation fault, but doesn't mention RCE specifically.

The content from `support.deskpro.com` confirms the security issue and its classification as privilege escalation but withholds technical details.
