{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-11035",
    "description": "The CSRF tokens are weakly generated. The rand and uniqid and of course MD5 do not provide secure values.",
    "affected_versions": "> 0.83.3",
    "patched_versions": "9.4.6",
    "root_cause": "The CSRF tokens are generated using `md5(uniqid(rand(), true))` which does not provide secure values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of weak pseudorandom number generator (rand)",
      "Use of uniqid with insufficient entropy",
      "Use of MD5 hashing algorithm"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass CSRF protection due to the predictable nature of token generation.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could use a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack to perform actions on behalf of a user.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that includes a predictable CSRF token."
