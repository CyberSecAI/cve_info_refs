{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The login authentication component lacks limitations on the length of authentication messages and the rate at which they are sent.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted message length and rate in the login authentication component.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can overwhelm the authentication process by sending excessively long messages or sending messages at an excessive rate, making the service unavailable.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network based attack, attacker sends authentication messages to the login component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to the login component of the affected system."
