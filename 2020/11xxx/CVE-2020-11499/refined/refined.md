Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11499:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user input when updating firmware details, specifically the "tags" and "version" fields (and potentially others). The data is stored unsanitized in the application's database.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the "tags" or "version" fields when updating firmware details. The application posts the data to the "upload-analysis/[uid]" page, which then runs the "\_get\_meta\_from\_request()" function in `/src/helperFunctions/mongo_task_conversion.py`.
*   **Impact:** Each time a page is requested that displays the injected data, the JavaScript code will be executed, leading to XSS. This can allow the attacker to perform malicious actions such as stealing user cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, or defacing the website.
*   **Mitigation:** The issue was resolved by using the `escape` function within Flask to sanitize the user input before storing it in the database.
*   **Location:** `/src/helperFunctions/mongo_task_conversion.py`
