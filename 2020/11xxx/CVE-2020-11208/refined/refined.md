The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities found in Qualcomm's Snapdragon DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chips. Specifically, it mentions CVE-2020-11208 as one of the vulnerabilities discovered during their research.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Downgrade vulnerability:** The lack of version control for DSP libraries allows an attacker to load an older, vulnerable version of a library, even if a patched version exists on the device. This is achieved by manipulating the `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to prioritize a malicious library.
*   **Bugs in Hexagon SDK:** The Hexagon SDK, used for developing DSP software, contains flaws in its code generation process for marshaling function arguments, specifically related to string and in-out buffer handling. This leads to vulnerabilities such as heap overflows due to improper handling of argument lengths.
*   **Improper input validation in skeleton libraries:** Skeleton libraries generated by the SDK contain vulnerabilities due to insufficient validation of the size and offsets of input arguments. This allows attackers to read from arbitrary memory locations, cause crashes and potentially escalate to code execution.
*  **QDI driver vulnerabilities:** Flaws in QuRT (Qualcomm's Real Time OS) QDI (QuRT Driver Invocation) drivers can be exploited through specially crafted driver invocation messages to cause crashes, arbitrary reads/writes and code execution within the driver context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of version control:** No mechanism to prevent loading of older, vulnerable library versions.
*   **Signed integer overflow:** Type casting to signed integers during size validation allows for negative values to bypass checks, leading to buffer overflows.
*   **Inadequate input validation:** The skeleton libraries' `invoke` functions do not properly validate the size of input buffers, leading to read/write out of bounds.
*   **Improper handling of string arguments:** Incorrect marshaling of string arguments with negative length can lead to heap-based reads/crashes.
*   **Vulnerabilities in QDI drivers:**  QDI drivers exhibit vulnerabilities including out-of-bounds read/write issues and potential code execution due to lack of input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information exfiltration:** Attackers can access sensitive data, including photos, videos, call recordings, microphone data, and GPS location.
*   **Denial-of-service:** Attackers can render the mobile phone unresponsive, effectively causing a targeted denial-of-service attack.
*   **Malware persistence:** Malware can hide its activities and become unremovable by executing within the DSP context.
*   **DSP kernel panic:** Vulnerabilities in QDI drivers can cause the DSP to crash, rebooting the mobile device.
*   **Privilege escalation:** By exploiting vulnerabilities, attackers can gain control of the DSP user domain and potentially the guest OS or kernel, leading to execution of arbitrary code on the DSP.
*   **Compromised camera and audio:** Since the cDSP is responsible for preprocessing video from camera sensors, an attacker can intercept or modify this data. Similarly, the aDSP which handles audio can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Android application:**  A specially crafted Android application can exploit the vulnerabilities by:
    *   Loading a vulnerable, old version of a DSP skeleton library by manipulating the `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH`.
    *   Directly invoking DSP methods through functions like `remote_handle_open` and `remote_handle_invoke` bypassing stub code and providing crafted parameters to trigger the vulnerabilities
    *  Sending specific crafted messages to QDI drivers to exploit driver-level vulnerabilities

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to install an application on an Android device:** An attacker needs to be able to install a malicious app on a vulnerable device.
*   **Knowledge of DSP interfaces:** The attacker needs an understanding of the FastRPC mechanism, DSP library locations, and how to prepare input for specific functions in the skel/object libraries.
*   **Access to vulnerable libraries:** The attacker needs to have access to older, vulnerable versions of DSP libraries. This can be done by including them in the app's assets.
*  **Reverse engineering skills:** The attacker needs to reverse engineer QuRT binaries to find the addresses of driver invocation functions and to craft specific exploit messages.
