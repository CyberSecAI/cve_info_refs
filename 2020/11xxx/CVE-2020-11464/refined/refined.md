Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-11464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient access control in the Deskpro API. Specifically, the `/api/people` endpoint lacks proper privilege validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The API endpoint `/api/people` allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** A normal user can retrieve sensitive details of all registered users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain full names, privilege levels, email addresses, phone numbers, and potentially other sensitive information of all users registered on the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While this specific vulnerability doesn't directly grant privilege escalation, the information gained can be leveraged to aid in further attacks, such as forging JWT tokens with administrative privileges by learning the admin email address, as shown in the provided attack chain.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Deskpro instance to make API requests.
*   **API endpoint access:** The attacker sends a GET request to `/api/people` endpoint

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic User Account:** The attacker needs to be a registered user, which can often be achieved through self-registration on the helpdesk system.
*   **API knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the existence and format of the vulnerable API endpoint.
