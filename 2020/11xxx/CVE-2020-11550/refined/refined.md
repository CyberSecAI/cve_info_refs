{
  "CVE-2020-11550": {
    "Root cause": "The authentication mechanism used by the SOAP API on Netgear Orbi Pro WiFi Mesh devices relies on a predictable password generation scheme based on the MAC addresses of the communicating devices. This allows an attacker to calculate the password.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Predictable password generation",
       "Lack of proper authentication",
      "Exposure of sensitive information via unauthenticated API"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can remotely read sensitive information, such as SSIDs and Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) of all configured WiFi networks, without prior knowledge. This can lead to unauthorized network access.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the SOAP interface accessible via HTTP on the local network (LAN or Wireless 1, or Wireless 2 if isolation is disabled).",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network (wired or wireless) as the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is required."
