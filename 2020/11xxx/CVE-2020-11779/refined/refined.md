The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0527, affecting multiple router and gateway models. Although this advisory is not associated with CVE-2020-11779, it does provide useful vulnerability information.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability present in the web interface of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the device's web interface, which are then stored and executed when other users access the same interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the router's management interface
- Stealing of credentials
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Further compromise of the network.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious script code into a field or area of the device's web interface that is then stored on the device. When other users access this page/field the malicious code will be executed in their browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would require access to the web interface of the vulnerable device, likely as an authenticated user, in order to inject the malicious script.
The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to store the XSS payload.

**Affected devices (and vulnerable firmware versions):**
