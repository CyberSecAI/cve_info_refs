The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Qualcomm's Snapdragon DSP (Digital Signal Processor) but specifically mentions CVE-2020-11209 along with other CVEs assigned to these vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Downgrade vulnerability:** Lack of version control for DSP libraries allows loading older, vulnerable versions by manipulating the `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This bypasses patches by loading an old version of a library.
*   **Bugs in Hexagon SDK:** Automatically generated stub and skel code from the Hexagon SDK contains vulnerabilities, specifically in how string and in-out buffer arguments are marshaled. These vulnerabilities include:
    *   **Incorrect length comparisons:** Signed integer comparisons allow negative lengths to bypass checks, leading to out-of-bounds reads on the heap.
    *   **Heap overflows:** Negative input buffer lengths in in-out buffer marshaling cause heap overflows due to type casting to signed integers during boundary checks.
*   **Vulnerabilities in QDI drivers:**  Multiple vulnerabilities exist in QuRT's QDI drivers, stemming from lack of proper input validation when handling driver requests. These can be triggered by sending malformed data via the qurt_qdi_handle_invoke API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of version control:** No mechanisms to prevent loading of older vulnerable libraries.
*   **Integer overflow:** Incorrect handling of lengths as signed integers, leading to bypass of size checks.
*   **Heap overflow:** Copying data to an output buffer without proper size validation, leading to overwriting memory outside the intended buffer, potentially resulting in code execution.
*   **Out of Bounds Read:** When processing the input arguments a crafted source offset leads to reading outside the allocated memory causing a crash, but also allowing arbitrary memory read in the DSP heap.
*   **Lack of input validation:** Improper handling of parameters when calling the DSP drivers, leading to crashes or potentially arbitrary memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers could exfiltrate sensitive data like photos, videos, call recordings, microphone data, and GPS locations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could make the phone unresponsive by causing kernel panics.
*   **Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the DSP, potentially gaining control over the device.
*   **Malware Hiding:** Malicious code can be hidden within the DSP, bypassing traditional security scans.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining access to kernel drivers via the DSP can expand the privileges of the attacker up to the rights of the guest OS or DSP Kernel.
*  **Camera and microphone hijacking**: Given the access to the DSP, the attacker has access to raw data stream coming from these sensors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Android Application:** A malicious app can exploit the vulnerabilities by loading older versions of skel libraries, crafting malicious input to DSP methods, or directly calling the DSP drivers.
*   **Direct Invocation:** By using `remote_handle_open` and `remote_handle_invoke`, an attacker can bypass the stub code and directly interact with the skeleton libraries on the DSP.
*   **QDI Driver Manipulation:** By crafting specific QDI method IDs and arguments, attackers can trigger vulnerabilities in the drivers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to install an application:** The attacker needs to be able to install a malicious application on the target device.
*   **Understanding of DSP communication:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how the CPU communicates with the DSP using FastRPC.
*   **Knowledge of skel/object libraries:** The attacker must know where these libraries are located and the path of the desired method to call.
*   **Knowledge of QDI drivers:** The attacker must have the knowledge and capability to reverse-engineer the device to find the driver invocation functions and create crafted input parameters for method calls to the DSP drivers.
*   **Ability to manipulate environment variables:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The research found over 400 unique crashes across multiple DSP libraries.
*   The issues affect a wide range of devices from various vendors (Google, Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, OnePlus, etc.) using Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs.
*   Check Point Research reported the vulnerabilities to Qualcomm, and fixes were issued in the November 2020 Qualcomm Security Patch. However, the downgrade vulnerability allows attackers to potentially bypass these fixes.
