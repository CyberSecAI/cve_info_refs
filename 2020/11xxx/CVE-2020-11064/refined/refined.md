Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11064

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTML `placeholder` attributes within the TYPO3 Form Engine. Specifically, these attributes were found to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) when they contained data from other database records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the injection of malicious scripts via the `placeholder` attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of web pages
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Theft of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious backend user injecting JavaScript code via database records that are later displayed in the `placeholder` attribute within the Form Engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires a valid backend user account to exploit the vulnerability. This implies the attacker must have some level of access/permissions within the TYPO3 system, though not necessarily an administrative account

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in TYPO3 versions 9.0.0 up to 9.5.16 and 10.0.0 up to 10.4.1.
- The issue is resolved in versions 9.5.17 and 10.4.2.
- The CVSS score is 5.4 with the vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C, which indicates a moderate severity.
