Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11674:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple vulnerabilities were identified within the Cerner medico hospital information management system's custom components, specifically in the `slim_proxy`, `dpscrypt`, `ntmkcr`, and `mkdict` programs. The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices, including buffer overflows due to missing bounds checks, use of insecure functions like `strcpy`, and format string vulnerabilities with `sprintf`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer overflows:** Occur in `slim_proxy.c` (`showInode()` function, due to potentially oversized result from `iso2utf()`), `dpscrypt.c` (copying command-line arguments and environment variables using `strcpy()`), and `mkdict.c` (copying an environment variable into a fixed-size buffer using `strcpy()`).
    *   **Uninitialized variable usage:**  `slim_proxy.c`'s `refreshList()` function uses the variable `output` without initializing it.
    *   **Format string vulnerability:** `ntmkcr.c`'s `mod_key_opts()` and `mkdict.c`'s `mask_tick()` functions use `sprintf()` with the same variable as source and destination, leading to undefined behavior and potential data corruption.
    *   **Broken Encryption:** `dpscrypt.c` uses the insecure DES encryption algorithm. `crypt.cpp` provides an implementation of this broken algorithm.
    *   **Lack of output escaping:** In `mkdict.c`, the `write_csvfile()` function writes output without escaping field delimiters (semicolons), which could lead to data injection if any of the fields contain a semicolon.
    *  **Missing Security Mitigations:** Compiled binaries lack common security mitigations such as stack canaries, FORTIFY\_SOURCE, RELRO, and PIE, making exploitation easier.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the software, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service. The software handles sensitive electronic health records (EHR).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Adjacent Network:** The `slim_proxy` process is running and listening on the network, suggesting it might be remotely exploitable. Other vulnerabilities might require local access or specific conditions, as described in the analysis section, where some bugs might be triggerable through the network if called by another tool on the system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have adjacent network access to the system running the vulnerable `slim_proxy` service to exploit the network-facing vulnerabilities. For other vulnerabilities, a local user or specific environment variables could be enough.
    * The attacker needs the ability to send specific inputs to trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered during a penetration test by X41 D-SEC GmbH.
*   The advisory lists multiple CVEs: CVE-2020-11674, CVE-2020-11675, CVE-2020-11676, and CVE-2020-11677 suggesting these vulnerabilities were found and reported together.
*   The provided content provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerabilities and their root causes than what's normally available in a CVE description.
*   Patches were released by Cerner to address these vulnerabilities (Defect 226386, Hotfix H26001200000).

**CVSS Score:** 6.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) indicates a medium severity vulnerability exploitable from an adjacent network with low attack complexity and no required privileges. This score is consistent with the vulnerabilities described.
