Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11465

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient access control at multiple API endpoints, specifically `/api/apps/*`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Normal users can access API endpoints that should be restricted to administrators. This allows them to control/install helpdesk applications and leak current applications' configurations.
*   **Configuration Leakage:** The configurations of applications, including those used for authentication (like JWT), can be accessed by unauthorized users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By leaking the JWT secret, an attacker can forge authentication tokens and impersonate any user on the system, including administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges to that of an administrator by exploiting the access control vulnerability, compromising the entire helpdesk system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Leaks application configurations, including sensitive credentials.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In combination with other vulnerabilities, leads to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests to specific API endpoints.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** Self-registration is enabled by default and the API is accessible to any registered user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to register a normal user account.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the DeskPro instance.
*   **Ability to make API requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.

**Additional Information (From Content):**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited to retrieve the JWT secret key.
*   The combination of this and other vulnerabilities allows an attacker to achieve RCE.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by a security research firm and reported through a responsible disclosure procedure.
*   DeskPro released a patch (v2019.8.0) to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects on-premise installations of DeskPro.
*   Bitdefender was using DeskPro and was vulnerable. They have patched the vulnerability promptly.
