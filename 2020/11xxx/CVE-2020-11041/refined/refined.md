  "CVE-2020-11041": {
    "description": "In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, an outside controlled array index is used unchecked for data used as configuration for sound backend (alsa, oss, pulse, ...). The most likely outcome is a crash of the client instance followed by no or distorted sound or a session disconnect. If a user cannot upgrade to the patched version, a workaround is to disable sound for the session. This has been patched in 2.1.0.",
    "root_cause": "An outside controlled array index is used without bounds checking when configuring the sound backend.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"

    "impact": "Crash of the client instance, no or distorted sound, session disconnect.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"

    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious RDP server can send a crafted audio configuration to trigger the vulnerability",
        "other_info": "The vulnerability is triggered due to a missing bounds check on the array index used for sound backend configuration. A workaround is to disable sound for the session. The issue is fixed in FreeRDP version 2.1.0."
