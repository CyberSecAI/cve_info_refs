    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into the page, potentially allowing them to perform unauthorized actions within the user's session, such as stealing cookies, hijacking sessions, or defacing the website. ",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request with the `woe_post_type` parameter containing malicious JavaScript or HTML."

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to click on a malicious link containing the crafted GET request or visit a page containing such link. No specific authentication is needed to inject the payload, but an authenticated admin is required for the exploit to have a security impact.",
