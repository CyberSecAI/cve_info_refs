Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11934:

**Root Cause:**

- The `snap userd`'s `OpenURL` method modifies the `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` environment variable before calling `/usr/bin/xdg-open`. Specifically, it prepends a directory controlled by the calling snap to the `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unsafe Environment Modification:** The `userd` process alters the environment of a process (xdg-open) it invokes, by modifying  `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`. This variable is used by xdg-open to locate `.desktop` files that define how to handle URI schemes.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `OpenURL` method does not sufficiently sanitize the path added to `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, allowing a malicious snap to point to a directory it controls.
- **Trust of User Supplied Data:** The application trusts the data supplied by the calling snap to determine where to look for URI handlers.
- **Sandboxing Bypass:** By prepending a snap-controlled directory to `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, the snap can effectively override the system's default URI handlers, including using a handler it provides within its confined environment but executed outside confinement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sandbox Escape:** A malicious snap can execute arbitrary code outside of its confinement by crafting a special `.desktop` file and placing it within the snap-controlled directory added to `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, which in turn is invoked by the xdg-open script.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can make the system execute arbitrary scripts by controlling the Exec line in the crafted .desktop file and calling xdg-open.
- **Host System Compromise:** Since the arbitrary code runs outside of the snap's sandbox, it can access and modify the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious snap uses the desktop interface to call "xdg-open help://whatever" (or any other URI scheme). This triggers the vulnerable `OpenURL` method.
- The malicious snap places a crafted `yelp.desktop` and a `mimeapps.list` files within its `$SNAP/usr/share/applications` directory.
- The vulnerable `userd` prepends the snap's `$SNAP/usr/share/applications` to the `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` when calling the system `xdg-open`.
- The system's `xdg-open` uses the modified `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` and finds the snap's crafted `yelp.desktop` to handle the "help:" URI scheme.
- The `Exec` line of the `yelp.desktop`  points to a script controlled by the malicious snap, which is then executed outside of the sandbox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create and publish a snap package:** The attacker needs to be able to create a snap package that contains the malicious `.desktop`, `mimeapps.list` files, and the arbitrary script.
- **Desktop Interface access:** The malicious snap needs to have the `desktop` interface plugged, which allows it to call the `xdg-open` command via the `snapctl user-open` command.
- **User interaction (indirect):** The user needs to install and run the malicious snap, which will then trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content also includes a patch that removes the modification of `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` within the `userd` process.
- The vulnerability affects systems running snapd, but not Ubuntu Core systems.
- The vulnerability is not specific to the "help:" URI scheme but is more likely to be exploited via this scheme.
