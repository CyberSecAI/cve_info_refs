Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11455

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the "File Manager" functionality of LimeSurvey.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `path` parameter in the `getZipFile` function is vulnerable to path traversal. An attacker can manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Unvalidated input:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `path` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files or data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  After downloading a file the application will also delete the file if the web service has write permissions, allowing attackers to delete critical system or LimeSurvey files, causing a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `getZipFile` endpoint, with a manipulated `path` parameter.
  - Example: `https://TARGET/limesurvey/index.php/admin/filemanager/sa/getZipFile?path=/../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LimeSurvey application.
- The attacker does not need authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit was tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4.
- The vulnerable parameter is identified as "path".
- The vulnerability is present in LimeSurvey version 4.1.11+200316 and potentially prior versions.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves removing the direct access to the path and instead using a session variable.
