Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-11556:

**Root Cause:**
- Lack of input validation in the SNMPc OnLine web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application.
- The injected scripts can be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- This allows for actions such as redirecting users, stealing session cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user if chained with other vulnerabilities like CSRF. In this specific case, the XSS is used to load a malicious page performing a CSRF request, which then enables the attacker to access the backup files via an SMB share and obtain sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating input fields that are not properly sanitized by the application.
- Specifically, the "My Shortcuts" functionality is used in the example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the web application.
- No special privileges are required to inject the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into loading the page with the XSS payload (can be done via social engineering) and for a persistent attack, convince users to interact with the page after the injection of the XSS payload.
