Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11741:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient trust placed in guest operating systems by the xenoprof code when "active" profiling is enabled. Specifically, the code does not treat the guest as a potential attacker and trusts it not to modify the buffer size or head/tail pointers in the shared ring structure used for profiling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Input Validation:** The xenoprof code trusts the guest OS regarding buffer size and ring pointers without sufficient validation.
- **Improper Access Control:** Unprivileged guests can request to map xenoprof buffers, even when profiling is not enabled for them. These unscrubbed buffers can lead to sensitive information leaks about other guests (CVE-2020-11740)
- **Trusting Guest OS:** The xenoprof code, when "active" profiling is enabled, assumes the guest OS is not malicious and will not manipulate the shared ring structure in unexpected ways.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leak:** A malicious guest can potentially access sensitive information about other guests by mapping unscrubbed xenoprof buffers (CVE-2020-11740).
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Guests with "active profiling" enabled can potentially crash the host system (DoS) by manipulating the shared ring structure.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The advisory suggests that privilege escalation cannot be ruled out, although the provided text doesn't offer explicit details on how this might be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by malicious guest operating systems running on the Xen hypervisor. 
- **Manipulation of shared memory:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the shared ring structure used by xenoprof. This includes the size information, and the head/tail pointers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Compromised PV Guest OS:**  The attacker needs control of a paravirtualized (PV) guest operating system. 
-   **Active Profiling Enabled (for DoS/Privilege Escalation):** For the DoS and potential privilege escalation attacks, the host administrator must have enabled "active profiling" for the malicious guest. Information leaks can happen even without active profiling.
-   **Xenoprof Enabled:** The Xen hypervisor build must have the xenoprof functionality enabled.
-   **X86 Architecture:** The vulnerability is only exploitable by x86 PV guests. Arm, x86 HVM, and PVH guests are not vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in all Xen versions back to at least 3.2.
- A patch is available, and it includes two parts. One for the information leak, and another for the DoS/potential privilege escalation that occur with active profiling.
