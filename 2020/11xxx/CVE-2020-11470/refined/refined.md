Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Local Privilege Escalation to Root**

*   **Root Cause:** The Zoom macOS installer uses the deprecated `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to execute a script (`runwithroot`) with root privileges. This API doesn't validate the binary being executed, allowing an attacker to modify the script before execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Use of the deprecated `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API.
    *   The `runwithroot` script is placed in a user-writable temporary directory before execution.
    *   Lack of validation of the script's integrity before execution as root.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unprivileged user can gain root privileges on the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  The attacker gains local access to the target macOS system.
    2.  The attacker identifies the temporary directory where the installer places the `runwithroot` script.
    3.  The attacker waits for the Zoom installer or updater to run.
    4.  Before the `runwithroot` script is executed by `security_authtrampoline` with root privileges, the attacker replaces it with a malicious script.
    5.  The malicious script executes with root privileges, giving the attacker full control of the system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the macOS system.
    *   Ability to write to the temporary directory used by the Zoom installer.
    *   Ability to monitor for the execution of zoom installers or updaters.

**Vulnerability 2: Code Injection for Mic & Camera Access**

*   **Root Cause:** The Zoom application is compiled with the Hardened Runtime but includes the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement. This entitlement allows arbitrary libraries to be loaded into the application's address space, bypassing the security provided by the Hardened Runtime.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The presence of the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement in a Hardened Runtime application.
    *   The application loads libraries from a location that is user-writable i.e., from within the application bundle.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the Zoom application. This code can then access the microphone and camera without user prompts/notification if Zoom already has those permissions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  The attacker gains local access to the target macOS system.
    2.  The attacker locates a library that Zoom uses from its application bundle (e.g., `libssl.1.0.0.dylib`)
    3.  The attacker replaces this library with a malicious one. The legitimate library is renamed, and a proxy library is created that loads the renamed legitimate library while injecting malicious code.
    4.  When Zoom is launched, the malicious library is loaded into the trusted Zoom process, inheriting Zoom's mic and camera permissions.
    5.  The malicious code can now record audio/video without additional prompts.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the macOS system.
    *   Ability to modify the contents of the Zoom application bundle.
