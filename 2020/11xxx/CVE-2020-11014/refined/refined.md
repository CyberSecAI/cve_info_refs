{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from incorrect handling of the `mandatory_coins` parameter during the creation of SLP mint transactions. The mint tool in Electron Cash SLP Edition did not properly use this parameter which could result in reordering of outputs, specifically the token mint baton receiver and token receiver addresses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parameter handling",
      "Output reordering vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is the potential for the minting authority baton to be sent to the wrong SLP address. This can lead to unauthorized issuance of new tokens or permanent loss of future minting capability if the baton is sent to an address not controlled by the token issuer.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the use of the 'Mint Tool' feature in affected versions of Electron Cash SLP Edition when creating SLP mint transactions.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would not need special capabilities, the attack is a side effect of a flaw in the softwareâ€™s handling of SLP mint transactions, therefore the attacker would only need to use the vulnerable software to perform the attack."
  },
  "additional_details": {
   "vulnerable_code": "The vulnerable code is located in `gui/qt/slp_create_token_mint_dialog.py`. The fix involves using the `mandatory_coins` parameter in the `make_unsigned_transaction` method to ensure correct output ordering.",
    "affected_versions": "< 3.6.2",
    "patched_versions": "3.6.2",
