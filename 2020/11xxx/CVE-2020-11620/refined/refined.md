  "CVE-2020-11620": {
    "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.4 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to org.apache.commons.jelly.impl.Embedded (aka commons-jelly).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the mishandling of serialization gadgets and typing within the FasterXML jackson-databind library. Specifically, when processing data, the library can be tricked into instantiating and utilizing malicious classes (gadgets) due to insecure polymorphic handling of types, particularly related to `org.apache.commons.jelly.impl.Embedded` (commons-jelly) class.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Mishandling of serialization gadgets",
      "Unsafe polymorphic type handling",
    ],
     "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send malicious JSON content to a system using jackson-databind where polymorphic type handling is enabled."
