{
  "CVE-2020-11046": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `update_read_synchronize` function in FreeRDP seeks the stream pointer without checking the stream's length. This can cause the stream pointer to go out of bounds.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stream out-of-bounds seek, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read later.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "An out-of-bounds seek can cause a crash or possibly lead to data corruption due to a later out-of-bounds read. The issue can also cause a session to terminate.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious RDP server can send a manipulated synchronize update message to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the RDP server."
