- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's `admin_post` action `c37_wpl_import_template` lacks nonce and capability checks, allowing unauthenticated users to import malicious templates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload a malicious template. If a licensed user imports the template and creates a page from it, malicious JavaScript will execute in their browser, potentially leading to site takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a `$_POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-post.php` with the `action` parameter set to `c37_wpl_import_template` and a `files_name[]` parameter containing a malicious template file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious page template. A licensed user with the plugin must import and use the malicious template to trigger the XSS.
