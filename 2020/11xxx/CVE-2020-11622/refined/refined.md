Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Arista CloudEOS VM / vEOS Router code when TCP MSS options are configured, specifically when `tcp mss ceiling` is used on a tunnel interface. A malformed TCP packet can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed TCP packets when `tcp mss ceiling` is configured.
- Failure to properly process or discard the corrupted TCP packet on the data plane.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to an impact on data plane traffic forwarding.
- A successful exploit may cause the forwarding process to hang or stop.
- If exploited, packet counters for active ports will not increase, indicating traffic forwarding is affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malformed TCP packet is sent over the data plane of an affected CloudEOS VM / vEOS Router instance where `tcp mss ceiling` is configured.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the data plane interface of a vulnerable CloudEOS VM / vEOS Router.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system, the attack is triggered by a specific crafted packet.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to craft TCP packets with specific malformations.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to CloudEOS VM / vEOS Router software and does not affect other Arista products like physical switches, routers, wireless access points, CloudVision appliances, CloudEOS containers, or Arista 7130 systems.
- The vulnerability can be detected by checking if "tcp mss ceiling" is configured on any interface and by observing if packet counters stop incrementing on active interfaces when using the CLI command provided.
- Mitigation involves restarting the SFE agent, which will interrupt data forwarding temporarily.
- A hotfix is provided as a patch, or upgrading to a fixed software version is the recommended resolution.
- The advisory provides specific fixed versions and special releases where the vulnerability is addressed.
- The provided hotfix, available as a `.swix` extension, can be applied to all vulnerable versions.
