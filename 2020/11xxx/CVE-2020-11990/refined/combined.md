**CVE-2020-11990:** Apache Cordova Plugin camera vulnerable to information disclosure

**Type of Vulnerability:**

CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

**Severity:** Low

**Vendor:** The Apache Software Foundation

**Possible attackers condition:**

An attacker who can install (or lead the victim to install) the specially crafted (or malicious) Android application. Android documentation describes the external cache location as application specific, however,
*"There is no security enforced with these files. For example, any application holding Manifest.permission.WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE can write to these files."*
( and thereby read )

**Possible victims:**

Android users that take pictures with an Apache Cordova based application and attached removable storage.

**Possible Impacts:**

* Confidentiality is breached.
* The image file (photo) taken by the Android apps that was developed using the Apache Cordova camera plugin will be disclosed.

**Versions Affected:**

Cordova Android applications using the Camera plugin

( cordova-plugin-camera version 4.1.0 and below )

**Upgrade path:**

Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version 5.0.0 or higher of cordova-plugin-camera

**Mitigation Steps:**

Upgrade plugin and rebuild application, update deployments.

Camera Plugin Released!
By:
Bryan Ellis

18 Sep 2020

We are happy to announce that we have just released an update to our camera plugin!

* [cordova-plugin-camera@5.0.0](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cordova-plugin-camera)

## Release Highlights

In this major release, we have:

* removed the `DestinationType` of `NATIVE_URI` that was used only in the iOS and Windows platform. For iOS, the `NATIVE_URI` returned an `ALAssetsLibrary` that had been deprecated and does not work with the `WKWevView`.
* removed the `CordovaUri` class helper that used fuzzy logic to guess the image path from the content URL. This process was not necessary as we know the file path beforehand.
* bumped the project requirement definition. This plugin version requires Cordova CLI >= 9.0.0. If building for Android, this plugin version will also require the Cordova Android platform >= 9.0.0.
* changed the location of the temporary saved images from external to internal cache.

# JVN#59779918 Apache Cordova Plugin camera vulnerable to information exposure

## Overview

Apache Cordova Plugin camera is vulnerable to information exposure.

## Products Affected

* Apache Cordova Plugin camera versions prior to 5.0.0

## Description

Apache Cordova Plugin camera is a plugin for Apache Cordova applications, which provides an API for taking pictures and for choosing images from the system image library.

Vulnerable versions of Apache Cordova Plugin camera, when used in Android applications, use the external storage on the device when available, as an image file cache. Any applications with permission READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE (or WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE also) can access these cache files([CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)).

On the source code repository, the commit to fix the vulnerability is done for version 4.2.0, but version 4.2.0 is not officially released. Hence the fixed version is 5.0.0.

## Impact

When a user is tricked into installing some malicious application to the Android device which has an external storage, and the user take a photo with the vulnerable application, then the image (photo) file is cached on the external storage. The malicious application may retrieve the file contents from the external storage.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Android cordova application with Cordova Plugin camera should be updated with that plugin version 5.0.0 or higher.

## Comment

The analysis assumes that the user is tricked into installing some malicious application on the device.

UI:R (User Interaction is Required) because the user should allow the application to access the external storage.
