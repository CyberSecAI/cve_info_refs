Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Apache Cordova Camera plugin, in versions 4.1.0 and below, when used in Android applications, stored temporary image files in the external storage (cache) of the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor:** The core issue is that the external storage location is not secured, allowing other applications with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions to access these cached image files.
- **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data:** The camera plugin did not use secure internal storage for temporary files, making them accessible to malicious applications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could gain access to images (photos) taken by the affected application.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive image data could be exposed to malicious apps on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application Installation:** An attacker needs to convince a user to install a malicious Android application on their device.
- **External Storage Access:** The malicious app leverages its `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions to access the cached image files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Install Applications:** The attacker must be able to have a malicious app installed on the victim's Android device.
- **Permissions:** The attacker's app must have the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions to access the external storage where the images are cached.
- **User Action:** The victim must use the vulnerable application to take a picture for an image to be stored in the insecure location.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Android applications using the Apache Cordova camera plugin, versions 4.1.0 and below.
- The fix was to change the location of temporary saved images from external to internal cache in plugin version 5.0.0.
- The external cache location is application-specific, however, there is no security enforced. Any app holding the storage permissions can write to these files and consequently, read them.

This vulnerability is considered low severity because it requires user interaction (installing a malicious application) and only exposes locally stored images.
