Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11005:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `NCryptDecrypt` static method within the WindowsHello library could be used by any executable to decrypt data encrypted by the same library. This circumvents the intended requirement of Windows Hello authentication for decryption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure direct object reference:** The library's decryption method (`NCryptDecrypt`) was publicly accessible and did not enforce proper access control mechanisms, allowing any executable to use it without proper authentication.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The decryption process did not require the use of Windows Hello authentication, which was the intended security mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could decrypt sensitive data encrypted using the vulnerable library without needing to use Windows Hello authentication.
*   **Circumvention of Security Measures:** The vulnerability allows for the complete bypass of the intended security mechanisms of the Windows Hello library.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could create a separate executable that uses the vulnerable library's `NCryptDecrypt` method to decrypt data that was previously encrypted by the same library and written to a file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the encrypted data (e.g., a text file containing encrypted content).
*   The attacker must be able to run their own executable on the target system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to utilize or include the vulnerable WindowsHello library in their malicious executable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical".
*   The affected versions of the library are <= 1.0.3, and the patched version is 1.0.4+.
*   There are no known workarounds.
*   The vulnerability was reported through a GitHub issue.
