Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv` plugin's insecure activation of virtual environments. Specifically, the plugin automatically sources the `activate` script within a `.venv` directory when a user enters a directory containing it. This allows an attacker to place a malicious `activate` script within a `.venv` directory and have it executed automatically when a user navigates into that directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The plugin directly sources the `activate` script without any validation of the path or content, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of User Interaction:** The script is sourced automatically upon entering a directory with a `.venv` folder, without the user's explicit consent or awareness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute any code within the context of the user's shell by placing a malicious `activate` script.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The malicious script can access sensitive information from the user's environment.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker could potentially escalate their privileges or compromise the entire system, depending on the permissions of the user executing the script.
*   **Silent Execution:** The malicious script can erase the "Switching virtualenv" message, making the user unaware that the script was executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious `.venv` Directories:** An attacker can create a repository or a directory containing a `.venv` folder with a malicious `activate` script, and convince users to navigate into it (e.g. via a git clone).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a directory or repository containing a malicious `.venv` directory.
*   The attacker needs to lure a user who has the vulnerable `zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv` plugin installed into navigating to this directory.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes:

*   A commit that addresses the vulnerability by implementing a `_validated_source` function to prevent sourcing paths with `..` in them, thus preventing access to arbitrary directories.
*   A test case added to verify the fix by ensuring that the vulnerable behaviour is blocked.
*   An issue report describing the vulnerability and an example of how to reproduce it.
*   A security advisory for the vulnerability with the CVE ID, GHSA-h8wm-cqq6-957q, and information on the affected and patched versions.
