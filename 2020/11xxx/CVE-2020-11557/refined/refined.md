This content provides detailed information about CVE-2020-11557 and other vulnerabilities in Castle Rock Computing's SNMPc Enterprise, specifically SNMPc OnLine 12.10.10 before 2020-01-28.

**CVE-2020-11557:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext username and password credentials exposed in cookies.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information, specifically user credentials, are stored in cookies without encryption.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can intercept and read the cookies to gain access to the application using the exposed credentials.
*  **Attack vectors:** Network sniffing/Man in the Middle.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the server.

The blog post also details other vulnerabilities and demonstrates how to chain CVE-2020-11556 (XSS), CVE-2020-11553 (CSRF), and CVE-2020-11555 (Unencrypted credentials in backup files) to gain full administrative control. This includes:

*   **CVE-2020-11556 (XSS):**  Stored XSS vulnerability exists in the "My Shortcuts" functionality. Arbitrary JavaScript code can be injected, leading to persistent code execution.
    *   **Attack vectors**: Malicious shortcut title.
    *   **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution in context of the victim user.
*   **CVE-2020-11553 (CSRF):** Lack of CSRF protection allows attackers to force an authenticated user to perform actions on the site. Demonstrated by changing the backup directory.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Attacker controlled webpage visited by victim.
    *   **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized modification of system settings.
*   **CVE-2020-11555 (Unencrypted credentials in backup files):**  Backup files contain sensitive information, including user credentials and SNMP community strings, in cleartext.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Access to the backup file.
    *   **Impact of exploitation**: Full access to the application and potentially to managed network devices.

**Chained Exploit:**

The author shows how to chain these vulnerabilities to gain full access to the system:
1.  Use XSS to inject code into the "My Shortcuts" page.
2.  The injected XSS will trigger a CSRF attack, forcing the victim's browser to change the backup directory to an attacker controlled SMB share.
3.  The attacker then forces a backup of the database to the SMB share.
4.  The attacker extracts credentials and sensitive information from the backup file.

This chained exploit allows an attacker to gain control of the NMS and the managed devices.
