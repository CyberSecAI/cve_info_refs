Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-11704:

**Content Analysis:**

The provided content includes a link to a GitHub repository that contains details of multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the ProVide Web Admin Interface. These vulnerabilities are located in the "Web Admin Interface" of ProVide server.

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `GetInheritedProperties`:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS vulnerability in the GetInheritedProperties parameter.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the `GetInheritedProperties` parameter. When a victim clicks on the crafted URL, the malicious script will be executed in their browser.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `GetUserInfo`:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS vulnerability in the GetUserInfo parameter.
    *    **Attack Vector:** Similar to the above, an attacker crafts a malicious URL using the `GetUserInfo` parameter. If a victim clicks on this URL, the XSS payload is executed.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `SetUserInfo`:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability in the SetUserInfo parameter.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious script through the SetUserInfo function. This script is then stored on the server. When a victim accesses the affected page, the stored script executes within their browser.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the ProVide Web Admin Interface. The application fails to neutralize the special characters that are part of malicious scripts before including them in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, or other data from the victim's browser.
*   **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could use XSS to hijack a user's session.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site or inject malware by leveraging the XSS.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers can use XSS to alter the appearance of web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** For reflected XSS, attackers craft malicious URLs and trick users into clicking them.
*   **Direct Input Injection:** For stored XSS, attackers inject malicious code directly through input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Attackers need to be able to craft malicious URLs and socially engineer users into clicking them.
*   **Stored XSS:** Attackers need to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application. This would require access to the admin interface, or an alternative method of inserting data, depending on the affected parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The identified vulnerabilities are specific to the ProVide Web Admin Interface.
*   The github content suggests that there are multiple cross-site scripting issues
*   The `readme.md` file in the repository redirects to `https://belong2yourself.github.io/vulnerabilities/`, suggesting this might be part of a larger collection of vulnerabilities.

**CVE Relevance**

While the provided content doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2020-11704, the presence of multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the ProVide Web Admin Interface strongly suggests a link, and this could be the root cause of the CVE, since the description of CVE-2020-11704 is missing.
