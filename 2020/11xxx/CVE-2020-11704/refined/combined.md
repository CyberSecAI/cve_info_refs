# Is ProVide really that secure?

1 min read

In short, YES! Our secure server is equipped with a number of anti-hammer methods, impersonation (threads run with the permissions of a specific user), extensive logging and not to mention support for both FTPS (TLS/SSL) as well as SFTP (v3-v6) and support for a wide range of encryption algorithms as well as self signed or purchased certificates: It is secure! We also have several research labs, government organisations, Fortune 500 companies, defence contractors as well as payment transaction firms using ProVide. And of course with more than 3 Million downloads a few others to!

**Perfect score at Qualys SSL Labs official test**

After implementing the following in ProVide it is now possible to configure the server to achieve a perfect score at Qualys SSL Labs official test.

* Implemented support for HTTP Strict Transport Security.
* Implemented support to individually enable/disable SSL/TLS protocols (SSL v2, SSL v3, TLS v1, TLS v1.1, TLS v1.2).
* Implemented support for forward secrecy with most browsers.
* Improved support for completely loading chain certificates including intermediate.
* Improved support for individually enable/disable SSL/TLS ciphers.
* Improved support for renegotiation (allow secure, disable client-initiated).

![SSL-labs_A provide server](https://usercontent.one/wp/www.provideserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SSL-labs_A-1.png?media=1733155702)

**Requirements**

* Latest version of ProVide
* Purchased certificate with at least 4096 bit key using SHA256 encryption (not SHA1)
