  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-11979",
    "description": "Ant is an embedded dependency included in the Gradle distribution. We've upgraded to the latest Ant release to fix a vulnerability with temporary files. As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissions of temporary files it created so that only the current user was allowed to access them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file and created a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying the effort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.",
    "root_cause": "The fixcrlf task in Apache Ant deletes a temporary file and creates a new one without the proper security protections, undoing the fix for CVE-2020-1945.",

      "Insecure temporary file creation",
       "Permissions not set correctly on temporary files",
       "symlink attack vulnerability"
