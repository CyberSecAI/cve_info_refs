Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11737:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2020-11737 in the Zimbra blog and wiki, confirming its relevance. The description is "XSS through malicious JS embedded in Mail Message or Calendar Event." This matches the provided information.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input within email messages or calendar events, specifically when rendering or processing JavaScript. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that could then be executed in the context of a user's web browser when they view the compromised email or calendar entry.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, specifically a persistent or stored XSS vulnerability, because the malicious JavaScript is embedded within the email message or calendar event and stored.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session when they view the email or calendar event.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.
*   **Data Theft:**  The attacker could potentially steal data or sensitive information accessible by the victim's account
*   **Phishing/Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the user to malicious sites or download malware.
*   **Defacement/Modification:** An attacker could modify the web interface and change the appearance of the email client or calendar.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Messages:** Attackers embed malicious JavaScript within the content of email messages.
*   **Calendar Events:** Attackers embed malicious JavaScript within the content or parameters of calendar events.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Emails or Calendar Invites:** The attacker must be able to send emails or create calendar invites that contain the malicious JavaScript.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system, as the attack is primarily a client-side attack on the user's browser.
*   **Victim Interaction Required:** The victim needs to open or view the crafted email or calendar event for the XSS payload to execute.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content indicates a fix was released in Zimbra 9.0.0 Patch 2.
* The CVSS score of 3.1 indicates a "Minor" severity.
