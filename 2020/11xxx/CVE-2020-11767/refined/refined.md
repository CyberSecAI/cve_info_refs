Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2020-11767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of HTTP/2 connection reuse in scenarios involving multiple servers with overlapping certificates on the same IP address. Specifically, when a client reuses an existing HTTP/2 connection that was initially established with a server using a wildcard certificate, requests intended for a different server with a specific non-wildcard certificate on the same IP may be incorrectly routed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Violation of HTTP/2 RFC 7540:** The primary weakness is the failure to adhere to HTTP/2 RFC 7540, specifically sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. These sections mandate that if a request arrives on a connection that's not intended for the origin server, the server MUST respond with a 421 (Misdirected Request) status code. Envoy was not sending the 421 error.
*   **Incorrect Connection Reuse:** Envoy and Istio incorrectly reuse connections, potentially sending requests to the wrong backend server. This occurs when multiple servers share an IP and use TLS certificates, which could lead to misdirection of requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Disruption:** Users may encounter 404 errors or other incorrect responses because requests are routed to the wrong service.
*   **Inconsistent Behavior:** The inconsistent behavior across browsers and the need to clear browser caches suggests a client-side workaround for a server-side issue.
*   **Potential for Data Exposure/Corruption:** Although not explicitly stated, misrouting could potentially expose or corrupt data if different servers have different data expectations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP/2 Connection Reuse:** The attack vector exploits the connection reuse mechanism in HTTP/2. This involves establishing a connection to a wildcard certificate server then making a request for a different server.
*   **Multiple Servers on Same IP:** The vulnerability relies on the presence of multiple servers on the same IP address, with one using a wildcard certificate and another a non-wildcard certificate.
*   **SNI (Server Name Indication):** The vulnerability is triggered when the initial connection is made to a server based on the wildcard certificate, and subsequent requests using the same connection are sent to a server that requires a specific SNI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Initiate HTTP/2 Connections:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate HTTP/2 connections. This is typically a client capability (e.g., a web browser).
*   **Knowledge of Server Topology:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the server topology: specifically, which servers use wildcard vs. specific certificates and that they share an IP.
*   **Ability to make subsequent requests after the initial connection:** After the initial connection, the attacker must then attempt to make a request to another server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue was initially reported against Chromium, then Istio, and finally identified as a bug in Envoy.
*   The fix involves sending a 421 response when a request is misdirected due to connection reuse.
*   The issue highlights a deviation from the HTTP/2 RFC specifications by Envoy.
*   The GitHub issues provide a detailed example of reproducing the bug by setting up multiple gateways using wildcard and specific certificates.

In summary, the content describes a vulnerability related to improper HTTP/2 connection reuse and failure to adhere to RFC 7540, leading to request misdirection and service disruption.
