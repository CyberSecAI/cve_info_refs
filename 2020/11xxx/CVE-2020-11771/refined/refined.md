This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router and gateway models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the firmware of the affected Netgear devices. Specific details of the vulnerable code/functionality are not provided, but the vulnerability is located within the router/gateway's web interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into data stored on the affected devices. When a user views the stored data through the web interface, the malicious script executes in their browser.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    -  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when viewing the interface of the vulnerable device. This could potentially allow an attacker to:
        - Steal session cookies, potentially leading to account compromise.
        - Deface the web interface of the router.
        - Redirect users to malicious websites.
        - Perform actions on behalf of the user within the router interface.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the persistent storage (likely the router's configuration) of the affected devices. The precise vector is not detailed, but this typically involves submitting crafted input to a vulnerable form field or configuration parameter. Once the malicious script is stored, it is executed whenever another user interacts with the affected element.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  The attacker needs to have access to the device's web interface. This may be facilitated by local network access or remote access via port forwarding.
    - The attacker needs to be able to submit data to a vulnerable input field. This requires the attacker to be at least a logged in user.
    -  The attack requires high privileges as the CVSS vector specifies that the attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) to be able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products/Firmware:**
*   D7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
*   R7500v2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
*   R7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.68
*   R8900, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
*   R9000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
*   RAX120, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78
*   XR500, firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.56
*   XR700, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.10

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is identified as PSV-2018-0519 in Netgear's internal tracking.
* Netgear recommends updating to the latest firmware version.
* The CVSS v3 score is 6.0 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
