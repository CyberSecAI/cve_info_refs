- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AMI BMC firmware in NVIDIA DGX servers allows an attacker to upload or transfer files that can be automatically processed, leading to potential code execution. This is due to insufficient validation or sanitization of the uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload leading to code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the BMC of the DGX server, file upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the BMC and ability to upload a malicious file. User interaction is required (UI:R).
