## Description

![@oldkingcone](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11233163?u=9552796bf25077c8543355f48d59d87170f30f31&v=4&size=48)[oldkingcone](https://github.com/oldkingcone)opened [on Mar 30, 2020](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/16056#issue-589932745)
### Describe the bug

The login form does not properly escape CRLF sequences, this can lead to HTML entity injection at the very least, or reflected XSS at the very worst.

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to 'index.php'
2. Insert into the login fields, username, password, and the hidden field of target, and insert this value into those fields: %0D%0Astring%0D%0A and the login error will display the injected CRLF sequences, and injected url encoded entities, such as single or double quotes(double quotes are not as effective as single quotes).

### Expected behavior

I expected the application to drop/filter out the CRLF sequences seeing as an issue similar was detected back in 2005.
