Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-11937:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `parse_report` function within the `whoopsie` daemon incorrectly handles memory when parsing crash files. Specifically, a memory leak occurs due to improper handling of the GHashTable data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** When parsing a crash report, `whoopsie` uses a GHashTable to store key-value pairs from the crash file. If the crash file contains duplicate keys, the old value associated with the key is replaced with the new value using `g_hash_table_insert()`. However, `whoopsie` doesn't free the old value when this collision happens, leading to a memory leak. This is because the `key_destroy_func` and `value_destroy_func` parameters are not provided when creating the GHashTable via `g_hash_table_new()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious crash file with repetitive key-value pairs. When `whoopsie` parses this file, it consumes excessive amounts of memory, eventually triggering the Linux kernel's OOM (Out-Of-Memory) killer. The OOM killer terminates the `whoopsie` process and potentially other processes, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be able to create and place a malicious crash file on the local system. The attacker would then need to trigger the `whoopsie` daemon to parse the file. This could be done by crashing an application which uses apport to report the error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to write files to the local system and trigger the `whoopsie` daemon to parse a crafted crash file, typically by causing an application to crash.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `whoopsie.c`.
*   The fix involves using `g_hash_table_new_full()` instead of `g_hash_table_new()` when creating the GHashTable.  The new function requires `key_destroy_func` and `value_destroy_func` to handle memory deallocation. Another alternative is to check for collisions before inserting new values by using `g_hash_table_lookup_extended()`, and removing the old value.
*   The provided exploit PoC, `whoopsie_killer.py`, generates a malformed crash file with repetitive key-value pairs to trigger the memory leak.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Seong-Joong Kim.
