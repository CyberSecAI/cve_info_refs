The provided content relates to CVE-2020-11872, specifically addressing the vulnerability described within issue #7 of the `opentrace-cloud-functions` repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Incorrect Initialization Vector (IV) handling for AES-256-GCM encryption. The current implementation does not adhere to NIST Special Publication 800-38D, specifically sections 8.2 and 8.3 regarding IV construction and constraints on the number of invocations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Non-deterministic IVs:** The current implementation likely doesn't use a deterministic method for generating IVs as recommended in NIST SP 800-38D section 8.2.1, potentially leading to IV reuse.
-   **Key reuse:** The same encryption key might be used for more than 2^32 operations, violating the constraints mentioned in NIST SP 800-38D section 8.3.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An adversary could potentially fabricate IDs or Upload Tokens if they manage to collect duplicate IVs or if the same key is used for more than 2^32 encryption operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- By observing or intercepting communication, an attacker can attempt to collect duplicate IVs used for encryption.
- An attacker might attempt to exploit the vulnerability of a key that has been used for more than 2^32 encryption operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or observe encrypted data to collect used IVs.
- The attacker needs some means to understand how the keys are used within the system to identify potential key reuse situations.
