The provided content relates to CVE-2020-11894.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `decompileIF` function within `decompile.c` at line 2473.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `decompileIF` function due to out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the application (swftocxx).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted and exploited

**Attack vectors:**
- By processing a specially crafted SWF file (`segmentaion_fault_decompile_569-out_of_bound-idx.0x1199-0xb.zip`) with the `swftocxx` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SWF file to the `swftocxx` utility for processing.
