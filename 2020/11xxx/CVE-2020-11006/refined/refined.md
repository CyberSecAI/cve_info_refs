  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, user-provided data could be injected into the database and later executed when retrieved from the backend. Some endpoints were also vulnerable to reflected XSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input sanitization on POST, PUT, and GET requests.",
      "Reflected XSS vulnerabilities in certain endpoints."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious XSS payloads that would be executed when the data is fetched from the backend, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability could be exploited through various forms of XSS injection via POST, PUT and GET requests.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints containing malicious XSS payloads. This could be achieved by an authenticated user or, in the case of reflected XSS, a user that can be tricked into clicking a malicious link."
