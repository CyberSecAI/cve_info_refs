Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw in the "Test Web Service" functionality of MicroStrategy Web 10.4 and possibly later versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows an attacker to make requests to arbitrary servers from the application server.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The "Test Web Service" functionality does not require authentication.
- **Limited Request Customization:** While arbitrary schemes and parameters cannot be passed in the SSRF request, the vulnerability can still be exploited for port scanning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Port Scanning:** An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to enumerate resources within the network by conducting port scans. This allows them to discover IP addresses and services exposed on the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending requests to the "Test Web Service" functionality located at `/MicroStrategyWS/`.
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint, causing the server to make a request to a different destination.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the MicroStrategy Web server.
- No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
