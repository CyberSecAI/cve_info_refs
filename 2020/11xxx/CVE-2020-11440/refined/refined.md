Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-11440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `httpRpmFs` component of the WebCLI in Wind River VxWorks.
- It stems from a lack of proper input validation that allows an attacker to escape the intended web root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The lack of input sanitization allows the attacker to manipulate file paths, potentially accessing files and directories outside of the web root. This is also known as "Directory Traversal".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the system, including configuration files and other sensitive data.
- **Code Injection:** The attacker might be able to upload malicious files, depending on system configuration, which could lead to code execution and complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface (WebCLI):** The attack vector is through the web interface (WebCLI) of VxWorks, specifically the `httpRpmFs` component.
- **Malicious File Path:** An attacker would craft malicious file paths that include sequences like "../" to escape the web root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system's WebCLI interface.
- **No Authentication Specified**: The description does not specify whether authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Wind River VxWorks versions 5.5 through 7 SR0640.
- It is marked as a "MEDIUM" priority by Wind River, and CVSS v3 score of 7.5 and a CVSS v2 score of "HIGH".
- Fixes are available in VxWorks 7 SR0650, and VxWorks 6.9.4.12 RCPL1.
- Other products like Wind River Linux, Helix Virtualization Platform Cert Edition, and eLxr are not affected.
