Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-11001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper HTML escaping in the page revision comparison view within the Wagtail admin interface. Specifically, user-supplied content within StreamField blocks was not being sanitized when displayed in the revision comparison.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious HTML or JavaScript code could be injected through the revision history and executed within the context of a privileged user's browser when they viewed the comparison.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system failed to properly escape or sanitize user input when rendering the differences in StreamField block content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged Wagtail admin user (e.g. an editor) could craft a malicious page revision. When a higher-privileged user (e.g. an administrator) views this malicious revision, the injected script could execute with the higher-privileged user's credentials.
- **Malicious Actions:**  The attacker could perform actions in the application as the higher-privileged user including creating a new administrator account, modifying data, etc..
- The impact is limited to users with access to the Wagtail admin interface. Ordinary site visitors are not vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Wagtail Admin Interface:** The attack vector is through the Wagtail admin interface, specifically the page revision comparison view.
- **Maliciously Crafted Revisions:**  Attackers inject malicious code by crafting specific page revisions, typically by adding or modifying StreamField blocks containing script code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Wagtail Admin Access:** The attacker must have an account with at least limited-permission access to the Wagtail admin panel.
- **Content Editing Capability:** The attacker must have the ability to create and edit page content, including the ability to use StreamField blocks
- **Target a Privileged User:**  The attack requires a higher-privileged user to view the maliciously created revision in the Wagtail admin panel.

**Mitigation:**
- **Upgrading Wagtail:** The vulnerability was addressed in Wagtail versions 2.7.2 (LTS 2.7 branch) and 2.8.1 (2.8 branch) which include the fix for proper HTML escaping.
- **Workaround:** Site owners unable to upgrade immediately can disable the revision comparison view by adding a redirect in their `urls.py` file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Vlad Gerasimenko.
- The fix involved changes to `wagtail/admin/compare.py` to ensure proper escaping of user-supplied content when rendering StreamField blocks.
- The changes include escaping raw HTML, text, and char blocks, and stripping HTML tags from rich text blocks to prevent script execution when comparing revisions.
- The commit `61045ceefea114c40ac4b680af58990dbe732389` on GitHub contains the code changes that address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v4 base score of 4.6, with a moderate severity rating.
