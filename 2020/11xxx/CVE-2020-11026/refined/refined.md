Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-11026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from the ability to upload files with specially crafted names to the Media section of WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a lack of proper sanitization or validation of file names during the upload process. This allows for the creation of filenames that can be interpreted as executable scripts.
- This leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows for the execution of arbitrary scripts within the context of a user's browser when the uploaded file is accessed.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the Media upload functionality within WordPress.
- An attacker uploads a file with a crafted name designed to execute code when accessed.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an authenticated user accesses the uploaded file, causing the malicious script to execute in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privileges required to upload files to the media library. This typically involves a user with author-level or higher permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects WordPress versions 3.7 to 5.4.
- The vulnerability was patched in WordPress version 5.4.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ronnie Goodrich ([Kahoots](https://hackerone.com/kahoots)) and Jason Medeiros ([http://pentestusa.com/](http://pentestusa.com/)).
- The fix involves sanitizing filenames to prevent the execution of scripts within the browser.
