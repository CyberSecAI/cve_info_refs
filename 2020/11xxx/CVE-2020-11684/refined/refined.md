Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Content Description:**

The provided content includes a commit from the `linux4sam/at91bootstrap` repository on GitHub and a blog page from F-Secure. The GitHub commit focuses on changes made to the `secure.c` and `secure.h` files, involving moving cryptographic keys into static arrays. The F-Secure blog content is a general feed of their "Threats & Research" category and does not contain specific information about any CVE.

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided information from the GitHub commit does **NOT** relate to a specific CVE. It describes a code refactoring change, where the location of where cryptographic keys are stored is changed from stack to static memory. There is no mention of any specific vulnerability being addressed or introduced. 

**Analysis of the GitHub commit:**

*   **Root Cause of the Change:** The commit aims to improve the handling of cryptographic keys. The previous implementation copied keys from the code section to the stack during initialization. This change moves the keys to static arrays, which are placed in the data section at compile time.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present (Before the change):** The commit message implies a potential weakness in the previous implementation: the keys were being copied to the stack during initialization. The commit message doesn't say this causes a direct vulnerability, but moving them out of the stack can improve security, particularly against stack-based attacks or analysis. There is no clear vulnerability described.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The commit message does not mention an impact of exploitation, since the previous implementation was not necessarily vulnerable, but this change enhances security by ensuring that keys are placed in the data segment and can be wiped after use.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The commit message does not mention any attack vectors.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: No attacker capabilities are mentioned because there is no description of a vulnerability being fixed.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis of the provided information, this content is **UNRELATED** to any specific CVE, particularly CVE-2020-11684. The commit describes a code refactor for improved security and memory handling of cryptographic keys. The blog content is also unrelated.
