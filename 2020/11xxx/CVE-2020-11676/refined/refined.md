Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-11676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities within the Cerner medico hospital information management system.
*   Specifically, the `slim_proxy.c`, `dpscrypt.c`, `ntmkcr.c`, and `mkdict.c` files are identified as containing vulnerable code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflows:**
    *   In `slim_proxy.c`, the `showInode()` function copies the result of `iso2utf()` into a fixed-size buffer of 500 bytes, while `iso2utf()` could produce up to 1000 bytes of output.
    *  In `dpscrypt.c`, command-line arguments and environment variables are copied into fixed-size buffers using `strcpy()` without bounds checking.
    * In `mkdict.c`, an environment variable is copied into a 30-byte buffer using `strcpy()` without any boundary checks.
*   **Format String Vulnerabilities:**
    *   In `ntmkcr.c`, the `mod_key_opts()` function uses the variable `opt_string` as both source and destination in a `sprintf()` call.
    *   In `mkdict.c`, the `mask_tick()` function uses the variable `sbuf` as both source and destination in a `sprintf()` call.
*   **Data Corruption:**
    *   The `refreshList()` function in `slim_proxy.c` uses an uninitialized variable `output`.
*   **Broken Cryptography:**
    *   The `dpscrypt.c` utility and `crypt.cpp` file utilize the broken DES encryption algorithm.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**
    *   The `write_csvfile()` function in `mkdict.c` does not escape field delimiters (semicolons) which could lead to data injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take complete control of the software.
*   This could lead to data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive patient information, and potentially system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The advisory states that the attack vector is an "Adjacent Network", which means that the attacker would need to be on the same network as the vulnerable system. However, it also mentions that vulnerabilities may be reachable by a local user or through the network, depending on how the vulnerable components are used by other tools within the system.
*   The `slim_proxy` process was observed listening on the network. Exploiting the identified vulnerabilities in the `slim_proxy.c` would allow network based exploitation
*   Some vulnerabilities, such as those in `mkdict.c`, might be exploitable by a local user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be on the adjacent network to exploit the `slim_proxy` related vulnerabilities.
*   For local exploitation, the attacker would need some form of access to the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory mentions that the code quality is considered poor.
*   Mitigations such as stack canaries, FORTIFY\_SOURCE, RELRO, and PIE were not enabled in the compiled binaries.
*   The advisory also notes that the provided source files are not the complete software, thus the reachability of the vulnerabilities cannot be completely determined.
*   Patches were released to mitigate the issues (Defect 226386, Hotfix H26001200000).
