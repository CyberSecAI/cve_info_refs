Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application lacks proper authorization checks, allowing a low-privileged user to access and execute functionality intended for administrators. Specifically, a low-privileged user can directly call the `/Administration/Users/Edit/:ID` endpoint, which is meant for modifying user roles, without the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. The application does not verify if the user has the required privileges to execute the `POST` request to modify user roles. This allows a low-privileged user to perform actions they are not supposed to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can promote their own account to the Administrator role.
*   **Data Manipulation:** By gaining admin privileges, attackers can then modify other user accounts, modify the application's settings, and potentially gain further access to other resources within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific `POST` request to the `/Administration/Users/Edit/:ID` endpoint. This request modifies the user's role, promoting the low-privileged user to an administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid, low-privileged account on the affected system.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the correct endpoint to send the `POST` request as well as the format for the request body.
*   **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs the ability to send the crafted HTTP `POST` request. This could be done with a tool such as `curl` or a web browser's developer tools.
