Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11945:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content from `www.suse.com_12fea364_20250119_140511.html` directly references CVE-2020-11945 and includes a description that matches the official CVE description which states: *"A remote attacker can replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. This occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter (a short integer). Remote code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of replayed as valid credentials)."*

The other files are either UNRELATED or provide additional info on other CVEs.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the nonce reference counter within Squid's Digest Authentication implementation.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**
    *   The nonce reference counter is a short integer, which can be overflowed by a remote attacker.
    *   Improper handling of Digest Authentication tokens.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credential Replay:** A remote attacker can replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to protected resources.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If memory pooling is disabled, an attacker might achieve RCE when the pooled token credentials are freed rather than being replayed. This indicates a use-after-free scenario.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A remote attacker with network access to the affected Squid instance.
    *   The attacker must be able to sniff network traffic and capture a valid Digest Authentication nonce.
    *   The attacker replays the sniffed nonce to access resources.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network proximity to monitor traffic between clients and the vulnerable Squid proxy.
    *   Ability to sniff network traffic.
    *   Ability to send crafted HTTP requests.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `authDigestNonceLink()` function within Squid, where the counter is incremented without proper bounds checking.
*   The vulnerability can lead to a use-after-free condition.
*   The fix involves changing the counter to a 64-bit unsigned integer, making overflows impractical.

**Content that provides more details than the official CVE description:**

*   The Suse advisory includes a CVSS v3 score, which is higher than the CVSS v2 score
*   The Suse advisory mentions that if memory pooling is disabled in Squid, the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution.
*   The Suse advisory also specifies that the attacker can gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden by replaying the sniffed nonce.
*   The Fedora advisory highlights the fix in squid-4.11 to address the described improper access restriction upon digest authentication nonce replay that could lead to RCE.

**Additional Note:** The `lists.fedoraproject.org_68c1689b_20250119_122636.html` and `lists.fedoraproject.org_eb15ec6d_20250119_122635.html` show the fix in squid-4.11 and the associated CVE. `security.gentoo.org_6c0fb4e9_20250119_122636.html` and `bugs.gentoo.org_b3b01205_20250119_140452.html` also show that the affected Squid version is <4.11 and the vulnerability is resolved in versions >=4.11.
