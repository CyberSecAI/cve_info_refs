# USN-4382-1: FreeRDP vulnerabilities

4 June 2020

Several security issues were fixed in FreeRDP.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [freerdp](/security/cves?package=freerdp) - RDP client for Windows Terminal Services

## Details

It was discovered that FreeRDP incorrectly handled certain memory

operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause FreeRDP to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A âPersonal Accountâ represents an individual Userâs authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a Userâs identity on GitHub. âOrganizationsâ are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The âAgreementâ refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the âTerms of Serviceâ or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. âContentâ refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. âUser-Generated Contentâ is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. âGitHub,â âWe,â and âUsâ refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The âServiceâ refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. âThe User,â âYou,â and âYourâ refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The âWebsiteâ refers to GitHubâs website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHubâs conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organizationâs data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that Userâs Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your countryâs minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your countryâs laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person â i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us â and other GitHub Users â certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 â D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 â D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statementâfor security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service.

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isnât available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, itâs important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHubâs confidential information (collectively, âConfidential Informationâ), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the âPurposeâ), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we donât otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

Weâre always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, âFeedbackâ), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.

If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form.

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service âas isâ and âas available,â without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneysâ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important â we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

## [R. Miscellaneous](#r-miscellaneous)

### [1. Governing Law](#1-governing-law)

Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.

### [2. Non-Assignability](#2-non-assignability)

GitHub may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy), in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, including the license grant in Section D.4. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.

### [3. Section Headings and Summaries](#3-section-headings-and-summaries)

Throughout this Agreement, each section includes titles and brief summaries of the following terms and conditions. These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.

### [4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival](#4-severability-no-waiver-and-survival)

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the partiesâ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

### [5. Amendments; Complete Agreement](#5-amendments-complete-agreement)

This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised version in accordance with [Section Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms). These Terms of Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these terms including any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements.

Debian Bug     : 965979 1051638

Multiple vulnerabilties have been found in freelrdp2, a free
implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
The vulnerabilties potentially allows buffer overreads, buffer overflows,
interger overflows, use-after-free, DoS vectors.

CVE-2020-4030

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out of bounds read in
    TrioParse. Logging might bypass string length checks due to an
    integer overflow. This is fixed in version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-4031

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is a use-after-free in
    gdi_SelectObject. All FreeRDP clients using compatibility mode with
    /relax-order-checks are affected. This is fixed in version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-4032

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an integer casting
    vulnerability in update_recv_secondary_order. All clients with
    +glyph-cache /relax-order-checks are affected. This is fixed in
    version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-4033

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out of bounds read in
    RLEDECOMPRESS. All FreeRDP based clients with sessions with color
    depth < 32 are affected. This is fixed in version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-11017

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, by providing manipulated
    input a malicious client can create a double free condition and
    crash the server. This is fixed in version 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11018

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, a possible resource
    exhaustion vulnerability can be performed. Malicious clients could
    trigger out of bound reads causing memory allocation with random
    size. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11019

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, when running with logger set
    to "WLOG_TRACE", a possible crash of application could occur due to
    a read of an invalid array index. Data could be printed as string to
    local terminal. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11038

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, an Integer Overflow to
    Buffer Overflow exists. When using /video redirection, a manipulated
    server can instruct the client to allocate a buffer with a smaller
    size than requested due to an integer overflow in size calculation.
    With later messages, the server can manipulate the client to write
    data out of bound to the previously allocated buffer. This has been
    patched in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11039

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, when using a manipulated
    server with USB redirection enabled (nearly) arbitrary memory can be
    read and written due to integer overflows in length checks. This has
    been patched in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11040

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound
    data read from memory in clear_decompress_subcode_rlex, visualized
    on screen as color. This has been patched in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11041

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, an outside controlled array
    index is used unchecked for data used as configuration for sound
    backend (alsa, oss, pulse, ...). The most likely outcome is a crash
    of the client instance followed by no or distorted sound or a
    session disconnect. If a user cannot upgrade to the patched version,
    a workaround is to disable sound for the session. This has been
    patched in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11042

    In FreeRDP greater than 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an
    out-of-bounds read in update_read_icon_info. It allows reading a
    attacker-defined amount of client memory (32bit unsigned -> 4GB) to
    an intermediate buffer. This can be used to crash the client or
    store information for later retrieval. This has been patched in
    2.0.0.

CVE-2020-11043

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds
    read in rfx_process_message_tileset. Invalid data fed to RFX decoder
    results in garbage on screen (as colors). This has been patched in
    2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11044

    In FreeRDP greater than 1.2 and before 2.0.0, a double free in
    update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order crashes the client application if
    corrupted data from a manipulated server is parsed. This has been
    patched in 2.0.0.

CVE-2020-11045

    In FreeRDP after 1.0 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound read
    in in update_read_bitmap_data that allows client memory to be read
    to an image buffer. The result displayed on screen as colour.

CVE-2020-11046

    In FreeRDP after 1.0 and before 2.0.0, there is a stream
    out-of-bounds seek in update_read_synchronize that could lead to a
    later out-of-bounds read.

CVE-2020-11047

    In FreeRDP after 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds
    read in autodetect_recv_bandwidth_measure_results. A malicious
    server can extract up to 8 bytes of client memory with a manipulated
    message by providing a short input and reading the measurement
    result data. This has been patched in 2.0.0.

CVE-2020-11048

    In FreeRDP after 1.0 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds
    read. It only allows to abort a session. No data extraction is
    possible. This has been fixed in 2.0.0.

CVE-2020-11049

    In FreeRDP after 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound read
    of client memory that is then passed on to the protocol parser. This
    has been patched in 2.0.0.

CVE-2020-11058

    In FreeRDP after 1.1 and before 2.0.0, a stream out-of-bounds seek
    in rdp_read_font_capability_set could lead to a later out-of-bounds
    read. As a result, a manipulated client or server might force a
    disconnect due to an invalid data read. This has been fixed in
    2.0.0.

CVE-2020-11085

    In FreeRDP before 2.1.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in
    cliprdr_read_format_list. Clipboard format data read (by client or
    server) might read data out-of-bounds. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11086

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound
    read in ntlm_read_ntlm_v2_client_challenge that reads up to 28 bytes
    out-of-bound to an internal structure. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11087

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound
    read in ntlm_read_AuthenticateMessage. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11088

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound
    read in ntlm_read_NegotiateMessage. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11089

    In FreeRDP before 2.1.0, there is an out-of-bound read in irp
    functions (parallel_process_irp_create, serial_process_irp_create,
    drive_process_irp_write, printer_process_irp_write, rdpei_recv_pdu,
    serial_process_irp_write). This has been fixed in 2.1.0.

CVE-2020-11095

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, an out of bound reads occurs
    resulting in accessing a memory location that is outside of the
    boundaries of the static array PRIMARY_DRAWING_ORDER_FIELD_BYTES.
    This is fixed in version 2.1.2

CVE-2020-11096

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is a global OOB read in
    update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order. As a workaround, one can disable
    bitmap cache with -bitmap-cache (default). This is fixed in version
    2.1.2.

CVE-2020-11097

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, an out of bounds read occurs
    resulting in accessing a memory location that is outside of the
    boundaries of the static array PRIMARY_DRAWING_ORDER_FIELD_BYTES.
    This is fixed in version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-11098

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out-of-bound read in
    glyph_cache_put. This affects all FreeRDP clients with
    `+glyph-cache` option enabled This is fixed in version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-11099

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out of bounds read in
    license_read_new_or_upgrade_license_packet. A manipulated license
    packet can lead to out of bound reads to an internal buffer. This is
    fixed in version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-13396

    In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out of bounds read in
    license_read_new_or_upgrade_license_packet. A manipulated license
    packet can lead to out of bound reads to an internal buffer. This is
    fixed in version 2.1.2.

CVE-2020-13397

    An issue was discovered in FreeRDP before 2.1.1. An out-of-bounds
    (OOB) read vulnerability has been detected in security_fips_decrypt
    in libfreerdp/core/security.c due to an uninitialized value.

CVE-2020-13398

    An issue was discovered in FreeRDP before 2.1.1. An out-of-bounds
    (OOB) write vulnerability has been detected in crypto_rsa_common in
    libfreerdp/crypto/crypto.c.

CVE-2020-15103

    In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.1.2, an integer overflow exists
    due to missing input sanitation in rdpegfx channel. All FreeRDP
    clients are affected. The input rectangles from the server are not
    checked against local surface coordinates and blindly accepted. A
    malicious server can send data that will crash the client later on
    (invalid length arguments to a `memcpy`) This has been fixed in
    2.2.0. As a workaround, stop using command line arguments /gfx,
    /gfx-h264 and /network:auto

CVE-2023-39350

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. This issue affects Clients
    only. Integer underflow leading to DOS (e.g. abort due to
    `WINPR_ASSERT` with default compilation flags). When an insufficient
    blockLen is provided, and proper length validation is not performed,
    an Integer Underflow occurs, leading to a Denial of Service (DOS)
    vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and
    3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-39351

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions of
    FreeRDP are subject to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in
    the RemoteFX (rfx) handling. Inside the
    `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the program allocates tiles
    using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of numTiles. If the
    initialization process of tiles is not completed for various
    reasons, tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed in
    further processing and would cause a program crash. This issue has
    been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised
    to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-39352

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound
    Write. This can be triggered when the values `rect->left` and
    `rect->top` are exactly equal to `surface->width` and
    `surface->height`. eg. `rect->left` == `surface->width` &&
    `rect->top` == `surface->height`. In practice this should cause a
    crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and
    3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-39353

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to a missing offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Read.
    In the `libfreerdp/codec/rfx.c` file there is no offset validation
    in `tile->quantIdxY`, `tile->quantIdxCb`, and `tile->quantIdxCr`. As
    a result crafted input can lead to an out of bounds read access
    which in turn will cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in
    versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There
    are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-39354

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `nsc_rle_decompress_data`
    function. The Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because it processes
    `context->Planes` without checking if it contains data of sufficient
    length. Should an attacker be able to leverage this vulnerability
    they may be able to cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in
    versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There
    are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-39355

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Versions of FreeRDP on the
    3.x release branch before beta3 are subject to a Use-After-Free in
    processing `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packets. If
    `context->maxPlaneSize` is 0, `context->planesBuffer` will be freed.
    However, without updating `context->planesBuffer`, this leads to a
    Use-After-Free exploit vector. In most environments this should only
    result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in version
    3.0.0-beta3 and users of the beta 3.x releases are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-39356

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. In affected versions a
    missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of Bound Read in the
    function `gdi_multi_opaque_rect`. In particular there is no code to
    validate if the value `multi_opaque_rect->numRectangles` is less
    than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect->`numRectangles without
    proper boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which
    will likely lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in
    versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There
    are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-40567

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Write in the
    `clear_decompress_bands_data` function in which there is no offset
    validation. Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to an out of bounds
    write. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and
    3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. there are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-40181

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to an Integer-Underflow leading to Out-Of-Bound Read in the
    `zgfx_decompress_segment` function. In the context of `CopyMemory`,
    it's possible to read data beyond the transmitted packet range and
    likely cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions
    2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
    known workarounds for this issue.

CVE-2023-40186

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to an IntegerOverflow leading to Out-Of-Bound Write
    Vulnerability in the `gdi_CreateSurface` function. This issue
    affects FreeRDP based clients only. FreeRDP proxies are not affected
    as image decoding is not done by a proxy. This issue has been
    addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

CVE-2023-40188

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `general_LumaToYUV444`
    function. This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because processing is done
    on the `in` variable without checking if it contains data of
    sufficient length. Insufficient data for the `in` variable may cause
    errors or crashes. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0
    and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this issue.

CVE-2023-40569

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are
    subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Write in the `progressive_decompress`
    function. This issue is likely down to incorrect calculations of the
    `nXSrc` and `nYSrc` variables. This issue has been addressed in
    versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. there
    are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-40589

    FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol
    (RDP), released under the Apache license. In affected versions there
    is a Global-Buffer-Overflow in the ncrush_decompress function.
    Feeding crafted input into this function can trigger the overflow
    which has only been shown to cause a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.3.0+dfsg1-2+deb10u3.
