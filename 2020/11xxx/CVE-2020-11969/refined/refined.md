Incorrect configuration of the JMS Resource Adapter in Apache TomEE when using the embedded ActiveMQ broker. Specifically, a misconfiguration leads to the opening of a JMX port (TCP 1099) without authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated JMX port exposed on TCP port 1099

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to access the JMX management interface without any authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the affected TCP port 1099 of the Apache TomEE instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11969
- The vulnerability is present when Apache TomEE is configured to use the embedded ActiveMQ broker, and the configuration is incorrect.
- The fix involves upgrading to specific versions of Apache TomEE and ensuring correct usage of the VM broker name in the resource adapter configuration.
