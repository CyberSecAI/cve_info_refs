IoT has arrived in a big way because the potential benefits are immense. Whether it’s building and street light sensors, flow monitors, surveillance cameras, IP phones, point-of-sale systems, conference room technology or so much more, IoT is on the network and in the organization. IoT has become an essential piece of infrastructure for every enterprise and business. As I talk with IT organizations, they tell me they want an IoT security solution that lets them keep moving at full speed while alleviating their security concerns. We’ve developed an approach we believe can balance both of these needs.

Let's look at the problem and solution in a bit more depth.

## **The Unique Security Challenges of IoT Devices**

IoT devices present unique challenges for security teams. They are connected to an enterprise's central network, yet they are generally unmanaged. Different IoT devices use different hardware, operating systems and firmware. For the most part, they are also unregulated, shipped with unknown or unpatched vulnerabilities, and often their useful life exceeds their supported life. The recent [2020 Unit 42 IoT Threat Report](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/) said that “57% of IoT devices are vulnerable to medium- or high-severity attacks” and “98% of all IoT device traffic is unencrypted.”

One of the biggest fears is that these devices can be weaponized for launching cyber attacks. Most recently, [the Sofacy Group](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=sofacy) (Fancy Bear or APT28) was found compromising popular IoT devices such as VoIP phones, office printers and video decoders to infiltrate several corporate networks. This is simply one of many such IoT security incidents.

It's hard enough to assess the risks and enforce policies for IoT devices brought in for corporate projects, but many IoT devices are brought into organizations even without IT’s knowledge.

These devices are challenging enough to secure, but added to that, IT first needs to identify them, and that's a challenge all on its own.

Mainstream network perimeter defenses are poorly equipped to address these security challenges, and new IoT security vendors often fall short in addressing the issues completely. They are limited to device identification of only known asset types, have manual rule-based policy engines that don’t scale, and often use an unwieldy implementation of single-purpose sensors that then requires integrations with other vendors for any actual security. Existing approaches simply fail to meet the need.

## **The Role of Machine Learning in the IoT Security Lifecycle**

We think the most effective way to address IoT security challenges is by [securing the complete IoT security lifecycle](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/five-stages-iot-security-lifecycle.html), and the core of that approach is machine learning (ML). Last fall, we welcomed Zingbox to the Palo Alto Networks family because we believed their patented 3-tier machine learning platform was the best technology to help companies discover and identify unmanaged devices in the network.

We have enhanced Zingbox’s technology with Palo Alto Networks patented App-ID technology, allowing it to automatically discover new IoT devices, assess risks and convert the learnings into policies that secure IoT. Applying the rich prevention capabilities of Palo Alto Networks, IoT Security can be paired with the full range of our other cloud-delivered security subscriptions to stop all known and unknown threats targeting IoT and OT devices.

## **Simplifying IoT Security Implementation**

Distinct from other solutions, our solution does not require dedicated sensors, any other product for enforcement, manual fingerprinting technologies or painful counting of IoT devices for licensing – what you get is a complete solution.

For Palo Alto Networks customers, IoT Security is delivered as a new subscription, empowering existing security teams to start reclaiming unmanaged IoT devices in no time on any [Palo Alto Networks ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2020/06/network-PAN-OS-10-0) form factor – through PA-Series hardware appliances, VM-Series virtualized firewalls or over Prisma Access, our cloud-delivered secure access service edge (SASE) network security service.

For future customers not currently partnered with Palo Alto Networks, we deliver IoT Security on our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall that serves as a sensor and enforcement point. At a competitive value compared to siloed IoT security products, we can offer unmanaged device discovery, protection and enforcement in places you don't have your existing firewalls – eliminating your need to purchase and integrate multiple products and alter operational processes to gain a full security solution for IoT. If you need to add a sensor to secure IoT anyway, why go to that effort just for visibility?

## **Palo Alto Networks Is Here to Help**

No matter where you are in your IoT adoption journey – whether you’re an early industry adopter or are part of the early majority considering adoption and in proof of concept – security is germane to optimizing and defending your IoT investment from the risk of an overwhelming security breach. Our team at Palo Alto Networks is here to help you stay ahead of attacks.

 [Secure the Enterprise](/blog/category/secure-the-enterprise/)
[Firewall](/blog/tag/firewall/)[IOT security](/blog/tag/iot-security/)[Machine Learning](/blog/tag/machine-learning/)[network security](/blog/tag/network-security/)[NGFW](/blog/tag/ngfw/)[PAN-OS](/blog/tag/pan-os/)

Over the last 10 years, the network security industry has focused on reducing the time it takes to react to new attacks. The time required to create a signature and update all network security systems with it has been reduced from weeks to days to hours, and in our case, even to minutes. However, cybercriminals don't stay still. Attacks are continuously and automatically morphing and evading signature based detection techniques.

New IoT devices are being added to your network and their numbers are increasing rapidly without notice. Waiting for fingerprints to be created in order to identify and secure each new IoT device is yet another reactive technique that creates an unacceptable gap in your security.

To add to this complexity, enterprise networks are widening – with hybrid clouds, IoT devices and a remote workforce – and increasing the attack surface. It simply isn't possible for security administrators to keep security policy changes up to date fast enough using manual methods.

Reactive security can’t keep up. A paradigm shift in cybersecurity is needed. Network security needs to become proactive. The world needs a new type of Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) that:

* Helps stop new threats by embedding machine learning (ML) in the core of the firewall to provide real-time signatureless attack prevention.
* Identifies new IoT devices with ML and behavior-based identification, removing the dependence on fingerprints.
* Uses cloud-based CPU- and data-intensive ML processing to detect the most sophisticated attacks in near real time.
* Leverages cloud-based ML processes to push zero-delay signatures and instructions back to the NGFW to stop attacks and reconfigure policies.
* Continuously collects telemetry to enable cloud-based CPU and data intensive ML processes, which then recommends policy changes to optimize security utilization and outcomes.

## **Introducing the World’s First ML-Powered NGFW**

Today, Palo Alto Networks disrupts the industry once again by introducing the world’s first ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall. This is a paradigm shift in network security that enables you to stay ahead of unknown threats, see everything, including IoT, and reduce errors with automatic policy recommendations.

## **How Machine Learning Delivers Stronger Cybersecurity**

#### Prevent:

**ML-Based Inline Malware and Phishing Prevention**

Trying to reduce the time it takes to create and distribute new signatures to combat attacks that use machines and automatically morph is unproductive. In a completely new approach, our ML-Powered NGFW uses machine learning models to identify variants of known attacks as well as many unknown cyberthreats so you are able to prevent up to 95% of zero-day malware inline.

**Zero-Delay Signature Updates**

With this release, we’re introducing near-real-time protection with zero-delay signature updates.

#### Detect:

**ML-Based Integrated IoT Security**

To keep your network fully protected, every new [IoT device](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-iot-threat-report) added needs to be manually monitored, and your network security must be updated with that device’s fingerprint. During the time it takes to identify devices and make updates to the network, your organization is at risk. The [new IoT Security subscription](https://paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/iot-security) for the NGFW provides complete device visibility, behavioral anomaly detection and native enforcement to [secure IoT devices](/blog/2020/06/network-iot-security) without the need for additional sensors or infrastructure.

#### Improve:

**ML-Based Security Policy**

As it collects a wide variety of telemetry information from the network, the ML-Powered NGFW will recommend appropriate security policies. With PAN-OS 10.0 and IoT Security, customers will be able to view and adopt the IoT Security policy recommendations for safe device behavior. This will save time, reduce the chance of human error and help secure IoT devices.

## **Additional Innovations in PAN-OS 10.0**

In addition, PAN-OS 10.0 introduces the [CN-Series](https://paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/cn-series), the industry’s first ML-powered, [next-generation firewall built specifically for Kubernetes](/blog/2020/06/network-cn-series/) environments to provide security and compliance for your Kubernetes container environment.

Every single security service has been enhanced, including Snort support in Threat Prevention, new DNS Security categories with deep visibility, and more.

I continually hear from our customers that they love our forward-looking approach in anticipating their cybersecurity needs. The 70+ innovative new capabilities in this release, including easier decryption, high availability clustering and a new high-performance hardware card redefine the standard for network security so you don’t just keep up but stay ahead.

Welcome to the era of intelligent security – protecting your enterprise from the threats of tomorrow. Learn more about [PAN-OS 10.0](https://paloaltonetworks.com/products/new/pan-os).

## **Executive Summary**

On February 24, 2020, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers found vulnerabilities present in AvertX IP cameras running the latest firmware.

Three vulnerabilities were found in AvertX IP cameras with model number HD838 and 438IR, as confirmed by AvertX. These products are surveillance cameras intended to be used outdoors with infrared and object detection technology built-in. They also allow users to store the recordings in the cloud, in a network video recorder (NVR) and also create backups in an SD memory card.

The following are the three vulnerabilities we found:

* [CVE-2020-11625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11625): User enumeration
* [CVE-2020-11624](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11624): Weak password requirements
* [CVE-2020-11623](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11623): Exposed dangerous method or function

The detected vulnerabilities have the following impact:

* Attackers can remotely enumerate the usernames of IP camera accounts, facilitating brute-force attacks. Since it is possible to collect a set of valid usernames by interacting with the authentication mechanism of the application, it eases brute-force attacks, in which the attacker verifies if, given a valid username, it is possible to find the corresponding password.
* Attackers might be able to access the camera by using its default password because it does not force you to change the default password. A lot of IoT devices offer web-based configuration or administrative interfaces. Often these applications, once installed, are not properly configured and the default credentials provided for initial authentication and configuration are never changed. These default credentials can be obtained by reading the user manual of such a device. As a consequence, attackers, and most common IoT botnets, can use them to gain access to the IoT device.
* Attackers with physical access to the universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) interface can access its bootloader. As a consequence, they can access and modify additional configurations, reset the configuration and even render the camera inoperable.

The AvertX IP cameras that our team analyzed are rebranded Hikvision cameras with modifications. AvertX has released a [patch](https://www.avertx.com/downloads/) for these vulnerabilities and has also removed the UART connector and disabled the interface in the latest production batch.

According to the [2020 Unit 42 IoT Threat Report](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iot-threat-report-2020/), security cameras make up only 5% of enterprise IoT devices, but they account for 33% of all security issues. This is because many cameras are designed to be consumer-grade, focusing on simplicity of use and deployment over security.

Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from these vulnerabilities via the [ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/06/network-pan-os-10-0/), and [IoT Security](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/06/network-iot-security/), a subscription available for the NGFW.

## **CVE-2020-11625: User Enumeration**

Failed web user interface (UI) login attempts to the camera elicit different responses depending on whether a user account exists. Because the responses indicate whether a submitted username is valid or not, they make it easier to identify legitimate usernames.

If a login request is sent to ISAPI/Security/sessionLogin/capabilities using a username that exists on the camera, it will return the value of the salt given to that username, even if the password is incorrect:

![The screenshot shows what happens when a login request is sent to ISAPI/Security/sessionLogin/capabilities on AvertX IP cameras for a username that exists on the camera. ]()

However, if a login request is sent using a username that is not present in the IP camera’s database, it will return an empty salt value:

![This shows what happens when a login request is sent to AvertX IP cameras for a username that is not present in the IP camera's database. ]()

This allows attackers to enumerate legitimate usernames, facilitating brute-force attacks.

## **CVE-2020-11624: Weak Password Requirements**

The IP camera does not require users to change the default password for the admin account. Every time the user logs in with the default password, the camera shows a pop-up window suggesting the password be changed, but there’s no enforcement. An administrator can click “Cancel” and proceed to use the device without changing the password:

![AvertX IP cameras show a pop-up window suggesting the user change the default password for the admin account, but the suggestion can be ignored. ]()

The device allows incautious administrators to continue using the default password (admin/1234). Additionally, it discloses the default username on the login.js script:

![AvertX IP cameras disclose the default username on the login.js script.]()
## **CVE-2020-11623: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function**

There is an exposed UART interface that allows access to diagnostic and configuration functionalities, and even to system information that can be modified. This security vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with physical access to the UART interface.

![The bootloader console]()

The team was able to identify a 4-pin Molex connector that was unpopulated. Most UART interfaces in commercial products are between four and six pins, so the team proceeded to identify and test the pins.

![Image of the printed circuit board (PCB), with a 4-pin Molex connector present]()
![A closer view of the 4-pin Molex connector]()
#### Connecting to the UART

We connected to the UART interface through an Attify Badge, which is a hardware security tool that uses an FTDI chip, allowing it to speak a wide variety of communication protocols such as SPI, JTAG, I2C and UART. It also has a microUSB port, allowing it to be connected to a PC.

![Connecting to the UART]()

To determine the baud rate, we tested with the most common values. We opened a screen terminal to communicate with the camera’s UART using a baud rate of 115200. To obtain a Uboot prompt, we interrupted the booting process pressing CTRL + U. No username or password was required:

![Bootloader console access (U-boot)]()

At this point, several commands are available to obtain information about this device including the firmware and configuration settings. Since this device is intended to be used outdoors, it is especially important to protect it against physical attacks as well as remote attacks.

## Conclusion

In summary, the AvertX IP camera models HD838 and 438IR are a rebranded version of Hikvision cameras with modifications and have three vulnerabilities that can be used to compromise the device and even render it inoperable.

* The first is the user enumeration, which allows attackers to perform brute force attacks more efficiently.
* The second vulnerability is the lack of strong password requirements, which facilitates attackers’ efforts to find and compromise cameras using default credentials.
* The last one is an exposed UART interface, which allows attackers with physical access to the camera to extract information off the device, change configuration values and even render the device inoperable.

AvertX responded quickly when contacted and has released a [patch](https://www.avertx.com/downloads/) for the issues mentioned above. In addition, AvertX has removed the UART connector and disabled the interface starting with the latest production batch.

Palo Alto Networks protects its customers from attacks on AvertX IP cameras through the following platforms:

1. The [ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/06/network-pan-os-10-0/), which is capable of identifying brute force attacks to block or alert them.
2. [IoT Security](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/06/network-iot-security/), a subscription available for the NGFW, which detects brute force attacks on IoT devices and anomalous traffic.
