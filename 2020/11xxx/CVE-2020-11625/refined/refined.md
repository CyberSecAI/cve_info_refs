Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11625:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The AvertX IP camera's web interface responds differently to login attempts depending on whether the username exists or not. Specifically, it returns a salt value for valid usernames even if the password is incorrect. Conversely, it returns an empty salt value for invalid usernames.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
User enumeration vulnerability due to inconsistent responses for valid vs. invalid usernames during login attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can remotely enumerate valid usernames, which facilitates brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access to the camera.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote access through the camera's web interface (specifically, the ISAPI/Security/sessionLogin/capabilities endpoint).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera's web interface. No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.
