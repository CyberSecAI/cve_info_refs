  "CVE-2020-11087": {
    "Description": "In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound read in ntlm_read_AuthenticateMessage. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.",
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds read in the `ntlm_read_AuthenticateMessage` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a crash or potentially leak information from memory by sending a specially crafted NTLM Authenticate Message.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send a malicious NTLM Authenticate message to the FreeRDP client or server.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability affects both FreeRDP clients and servers that use NTLM authentication. The impact is low due to a following check that triggers an error."
