Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-11680:

**Root Cause:** The application lacks proper authorization checks, allowing low-privileged users to access and execute functionality intended for administrator-level users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control mechanisms. While the application might restrict access to certain pages via GET requests for low-privileged users, it fails to properly authorize POST requests.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application does not verify if the user has the necessary privileges before processing the POST requests to administrative functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Low-privileged users can directly invoke administrator functionalities. This allows them to modify user accounts (including their own privileges), modify the application's configuration, and potentially compromise other user accounts.
*   **Data Modification/Manipulation:** Attackers can alter critical application data, such as user roles and configuration settings
*  **Account Compromise:** By modifying user roles and forcing password resets, attackers can completely take over user accounts.
*   **Abuse of Functionality:** Attackers can use the exposed administrative functions (e.g., Alerts, Archiving, FileStores, LDAP, Roles, SMTP, User management) to disrupt or control the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP POST Requests:** Attackers can bypass the user interface and directly send POST requests to the application's administrative endpoints.
*  **CSRF (Combined):**  While not the primary vulnerability, the content mentions that this vulnerability combined with CSRF (CVE-2020-11682), can lead to any application user being used to grant admin access to a malicious user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the application, even a low-privileged one.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application's server.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was found in *Castel NextGen DVR v1.0.0* and has been fixed in version 1.0.1.
*   The provided content also highlights the risk of relying on front-end restrictions, such as hiding elements with CSS or HTML comments, as a means of security.
