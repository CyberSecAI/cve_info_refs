Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-11736:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper checks in `fr-archive-libarchive.c` when extracting files from an archive. Specifically, the code doesn't verify if a file's parent directory is a symbolic link pointing outside the intended extraction path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The vulnerability allows an attacker to create a malicious archive where symlinks within the archive point to locations outside the intended extraction directory, potentially leading to writing files outside the intended location.
- Improper symlink handling: The software does not properly validate or restrict the use of symlinks during archive extraction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: By writing files to arbitrary locations using crafted symlinks, an attacker can overwrite or create files containing sensitive information, potentially leading to data exposure.
- Arbitrary file write: An attacker can write files to locations they do not have write access to through the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious archive file: An attacker crafts a malicious archive file containing symlinks that, upon extraction, cause the application to write data to arbitrary locations.
- Local attack: A local user who can trick another user into opening a maliciously crafted archive could exploit this.
- Potentially remote: This could be exploited remotely if the vulnerable software is used to extract archives received from an external source.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify archive files.
- Ability to convince a user to extract the malicious archive using the vulnerable version of file-roller.
