The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Plesk Onyx 17.8.11 (Linux) and Plesk Obsidian 18.0.17 (Windows).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the `redirectStatus[message]` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization/encoding for the `redirectStatus[message]` parameter in the URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL.
- The vulnerable parameter is `redirectStatus[message]` within the query string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the payload in the `redirectStatus[message]` parameter.
- The attacker needs to lure a victim into clicking the malicious link or otherwise accessing the vulnerable URL while logged into Plesk.
- The attacker can be external.
