Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-11857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of the `shrboadmin` user during the installation of Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter (OBR). This user account is created with a hard-coded password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of a hard-coded password for the `shrboadmin` user. This is a well-known and easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Because of the hardcoded password, an attacker can bypass normal authentication methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker can gain access to the OBR host by using the hard-coded password for the `shrboadmin` user.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation**: Access to the system as a non-admin user could allow an attacker to perform further malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or denial-of-service, within the scope of the user's permissions.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** While the vulnerability allows access as a non-admin user, the Zeroday Initiative advisory indicates that the vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the `shrboadmin` user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker does not need to be on the local network or have local access to the server.
*   **Network:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network if the OBR server is accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OBR server.
*   **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker must know the hardcoded password of the `shrboadmin` user.

**Additional Notes**

*   The affected versions include Operations Bridge Reporter 10.40 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Pedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security.
