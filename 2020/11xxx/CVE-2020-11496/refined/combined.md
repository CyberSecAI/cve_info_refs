# IT security at Sprecher Automation

With ever increasing digitisation, the world is undergoing constant change, and power grids are no exception. This evolution and the growing number of participants in the power grid (particularly with smart grids) increase the possible targets for attacks within the system. Not surprisingly, data management and security are playing an ever more important role. We think about IT security with all products – our devices have been, and will always be, developed for use in critical infrastructure (energy, water, ICT & telecommunications as well as transport & travel).

### IT security as an overarching approach

Security is not only the focus for individual devices, but also for Sprecher Automation itself. At Sprecher Automation, IT security is an integrated corporate process. Qualified security officers have also been appointed.

Security guidelines as well as coding rules for development and system design have been developed based on clear-cut security requirements. They specify the use of analytical tools to detect vulnerabilities, which are monitored and controlled by a database. The complete source code is retained by Sprecher Automation. System hardening (i.e., configuring the system securely) is achieved through using professional and established work routines. Production and the final inspection of the systems takes place in Austria, at Sprecher's headquarters in Linz. This is how we guarantee long-term patch supply. Production and final inspection of the devices and systems by our professional team takes place solely in Austria.

Thanks to its Information Security Management System (ISMS) and its business processes, Sprecher Automation is certified to ISO 27001 and also advises its customers during their own ISMS implementation.
