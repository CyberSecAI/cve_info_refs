Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The SNMPc OnLine web application lacks CSRF protections. Specifically, it does not implement CSRF tokens or other header-based protections. This allows an attacker to force a logged-in user to perform actions on the site without their consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Absence of CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., CSRF tokens)
- Use of GET requests for state-changing operations (although the PoC uses a form submit to emulate a POST request).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions, such as modifying backup settings or initiating backups.
- In the described scenario, the attacker could change the backup directory to a location they control (SMB share), allowing them to gain access to sensitive data stored in the backup files.
- Through chained exploitation with other vulnerabilities, this can ultimately lead to full administrative control of the NMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious web page (CSRF.html) containing a form that targets a vulnerable endpoint in the SNMPc OnLine web application.
- The attacker hosts this page on their server and tricks a logged-in user into accessing the malicious page.
- Upon accessing the page, the user's browser automatically submits the form, triggering the desired action on the vulnerable application with the user's authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a web page that the victim can access.
- The victim must be a logged-in user of the vulnerable SNMPc OnLine web application.
- The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint and parameters to target in the CSRF attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to exploit the CSRF vulnerability and chain it with other vulnerabilities (XSS and unencrypted credentials in backups).
- The document specifically highlights the use of GET requests for state-changing operations as a contributing factor.
- The attacker can use XSS to automatically redirect a victim user to the malicious CSRF page.
