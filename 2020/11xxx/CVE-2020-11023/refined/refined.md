  "CVE-2020-11023": {
    "description": "In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.0.3 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML containing <option> elements from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code. This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way jQuery's DOM manipulation methods handle HTML containing `<option>` elements when the source of the HTML is untrusted. Specifically,  `.html()`, `.append()`, and other similar methods are affected.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of untrusted HTML",
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Executing untrusted code through the manipulation of DOM elements, which could lead to XSS attacks and potentially allow attackers to gain unauthorized access or control.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to inject malicious HTML into the input processed by vulnerable jQuery methods. This requires the attacker to control the input or have a man in the middle position. User interaction is also required as the injected HTML is processed via a user interaction trigger"
