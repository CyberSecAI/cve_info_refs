#### iManager Displays Wrong Title in the Login Dialog Box When Locale Is Set to French

*Issue:*
When the iManager locale is set to French, after logging out of the iManager server, the login dialog box displays wrong title for the Username field. (Bug 1131552)

#### The SecretStore Plug-In Is Missing from iManager 3.x

*Issue:*
iManager 3.x does not contain the SecretStore plug-in. This happens due to the iManager 3.x server(s) using Java 8 and above which is not supported by the older version of SecretStore plug-ins.

*Fix:*
iManager 3.2 SP3 does bundle the latest version of the SecretStore plug-in.(Bug 1160359)

#### iManager Fails to Backup Specific Configuration Files While Upgrading

*Issue:*
iManager fails to backup certain configuration files while upgrading the server as part of OES. (Bug 1172635)
