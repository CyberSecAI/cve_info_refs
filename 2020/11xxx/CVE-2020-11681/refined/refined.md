Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application returns sensitive credentials (specifically for the SMTP server) in cleartext within the HTML source code of the `/Administration/SMTP` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive information (SMTP credentials) is exposed in the client-side source code.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** While access to the `/Administration/SMTP` page is restricted to higher-privileged roles, this restriction is circumvented by exploiting other vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-11679 and CVE-2020-11680) to gain elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** An attacker can obtain the cleartext SMTP credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With the stolen SMTP credentials, an attacker can abuse the SMTP account to send spoofed messages, distribute spam, or potentially gain further access to other systems that rely on these credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploit CVE-2020-11679 or CVE-2020-11680 to gain administrator access and then navigate to the vulnerable `/Administration/SMTP` page.
- **Account Compromise:** If an attacker compromises a legitimate user account they can then escalate privileges and access the vulnerable page.
- **CSRF Exploitation:** Exploit CVE-2020-11682 (CSRF vulnerability) to trick a user into performing actions that grant elevated privileges to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the application, either by having a low-privileged account or by compromising a valid account.
- **Ability to View Source Code:** After gaining access, the attacker needs the ability to view the source code of the `/Administration/SMTP` page.
- **Exploitation of Other Vulnerabilities:** In order to reach the page, the attacker must exploit privilege escalation or CSRF vulnerabilities.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was found during a penetration test.
- The issue was resolved in version 1.0.1 of the software (Castel NextGen DVR v1.0.0 was vulnerable)
