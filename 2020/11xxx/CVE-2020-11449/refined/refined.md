{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The router's backup file (backupsettings.conf) contains administrator credentials and Wi-Fi credentials in plaintext or easily recoverable format.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure storage of sensitive information (administrator credentials, Wi-Fi credentials) in the backup file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who obtains the backup file can extract administrator credentials and Wi-Fi credentials, gaining full control over the router and the Wi-Fi network.",
  "Attack vectors": "Obtaining the router's backup file (backupsettings.conf). The method of obtaining the file is not specified, but it is likely through a vulnerability in the device's web interface or network access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to acquire a backup file (backupsettings.conf) from the target router."
