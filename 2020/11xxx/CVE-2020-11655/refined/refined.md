Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a mishandling of the initialization of the `AggInfo` object in SQLite when processing a malformed window-function query. Specifically, a semantic error during the processing of the aggregate query prevents the `resetAccumulator()` function from exiting early. This incomplete or incorrect initialization of the `AggInfo` object leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Initialization:** The `AggInfo` object is not properly initialized when a semantic error is encountered in an aggregate query.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The improper handling of the `AggInfo` object's initialization leads to a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service condition due to a segmentation fault, causing the affected application or process to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Window-Function Query:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted, malformed window-function query to SQLite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Queries:** Attackers must be able to send queries to the vulnerable SQLite instance. This could be through an application that uses SQLite directly, or via an intermediary layer that accepts SQL statements.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Public information states that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information states that the vulnerability has been present since window function support was added in SQLite version 3.25.0 (2018-06-30), but that a regression resulted in a segmentation fault as of a later commit date of 2019-08-10, whereas before it only caused an assertion failure.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check in the `resetAccumulator()` function to ensure that the function exits early if there is a semantic error or the aggregation info is invalid. This prevents the crash from occurring.
*   The vulnerability affects SQLite versions up to 3.31.1.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network without authentication.
* Several sources mention this vulnerability is also addressed in the fix for CVE-2019-16168.
