Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-11582:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a combination of vulnerabilities that, when chained, lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). Specifically, the vulnerability relies on the lack of proper validation of the server certificate and hostname by the Pulse Secure host checker, coupled with a command injection vulnerability in the remediation instructions. Additionally, a DNS rebinding attack can be used to set a malicious cookie, which is then leveraged for the command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Server Certificate Validation:** The client disables certificate validation (`trustAllCerts`) and hostname verification (`allowHostnameMismatch`), which allows a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker to impersonate the legitimate server.
2.  **Command Injection:** The host checker uses the `NARUtil.execCommand()` function which is a wrapper around `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` to execute remediation instructions. The remediation instruction URL, which contains the DSPREAUTH cookie, is directly appended to the command for launching the browser, without any sanitization. This allows for command injection if the cookie contains malicious code.
3.  **DNS Rebinding:** The host checker opens a command socket on all interfaces without authentication (only accepting connections from localhost for direct commands). This allows an attacker to perform a DNS rebinding attack to send commands to this socket, including the `setcookie` command to set malicious cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the victim's machine. This can lead to:
*   Complete control over the compromised system.
*   Data exfiltration.
*   Installation of malware.
*   Further lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the Pulse Connect Secure server. This allows the attacker to inject malicious cookies and serve a policy that always triggers non-compliance.
2.  **DNS Rebinding:** An attacker sets up a malicious DNS server that can point a domain name to a specific IP address, which can be first the attackerâ€™s server and then the localhost to communicate to the command socket. This can allow the attacker to set a malicious cookie using the command socket running on the victim's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MITM Attack:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the Pulse Secure client and the server (same network or routing control).
*   **DNS Rebinding:** The attacker needs to control or have access to a DNS server, or use a service that allows for DNS rebinding attacks. 
*   **Target User Interaction:** The victim user would need to be using the vulnerable Pulse Secure host checker on a Linux, Solaris, or macOS machine (although the command injection example focuses on Linux).

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description, as it elaborates on the vulnerable code sections and the full attack chain.
* The vulnerability was found in the Java-based host checker used by Pulse Secure for Linux, Solaris and macOS.
* The attack can be achieved with a crafted cookie containing shell commands which are executed on the victim's machine during the remediation process.
* The provided content references other CVEs (CVE-2020-11580 and CVE-2020-11581), however, the current analysis is focused on CVE-2020-11582.

This information provides a thorough understanding of the vulnerability described in the context of the CVE-2020-11582.
