Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11021:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `http-client` did not strip the authorization header when a request was redirected to a different domain or hostname.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The http client was passing the authorization header to a different domain when a redirect occurred. This could potentially expose sensitive authorization information to untrusted third parties.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive authorization headers to unintended third-party domains/hosts.
- Potential for unauthorized access or actions on the redirected domain if the authorization header is valid within that domain's context.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could initiate a request to a controlled domain/host, which then responds with a redirect to a different target domain while also retaining the authorization header in the redirect request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the initial redirect request and the redirect response which can direct the request to an arbitrary domain/host with the authorization header.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.8 of the `@actions/http-client` package by stripping the authorization header when a redirect to a different hostname was detected.
- The vulnerability is specific to the http client implementation in the `@actions/http-client` package, which is used in GitHub Actions.
- A security advisory was published to address this vulnerability (GHSA-9w6v-m7wp-jwg4), which includes the CVE identifier.
