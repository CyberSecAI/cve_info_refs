Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-11701, focusing on the identified Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the ProVide web user interface:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the absence of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in the ProVide web user interface. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can perform unwanted actions on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF, allowing unauthorized actions to be performed on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially use CSRF to:
    *   Modify user settings
    *   Change server configurations
    *   Upload or delete files
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to data.
    *   Take any action that the user could take, depending on the server functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** The attacker would craft a malicious web page that includes a request to the vulnerable ProVide server. This page could be hosted on any website controlled by the attacker.
*   **Links and Phishing:** The attacker could distribute links to the malicious page via email, social media, or other methods.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would use social engineering to trick a user into clicking the link and visiting the malicious page while that user is also logged into ProVide.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target:**  The attacker needs to know the target's ProVide server URL.
*   **User Authentication:** The attacker needs to trick the user into triggering the forged request when the user has an active session with the ProVide server.
*   **Crafted Request:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious HTTP request to perform the desired action on the ProVide server.
*   **Hosting or Delivery:** The attacker needs a way to host or deliver the malicious content to the targeted user.

**Additional Information:**

The github.com content specifically highlights "Cross-Site Request Forgery" for the ProVide Web User Interface. It also provides a link to a dedicated page for this vulnerability: `https://belong2yourself.github.io/vulnerabilities/`, but this link redirects to another url, `https://belong2yourself.github.io/vulnerabilities/`.  This confirms that a CSRF vulnerability exists.

The provideserver.com content, which is the official website of ProVide, discusses various security features, including SSL/TLS, SFTP, and encryption algorithms and achieving a perfect score on the Qualys SSL Labs test. However, it doesn't mention anything about CSRF or mitigation techniques specifically and the content also doesn't reference CVE-2020-11701 by id.

The information from both sources suggests a gap in the security of the ProVide software that requires additional measures to prevent CSRF attacks.
