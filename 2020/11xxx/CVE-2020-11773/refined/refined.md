The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but it does not specify any CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the web interface of several Netgear router models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the device's web interface. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Account takeover
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the device's web interface. An attacker would need to find an input field or other mechanism to inject malicious script.
- The injected script is then stored on the router and executed when a user accesses the vulnerable part of the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would likely need to be authenticated to the web interface to exploit this vulnerability. This is indicated by the CVSS vector "PR:H" (Privileges Required: High).

**Affected Devices:**
- D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
- R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
- R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.68
- R8900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
- R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
- RAX120, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78
- XR500, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.56
- XR700, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.10

**CVSS v3 Rating:** Medium
**CVSS v3 Score:** 6
**Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
