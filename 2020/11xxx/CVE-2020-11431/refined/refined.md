The provided content relates to CVE-2020-11431.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an "Improper Path Traversal" (CWE-22).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to download any file on the server system that the affected i-net software process has access to. This is due to the improper handling of file paths, enabling traversal outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from the server. This could expose sensitive information, configuration files, or other data that the server process has access to.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a network-accessible instance of the affected i-net software server, allowing an attacker to send specially crafted requests to exploit the path traversal flaw.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable i-net PDFC, i-net HelpDesk or i-net Clear Reports server. They do not need to log into the application. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server itself.
