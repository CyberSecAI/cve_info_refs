The provided content is related to CVE-2020-11498. It references a pull request ([#191](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/pull/191)) in the `slackhq/nebula` repository with the commit message "use absolute paths on darwin and windows". This pull request is associated with the vulnerability mentioned in the golang/vulndb issue ([#2269](https://github.com/golang/vulndb/issues/2269)) that refers to CVE-2020-11498.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of relative paths when executing system binaries, particularly on Darwin (macOS) and Windows. The pull request description indicates the intent was to "use the system binaries, and not whatever is in the PATH." This implies that before the fix, the application might have used binaries from a user-controlled `PATH` variable, leading to a potential vulnerability.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The weakness lies in the reliance on the `PATH` environment variable to locate executables instead of using absolute paths to system binaries. This can lead to an attacker placing a malicious executable with the same name as a system binary earlier in the `PATH` variable, which will be executed instead of the intended system binary.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by replacing system binaries with malicious ones. The impact would depend on the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `PATH` environment variable of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the `PATH` environment variable, either directly or indirectly through other vulnerabilities, for example by modifying the environment of the user running the application.

The provided content gives the context behind the fix and confirms that a vulnerability existed due to the use of relative paths. The pull request intends to fix this vulnerability by using absolute paths for system binaries on Darwin and Windows.
