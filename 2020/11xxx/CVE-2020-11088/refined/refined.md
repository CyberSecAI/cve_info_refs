{
  "CVE-2020-11088": {
    "Description": "In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound read in ntlm_read_NegotiateMessage. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `ntlm_read_NegotiateMessage` function within the NTLM authentication process.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "The out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to a crash or denial of service. There is a check that will abort processing upon an OOB read reducing the likelihood of data exfiltration.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious client can cause the server to read out-of-bounds memory by sending a crafted NTLM Negotiate message during the authentication process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the FreeRDP server and initiate the NTLM authentication process with a specially crafted message."
