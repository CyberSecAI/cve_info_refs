- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A regression in Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.12 prevents JMX re-bind by passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map containing authentication credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The empty environment map allows remote JMX clients to bypass authentication checks. This permits the creation of a `javax.management.loading.MLet` MBean and subsequently create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious remote client could execute arbitrary code on the server running Apache ActiveMQ.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote JMX clients connecting to the vulnerable ActiveMQ server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the JMX port of the vulnerable ActiveMQ instance and the ability to interact with the JMX interface.
