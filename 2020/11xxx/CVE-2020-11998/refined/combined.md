CVE-2020-11998: Apache ActiveMQ JMX remote client could execute arbitrary code
Severity: Moderate
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Affected Version: only Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.12
Vulnerability details:
A regression has been introduced in the commit preventing JMX re-bind.
By passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map that contains
he authentication credentials, it leaves ActiveMQ open to the following attack:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html
"A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use
it to create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no
security manager. In other words, a rogue remote client could make your
Java application execute arbitrary code."
Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.13
