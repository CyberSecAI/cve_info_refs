Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `rankmath/v1/updateMeta` REST API endpoint of the Rank Math SEO plugin. This endpoint lacked a `permission_callback`, meaning it didn't perform any capability checks before allowing access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of any access control on the `rankmath/v1/updateMeta` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to send requests to the endpoint and execute its functions.
*   **Arbitrary Metadata Update:** The `update_metadata` function, called by the vulnerable endpoint, allows modification of metadata for various WordPress objects, including users, posts, comments, and terms. Critically, this includes the ability to modify user metadata, which controls user roles and capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could grant administrative privileges to any registered user on the site by manipulating the `wp_user_level` and `wp_capabilities` metadata.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could remove administrative privileges from existing administrators, effectively locking them out of their own sites.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The ability to update metadata for posts, terms, and comments could be leveraged for XSS attacks, especially if other plugins on the site do not properly sanitize metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated REST API Request:** The attack is performed by sending a `$_POST` request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint `wp-json/rankmath/v1/updateMeta`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication to the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the existence and functionality of the `rankmath/v1/updateMeta` REST endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
register_rest_route(
    $this->namespace,
    '/updateMeta',
    [
        'methods'  => WP_REST_Server::CREATABLE,
        'callback' => [ $this, 'update_metadata' ],
        'args'     => $this->get_update_metadata_args(),
    ]
);
```

The `update_metadata` function could be called without any authentication:

```php
public function update_metadata( WP_REST_Request $request ) {
    $object_id   = $request->get_param( 'objectID' );
    $object_type = $request->get_param( 'objectType' );
    $meta        = $request->get_param( 'meta' );

    $new_slug = true;
    if ( isset( $meta['permalink'] ) && ! empty( $meta['permalink'] ) ) {
        $post     = get_post( $object_id );
        $new_slug = wp_unique_post_slug( $meta['permalink'], $post->ID, $post->post_status, $post->post_type, $post->post_parent );
        wp_update_post(
            [
                'ID'        => $object_id,
                'post_name' => $new_slug,
            ]
        );
        unset( $meta['permalink'] );
    }

    $sanitizer = Sanitize::get();
    foreach ( $meta as $meta_key => $meta_value ) {
        if ( empty( $meta_value ) ) {
            delete_metadata( $object_type, $object_id, $meta_key );
            continue;
        }

        update_metadata( $object_type, $object_id, $meta_key, $sanitizer->sanitize( $meta_key, $meta_value ) );
    }

    return $new_slug;
}
```
An example of an attack request, as described in the content, would be:
```
$_POST to `wp-json/rankmath/v1/updateMeta`
   with `objectID` set to the User ID to be modified
   `objectType` set to `user`
   `meta[wp_user_level]` set to `10`
   `meta[wp_capabilities][administrator]` set to `1`
```

This would promote the user with the specified `objectID` to administrator.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.41.1 of the Rank Math SEO plugin.
*   Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule to block exploitation attempts before the patch was released.
