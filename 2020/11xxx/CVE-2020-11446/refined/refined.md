- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities in Windows' handling of hard links and how ESET products perform write operations in certain directories. Specifically, a user with limited privileges could create hard links in specific ESET directories and then force the ESET product to write through these links into files that the user would not normally have write access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper handling of hard links by Windows OS.
    - Insufficient permission checks by ESET products during write operations to specific directories.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a user with limited rights to overwrite files they wouldn't normally have access to, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker can create hard links in specific ESET directories, forcing the ESET product to write to target files through these links.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with limited access rights on a machine with an affected ESET product installed and on an affected version of Windows.

This advisory provides more detail than the typical CVE description. It specifies the affected products, the specific vulnerable module versions, the required Windows security updates, and the method of exploitation (hard links).
