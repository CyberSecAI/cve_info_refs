  "CVE-2020-11884": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel on s390 architecture. The issue occurs on multiprocessing systems when one s390 CPU is in Secondary Address Mode and another CPU does a kernel page table upgrade. An inter-processor interrupt (IPI) is then sent to each active CPU to update the control registers with new page table addresses. In Secondary Address Mode the CPU's CR1 register may hold kernel space address to fetch instructions from, but after IPI processing, the same CR1 register is set to point to a user space address. An unprivileged user or process on the system may use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
    "root_cause": "Race condition in memory management code for IBM Z (s390x architecture) during page table upgrades in kernel sections using secondary address mode.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of page table upgrades",
      "Race condition between page table upgrade and uaccess on s390"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service (system crash), execute arbitrary code, or escalate their privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Trigger a page table upgrade while another CPU is in secondary address mode."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unprivileged user or process on the system."
