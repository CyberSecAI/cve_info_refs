Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-11474:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The NCP Secure Enterprise Windows Client allows low-privileged users to perform a "Support Assistant" operation that creates files in a user-controlled directory. Some of these files are created with administrative privileges.
- A low-privileged user can create a symbolic link within this user-controlled directory to redirect file writes to an arbitrary location.
- When the "Support Assistant" operation is executed again, the target file (pointed to by the symlink) is written with administrative privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Privileged File Write:** The core issue is that a privileged process writes files to a user-controlled location, which can be redirected via a symbolic link.
- **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a result of the application not properly handling symbolic links in user-controlled paths, allowing redirection of privileged file writes to unintended locations.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize the target path before performing privileged file writes, making it susceptible to symlink attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain elevated privileges by redirecting the privileged write to a location where they can overwrite system files or other critical resources. Parts of the file content are user-controlled, enabling further exploitation.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can redirect file writes to disrupt critical system operations or overwrite system resources, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs local access to the machine where the vulnerable NCP Secure Enterprise Windows Client is installed.
- **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** An attacker must be able to create symbolic links or pseudo symbolic links (as described in the provided PoC) within a user-controlled directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a low-privileged user on a system with the vulnerable NCP Secure Enterprise Windows Client version 10.14 installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the "Support Assistant" operation.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create symbolic links, or pseudo symbolic links, in the user-controlled directory where the client writes files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found by Tobias Neitzel of usd AG during a pentest.
- A fix was released in NCP Secure Enterprise Client version 10.15 r47589.
- The advisory recommends that privileged file operations on user-controlled parts of the file system should be treated with special care and that privileged file writes should only target protected locations. The advisory also suggests that privileged processes can implement mitigations such as impersonation or inspecting targeted files for filesystem links.
