Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap overflow located in the Bareos Director component. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the `fd_cmds.cc` file, line 1119 during the processing of data received from a file daemon during a "Verify" job.
*   The root cause is that the code uses `scanf()` to read a digest string from a message received from a file daemon without verifying the size of the digest against the size of the buffer it will be written into.
*   A malicious file daemon can exploit this by sending a digest string that is longer than the allocated buffer size, causing a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. The code attempts to write data into a fixed-size buffer without checking if the incoming data exceeds that buffer's capacity.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation of the size of the digest string received from the file daemon.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The description suggests that this heap overflow is likely usable to gain remote control over the director from a client. This implies the possibility of arbitrary code execution on the director's host.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As a more immediate effect, the heap overflow can cause the director process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered over the network during communication between the Bareos Director and a file daemon.
*   **Malicious File Daemon:** An attacker needs control over a file daemon that connects to a vulnerable Bareos Director. The attacker-controlled file daemon sends a maliciously crafted message with an oversized digest string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Bareos Director.
*   **Control of a File Daemon:** The attacker needs to control or be able to impersonate a file daemon that communicates with the targeted Bareos Director.
*   **Initiate Verify Job:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger a "Verify" job, since the vulnerability is triggered as part of that job's communication.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Bareos: <= 16.2.10, <= 17.2.9, <= 18.2.8, and <= 19.2.7.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Bareos versions 19.2.8, 18.2.9, and 17.2.10.
*   The fix involves resizing the buffer to be at least the size of the received message buffer before parsing with `scanf()`.
*   The issue was also reported to Bacula, and they addressed it in their corresponding software.
*   A workaround mentioned is disabling verify jobs.
*   The vulnerability is also present in Debian's bacula package which was fixed in version 7.4.4+dfsg-6+deb9u2.
