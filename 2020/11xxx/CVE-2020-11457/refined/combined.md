##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

=============================================================================
pfSense-SA-20\_06.webgui Security Advisory
pfSense
Topic: XSS vulnerability in the WebGUI
Category: pfSense Base System
Module: webgui
Announced: 2020-03-10
Credits: Matthew Aberegg
Affects: pfSense software versions <= 2.4.4-p3
Corrected: 2020-03-09 12:55:51 UTC (pfSense/master, pfSense 2.5.0)
2020-03-09 12:55:57 UTC (pfSense/RELENG\_2\_4\_5, pfSense 2.4.5)
0. Revision History
v1.0 2020-03-10 Initial SA draft
I. Background
pfSense® software is a free network firewall distribution based on the
FreeBSD operating system. The pfSense software distribution includes third-
party free software packages for additional functionality, and provides most of
the functionality of common commercial firewalls.
The majority of users of pfSense software have never installed or used a stock
FreeBSD system. Unlike similar GNU/Linux-based firewall distributions, there
is no need for any UNIX knowledge. The command line is never used, and there
is no need to ever manually edit any rule sets. Instead, pfSense software
includes a web interface for the configuration of all included components.
Users familiar with commercial firewalls will quickly understand the web
interface, while those unfamiliar with commercial-grade firewalls may encounter
a short learning curve.
II. Problem Description
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in
system\_usermanager\_addprivs.php, a component of the pfSense software WebGUI, on
version 2.4.4-p3 and earlier.
The page did not encode the descr parameter (full name) of a user in its output,
leading to a possible XSS.
III. Impact
Due to the lack of proper encoding on the affected parameters susceptible to
XSS, arbitrary JavaScript could be executed in the user's browser. The user's
session cookie or other information from the session may be compromised.
IV. Workaround
To help mitigate the problem on older releases, use one or more
of the following:
\* Limit access to the affected pages to trusted administrators only.
\* Do not log into the firewall with the same browser used for non-
administrative web browsing.
V. Solution
Users can upgrade to version 2.4.5 or later. This upgrade may be performed in
the web interface or from the console.
See https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/upgrade-guide.html
Users may also apply the relevant revisions below using the System Patches
package on pfSense 2.4.4-p3.
See https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/development/system-patches.html
