Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output encoding of the `descr` parameter (user's full name) within the `system_usermanager_addprivs.php` file in the pfSense web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw. Because the user-provided `descr` field is not sanitized before being outputted in the user management interface, malicious JavaScript can be stored in the user's description and executed when the page is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of a user accessing the vulnerable page.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  The injected script could steal the user's session cookie, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to the pfSense web interface.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive information available within the user's session.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform unauthorized actions through the user's authenticated session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the pfSense web interface.
*   **User Manager Functionality:** The specific area is the "User Manager" functionality, where user descriptions are displayed.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to add or modify a user, injecting the XSS payload in the `descr` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication to pfSense Web Interface:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the pfSense web interface to access the user management functionality and create or modify a user entry.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be able to craft HTTP POST requests, including the necessary parameters to add or modify a user in the User Manager.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Versions:** The vulnerability affects pfSense software versions 2.4.4-p3 and earlier.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.4.5 and later. Patches for 2.4.4-p3 can be applied using the System Patches package.
*   **Affected File:** The vulnerable code is in `src/usr/local/www/system_usermanager_addprivs.php`.
*   **Mitigation:** Limiting access to the user management pages to trusted administrators and not logging into the firewall with the same browser used for normal web browsing can help mitigate the risk.
