*   **Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2279-1:** Lists CVE-2020-11996 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the update for `tomcat8`.
*   **openSUSE Security Update:** Mentions CVE-2020-11996 being fixed in the `tomcat` update.
*   **SUSE Bugzilla:** The bug report `1173389` is explicitly linked to CVE-2020-11996.
*   **NetApp Security Advisory NTAP-20200709-0002:**  The advisory is specifically about CVE-2020-11996.
*   **Debian Security Advisory DSA-4727-1:**  Includes CVE-2020-11996 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed.
*   **NetApp Security Advisories:** Many advisories include CVE-2020-11996 in their lists.
*   **Ubuntu Security Notice USN-4596-1:** Describes the CVE as a vulnerability in Tomcat that can cause a denial of service due to improper management of HTTP/2 streams.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of HTTP/2 requests within the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine. A "specially crafted sequence" of HTTP/2 requests can lead to excessive CPU consumption.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper resource management:** Tomcat fails to manage HTTP/2 requests effectively.
*   **Lack of input validation/rate limiting:**  Tomcat does not appear to have mechanisms to prevent or mitigate the impact of malicious request sequences.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition due to excessive CPU usage. A sufficient number of such crafted requests on concurrent HTTP/2 connections can render the server unresponsive.
*   **Resource exhaustion:** The vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion, as the server gets bogged down with processing the malicious requests.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is remote, via network requests sent to a vulnerable Apache Tomcat server.
*   **HTTP/2:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted sequences of HTTP/2 requests.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the target server.
*   **No authentication is required:** The attacker does not need any specific credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Crafted HTTP/2 Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send the specific malicious HTTP/2 request sequences to trigger the high CPU consumption.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Apache Tomcat: 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M5, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.35, and 8.5.0 to 8.5.55.
*   Patches are available in later versions of Tomcat (10.0.0-M6, 9.0.36, and 8.5.56, respectively).
*   NetApp identified that their OnCommand System Manager 3.x product was vulnerable, however, it will not be fixed.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by multiple sources.
*   A public discussion about the vulnerability was noted.
*   The vulnerability can cause the server to become unresponsive.
