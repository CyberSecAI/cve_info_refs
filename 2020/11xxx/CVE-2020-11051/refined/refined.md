Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11051:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization in the Markdown editor's preview panel. When a user with write access loads a page with malicious Markdown content in the editor, the XSS payload within the markdown gets executed in the preview pane.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. Malicious code embedded in markdown is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the preview panel of the editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page using the Markdown editor and, when another user (with write access) loads the same page in the editor, the XSS payload is executed in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, or further attacks on other users.
*   **Limited Scope:** The exploit is limited to editors with write access who are loading the malicious page in the Markdown editor. The rendered result does not contain the XSS payload as the HTML sanitization module strips it during the final render.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Markdown Input:** The attacker crafts a Markdown document containing an XSS payload.
*   **Editor with Write Access:** An attacker with write access to the target page injects the malicious markdown.
*   **Second Editor:** The vulnerability is triggered when another editor loads the modified page into the Markdown editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to a page within the application.
*   **Knowledge of Markdown:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a Markdown payload that includes an XSS exploit.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The vulnerability requires another user with write access to load the maliciously modified page within the markdown editor.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Patch:** The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.3.81 with commit `05e8a71ceff39167aee830ba8ad5eb0161f2911a` by sanitizing the preview HTML using DOMPurify.
*   The fix adds `DOMPurify.sanitize()` to the preview HTML.
*   The vulnerability was reported by JoranHonig.
