    "summary": "The provided documents contain information about CVE-2020-11881, a vulnerability in the MikroTik SMB service that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted SMB negotiation request followed by a setup request with a specific MessageID (1) and SessionID (0). The service crashes due to its inability to handle this specific SessionID value. The content includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and information on affected versions.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The MikroTik SMB service crashes when it receives a crafted SMB `setup-request` packet with a MessageID set to 1 and a SessionID set to 0. The service is unable to handle the SessionID being 0.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The SMB service's inability to handle a SessionID of 0 in a `setup-request` packet.",
         "Lack of proper input validation in the SMB service."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash the running SMB service, resulting in a denial of service. This would disrupt file sharing capabilities and any services relying on it.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker sends a `negotiation-request` packet.",
        "The attacker follows up with a modified `setup-request` packet with a MessageID of 1 and a SessionID of 0."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the targeted MikroTik device running the vulnerable SMB service. No authentication is required.",
