Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11673

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a broken authentication vulnerability within the "Responsive Poll" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions 1.3.4 and earlier. The plugin fails to properly restrict access to several critical functions, allowing unauthenticated users to call them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is **broken access control** or **lack of authentication**. The plugin exposes multiple functions that should be restricted to administrative or logged-in users to any visitor of the website. These functions include:

- Functions for cloning, deleting, and editing polls and themes:
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Clone_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Del_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Edit_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Edit_Q_M_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Edit_Ans_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Theme_Clone_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Theme_Edit_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Theme_Edit1_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Clone_Set_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Edit_Set_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_Del_Set_Callback`
- Functions for voting and seeing results:
    - `TotalSoftPoll_1_Vote_Callback`
    - `TotalSoftPoll_1_Results_Callback`
- Other miscellaneous functions related to dismissing popups or previewing data:
    - `TS_PTable_New_MTable_DisMiss_Callback_Pol0l`
    - `TS_Poll_Question_DisMiss_Callback`
    - `Total_Soft_Poll_Prev_Callback`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data manipulation:** An attacker can clone, edit, or delete polls and themes, potentially altering poll data, changing the appearance of polls, or removing them completely. This can disrupt user engagement and lead to misinformation or defacement of the website.
- **Voting Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially cast arbitrary votes, thus manipulating the outcome of the polls.
- **Denial of Service:** By deleting polls, an attacker can cause content to disappear from the website.
- **Potential privilege escalation:** While not direct, manipulation of polls and themes could be a stepping stone to further attacks or compromise of the website

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is sending **unauthenticated POST requests** directly to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint of the WordPress site.
The `action` parameter in the POST request specifies the vulnerable function to be called.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target website.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates a POST request for deleting a poll. This vulnerability is not only limited to deletion, but also affects various other functions that should be restricted.
- The issue was reported in April 2020.
- The plugin's changelog indicates fixes for security issues in versions 2.4.0 and 2.4.3, which likely address this vulnerability, among others.
