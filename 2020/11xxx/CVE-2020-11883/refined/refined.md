Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the pull requests:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the server's handling of invalid JSON requests. When the server received a request with an invalid JSON body, it would throw an exception that included a full stack trace. This stack trace exposed sensitive information, such as:

*   Full file paths of the application on the server.
*   Names of node modules used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of internal server details through the stack trace in error responses. This falls under the category of "Information Exposure Through an Error Message".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Attackers could leverage the exposed file paths and module names to gain a better understanding of the application's architecture and identify potential weaknesses.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** This information could be used as a stepping stone for more targeted attacks, such as exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific libraries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Sending Invalid JSON:** The attack vector was sending a request with an invalid JSON body to the API endpoints that expect JSON content. This could be achieved by sending malformed JSON or simply not sending a valid JSON structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to be aware of API endpoints that are expected to receive JSON data, as sending invalid JSON to other endpoints might not trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content includes a curl command that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:

```
curl -i -s -k -X $'GET' -H $'Host: demo.storefrontcloud.io' -H $'Accept: */*' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'Origin: <https://demo.vuestorefront.io>' -H $'Content-Length: 2' --data-binary $'\x0d\x0a' $'<https://demo.storefrontcloud.io/api/cart/pull?token=&cartId=>'
```

This command sends a GET request with a Content-Type of "application/json" but provides a body that is not valid JSON (just a carriage return and a line feed).

The fix involved disabling the `showErrorStack` option, which would prevent the stack trace from being included in the response. Instead, a generic error message with a code was returned, as shown in the "after with disabled `showErrorStack`" section.

The content includes examples of responses before and after the fix as well as an example of the response when `showErrorStack` is enabled which is an option that can be changed in the configuration of the application.
