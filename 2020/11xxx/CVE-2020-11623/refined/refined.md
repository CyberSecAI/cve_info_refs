{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The AvertX IP cameras expose a UART interface that allows access to diagnostic and configuration functionalities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposed UART interface",
      "Lack of authentication on the UART interface"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers with physical access to the UART interface can access and modify additional configurations, reset the configuration, extract information, and even render the camera inoperable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the device",
       "Connection to the unpopulated 4-pin Molex connector which provides UART interface access"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Physical access to the device",
      "Knowledge of UART communication protocols",
        "Ability to connect to the UART interface using tools like an Attify Badge"
    ]
