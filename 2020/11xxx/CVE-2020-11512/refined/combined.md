Your IDX Broker-enabled account provides this plugin with access to your MLS data feed. The IMPress for IDX Broker plugin allows you to display that data on your WordPress site using widgets and shortcodes while seamlessly matching your brand.

## FAQ

### What is IDX?

Internet Data Exchange, or IDX, is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS’s website. IMPress for IDX Broker connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and then adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to your website(s).

### How does IDX Broker connect with the IMPress for IDX Broker plugin?

An IDX Broker API key (IDX Broker Account Required) provides the IMPress plugin with access to preset Widgets, search forms, an xml sitemap file, and much more.

### How is the IDX content hosted/updated?

IDX Broker hosts your IDX data on a subdomain (e.g., search.yoursite.com). This allows IDX Broker to update quickly, and offers a lightning-fast, co-brandable search engine for real estate professionals and WordPress designers regardless of the quality of the hosting solution that you are using for your website. Low quality, inexpensive hosting solutions often cannot process or manage the amount of data provided by an IDX feed.

### Why is IDX Broker hosted in the cloud?

All IDX feeds are hosted on high-quality GCP (Google Cloud Platform) servers with multiple layers of redundancy. This ensures that even if your hosted website (mysite.com) goes down, your IDX Broker pages (search.mysite.com) will almost always be available to visitors.

### What is a Wrapper and why does IDX Broker need to create a Wrapper page on my WordPress site?

The IMPress plugin offers an easy one-button option to create a Wrapper for IDX pages. This wrapper page is then used to magically update your IDX pages every hour, or whenever you modify/refresh your IDX Broker plugin page. This means less work for you or your website developer.

### Do I need an IDX Broker Lite or Platinum account in order to use this plugin?

Yes. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you (or your client if a designer) are not a member of a local board or MLS, or the MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IMPress for IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site.

### Is my service area available?

[Read more about our MLS coverage.](https://idxbroker.com/idx_mls_coverage) Note that some MLS’s may charge you a separate fee for access to your IDX feed.

### Does IDX Broker require a long-term contract like other IDX services?

No. IDX Broker requires a month-to-month agreement only.

### What is the pricing for IDX Broker services?

For updated pricing, please [visit our website](https://idxbroker.com/idx_broker) to compare the available account types.

### What can I expect if I decide to get my IDX feed through IDX Broker?

When you sign up for a new account our MLS team will send you a Docusign email (or PDF). Simply add your signature to the Docusign file or PDF in order to proceed. If you are not a Principal Broker, and have provided us with your Broker name and contact information, we will then forward the same paperwork to your Broker for approval. Once we receive the paperwork from your Broker, we will send it to the MLS for data approval. MLS approval can take anywhere from 3-10 days. Once approved, we will activate your account, integrate your site’s design into IDX pages, and send you IDX Broker login credentials so that you can use this plugin to add links and Widgets to your site or blog.

### How many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker?

Features provided by this Plugin – Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto any WordPress website or blog. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. Note that using iframes to display this same content is prohibited and may result in account termination due to MLS rules.

### What are Other Requirements for this Plugin?

This plugin requires PHP version 7.0 or higher. For security reasons, we recommend updating to the latest stable version of PHP your web host provides. We also recommend using the latest production version of WordPress. See [this article](https://support.idxbroker.com/s/article/wordpress-plugin) for more information.

### If I currently have IMPress Listings and/or IMPress Agents – what does the new plugin consolidation mean for me?

For users with IMPress 3.0+ who have legacy versions of IMPress Listings and/or IMPress Agents already installed, the plugins will continue to work as-is. However, if the user selects ‘Enable Listings’ or ‘Enable Agents’ in the new IMPress for IDX dashboard, the legacy IMPress Listings/Agents will be deactivated and the new consolidated version of the plugin will be used. Any existing data for Listings/Agents will be unaffected.

I wasted over $400 thinking that IDX Broker and this plugin would take care of my needs of integrating IDX into my self-hosted website. The documentation is almost non-existent, leaving you fumbling in the dark. Their website advertises included themes that should work well with this plugin, however, in 2024 these themes do not exist. I spent a fair amount of time on the phone with an IDX service tech who, when asked about the themes, stated “I don’t know, these were installed on my system when I started here.”The system as a whole is very clunky and outdated. Once you do get a search created, it will default to a subdomain in the idxbroker website instead of natively on your own. Overall bad experience and waste of money. If you really do want a self-hosted IDX website do some research and find a provider that is plug and play ready and doesn’t require countless hours of your time just to end up with a 10 year old looking website.

I’ve never felt compelled to leave a Wordpress review, but the service provided by IDXBroker is so non-existant I’ve felt the need the need to notify others that are considering this is as an IDX solution. They will take your money and quickly onboard your MLS feed, but after that, good luck getting a response to an e-mail. They simply ignore you. Plugin has not been updated in a long time. Free plugins have better support than this with a fairly high monthly subscription fee.

This is the best IDX plugin for Wordpress. Is it perfect? No, nothing is. But they have been really improving things for about the past year (new features, updated templates, etc.). The Market Reports feature is really nice and loved by many clients.
You can customize many things through the UI. With code you can customize just about anything.

It does indeed integrate with wordpress, however there are several “imperfections”
1. You can integrate ALL info, which completely overwrites any SEO efforts on a listing
2. All images will come in with the same title. Any local changes will be overwritten
3. “De-Unselecting” option to overwrite all results in ALL properties changing to SOLD status.
Integration should be based on property ID information with the option to select which information is updated upon synchronization.
Unless you are listing and turning many properties a week, this entire process is probably best to do manually

I decided to give this tool a try. The search was good, and although I had a few issues installing the plugin, it was not too bad. I was told that the IDX content was SEO friendly, but found that not to be the case. I was also very disappointed that I could not use cache tools to make my website faster. It seems that this plugin slowed my website down.

## Description

IMPress for IDX Broker is now the IMPress family of plugins all-in-one. [IMPress Listings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-listings/) and [IMPress Agents](https://wordpress.org/plugins/impress-agents/) have been consolidated with this already powerful plugin.

Your IDX Broker-enabled account provides this plugin with access to your MLS data feed. The IMPress for IDX Broker plugin allows you to display that data on your WordPress site using widgets and shortcodes while seamlessly matching your brand.

### IMPress for IDX Broker

#### Manage Your Leads

No more going between browser windows with the Lead Management interface. Now you can see and manage your leads right within the WordPress dashboard. Plus, you can use powerful lead capture tools to generate new leads. Go beyond and customize your lead capture settings with IDX Broker Platinum.

#### Form Integration

With IMPress for IDX Broker you can create forms within WordPress and capture lead information straight into IDX Broker. At launch, the integration includes several popular form plugins.

#### Native WordPress Widgets

Take advantage of powerful widgets to deliver the best experience, and style them to match the design of your site! You can add lead login, signup, city links, showcase, carousel and even map widgets. Easily add new widgets to pages and posts with built-in shortcodes.

#### Map Search Widget

Add a full-sized map search widget to ANY page on your domain. Create your own custom polygon searches with your IDX Broker Platinum account and allow visitors the ability to search within popular neighborhoods in your area.

#### Omnibar Search Widget

This widget allows you to add an Omnibar Search Widget to your home page. Visitors can then search by city, county, postal code, address, or listing ID. Custom Fields such as School or Subdivision can also be added. No other IDX solution offers this many options in a search widget for your home page.

#### Import Your Listings

You no longer have to manually enter your properties! Import all your IDX properties into WordPress without wasting time on tedious data entry. Plus, have them updated as the MLS changes – directly from your IDX Broker feed!

Control how your featured listings are presented on your real estate website. IMPress automatically creates individual listings pages for your imported properties that can be managed in your WordPress dashboard. These pages can be linked, shared or searched from anywhere else on your site.

#### Developer Themes

Only IMPress for IDX Broker gives you the ability to choose from a [gallery of premium WordPress themes](https://idxbroker.com/wordpress-idx-themes) created by our developer partners, designed specifically around use with your IDX Broker account. Choose any theme and IMPress for IDX Broker will seamlessly integrate into your IDX pages.

#### Google My Business

Connect IMPress for IDX Broker to your verified Google My Business profile to generate and schedule timely posts, photos of your listings, and more. The automatic scheduler can be used to create and share posts to highlight featured listings, open house announcements, recent sales, local expertise, and more.

Posts have the potential to bring leads and clients directly to your IDX-enabled website for more home search opportunities. Google My Business posts are archived on a weekly basis, so automating the process with the scheduler is an easy way to maintain your real estate business’s online presence.

*Automatic posting requires a verified Google My Business account with a verified location.*

#### Agent Directory

IMPress provides you with a full employee directory, that is ideal for Real Estate teams and offices. You can add a custom post type for employees with post meta fields for contact info and add taxonomies for Offices and Job Types to show employees by location and/or job title.

#### Optimized for IDX Broker

Your IDX Broker account provides this plugin with access to your MLS data feed – meaning you can effortlessly integrate IDX Broker features into your WordPress site.

IDX Broker Lite plans offer the essential features and functionality needed for home search. Platinum plans include all the features of Lite plus map search widgets, Market Reports, Sold Data, Polygon Searching and much more.

## FAQ

### What is IDX?

Internet Data Exchange, or IDX, is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS’s website. IMPress for IDX Broker connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and then adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to your website(s).

### How does IDX Broker connect with the IMPress for IDX Broker plugin?

An IDX Broker API key (IDX Broker Account Required) provides the IMPress plugin with access to preset Widgets, search forms, an xml sitemap file, and much more.

### How is the IDX content hosted/updated?

IDX Broker hosts your IDX data on a subdomain (e.g., search.yoursite.com). This allows IDX Broker to update quickly, and offers a lightning-fast, co-brandable search engine for real estate professionals and WordPress designers regardless of the quality of the hosting solution that you are using for your website. Low quality, inexpensive hosting solutions often cannot process or manage the amount of data provided by an IDX feed.

### Why is IDX Broker hosted in the cloud?

All IDX feeds are hosted on high-quality GCP (Google Cloud Platform) servers with multiple layers of redundancy. This ensures that even if your hosted website (mysite.com) goes down, your IDX Broker pages (search.mysite.com) will almost always be available to visitors.

### What is a Wrapper and why does IDX Broker need to create a Wrapper page on my WordPress site?

The IMPress plugin offers an easy one-button option to create a Wrapper for IDX pages. This wrapper page is then used to magically update your IDX pages every hour, or whenever you modify/refresh your IDX Broker plugin page. This means less work for you or your website developer.

### Do I need an IDX Broker Lite or Platinum account in order to use this plugin?

Yes. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you (or your client if a designer) are not a member of a local board or MLS, or the MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IMPress for IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site.

### Is my service area available?

[Read more about our MLS coverage.](https://idxbroker.com/idx_mls_coverage) Note that some MLS’s may charge you a separate fee for access to your IDX feed.

### Does IDX Broker require a long-term contract like other IDX services?

No. IDX Broker requires a month-to-month agreement only.

### What is the pricing for IDX Broker services?

For updated pricing, please [visit our website](https://idxbroker.com/idx_broker) to compare the available account types.

### What can I expect if I decide to get my IDX feed through IDX Broker?

When you sign up for a new account our MLS team will send you a Docusign email (or PDF). Simply add your signature to the Docusign file or PDF in order to proceed. If you are not a Principal Broker, and have provided us with your Broker name and contact information, we will then forward the same paperwork to your Broker for approval. Once we receive the paperwork from your Broker, we will send it to the MLS for data approval. MLS approval can take anywhere from 3-10 days. Once approved, we will activate your account, integrate your site’s design into IDX pages, and send you IDX Broker login credentials so that you can use this plugin to add links and Widgets to your site or blog.

### How many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker?

Features provided by this Plugin – Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto any WordPress website or blog. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. Note that using iframes to display this same content is prohibited and may result in account termination due to MLS rules.

### What are Other Requirements for this Plugin?

This plugin requires PHP version 7.0 or higher. For security reasons, we recommend updating to the latest stable version of PHP your web host provides. We also recommend using the latest production version of WordPress. See [this article](https://support.idxbroker.com/s/article/wordpress-plugin) for more information.

### If I currently have IMPress Listings and/or IMPress Agents – what does the new plugin consolidation mean for me?

For users with IMPress 3.0+ who have legacy versions of IMPress Listings and/or IMPress Agents already installed, the plugins will continue to work as-is. However, if the user selects ‘Enable Listings’ or ‘Enable Agents’ in the new IMPress for IDX dashboard, the legacy IMPress Listings/Agents will be deactivated and the new consolidated version of the plugin will be used. Any existing data for Listings/Agents will be unaffected.

I wasted over $400 thinking that IDX Broker and this plugin would take care of my needs of integrating IDX into my self-hosted website. The documentation is almost non-existent, leaving you fumbling in the dark. Their website advertises included themes that should work well with this plugin, however, in 2024 these themes do not exist. I spent a fair amount of time on the phone with an IDX service tech who, when asked about the themes, stated “I don’t know, these were installed on my system when I started here.”The system as a whole is very clunky and outdated. Once you do get a search created, it will default to a subdomain in the idxbroker website instead of natively on your own. Overall bad experience and waste of money. If you really do want a self-hosted IDX website do some research and find a provider that is plug and play ready and doesn’t require countless hours of your time just to end up with a 10 year old looking website.

I’ve never felt compelled to leave a Wordpress review, but the service provided by IDXBroker is so non-existant I’ve felt the need the need to notify others that are considering this is as an IDX solution. They will take your money and quickly onboard your MLS feed, but after that, good luck getting a response to an e-mail. They simply ignore you. Plugin has not been updated in a long time. Free plugins have better support than this with a fairly high monthly subscription fee.

This is the best IDX plugin for Wordpress. Is it perfect? No, nothing is. But they have been really improving things for about the past year (new features, updated templates, etc.). The Market Reports feature is really nice and loved by many clients.
You can customize many things through the UI. With code you can customize just about anything.

It does indeed integrate with wordpress, however there are several “imperfections”
1. You can integrate ALL info, which completely overwrites any SEO efforts on a listing
2. All images will come in with the same title. Any local changes will be overwritten
3. “De-Unselecting” option to overwrite all results in ALL properties changing to SOLD status.
Integration should be based on property ID information with the option to select which information is updated upon synchronization.
Unless you are listing and turning many properties a week, this entire process is probably best to do manually

I decided to give this tool a try. The search was good, and although I had a few issues installing the plugin, it was not too bad. I was told that the IDX content was SEO friendly, but found that not to be the case. I was also very disappointed that I could not use cache tools to make my website faster. It seems that this plugin slowed my website down.

# Vulnerabilities Patched in IMPress for IDX Broker

On February 28, 2020, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team became aware of a newly patched stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in [IMPress for IDX Broker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/idx-broker-platinum), a WordPress plugin with over 10,000 installations. Although all Wordfence users, including those still using the free version of Wordfence, were already protected from this vulnerability by the Web Application Firewall’s built-in XSS protection, we investigated the plugin further and discovered an additional stored XSS vulnerability. We also found a flaw that would allow an authenticated attacker with minimal, subscriber-level permissions to permanently delete any page or post on the site, in addition to creating pages with arbitrary titles.

We initially reached out to the plugin’s vendor the same day, on February 28, 2020, but received no response over an extended period of time. On March 19, 2020, after notifying the WordPress plugin team, we received a response from the plugin’s developer, at which time we sent the full disclosure details. A fully patched version was released on March 23, 2020, and we recommend updating to the latest version, 2.6.2, immediately.

Wordfence Premium users received a new firewall rule on March 2nd to protect against exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Free Wordfence users will receive this rule on April 1, 2020.

**Description:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)

**Affected Plugin:** [IMPress for IDX Broker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/idx-broker-platinum)

**Plugin Slug:** idx-broker-platinum

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.6.1

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11512

**CVSS Score:** 7.4 (high)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.6.2

The IMPress for IDX Broker plugin contains a captcha feature to prevent spam submissions. Since it uses Google’s ReCAPTCHA service, it requires an API key. Unfortunately, the AJAX action the plugin registered to update this API key did not use capability checks or nonce checks.

This made it  possible for a logged-in attacker with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to send a request to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the `action` parameter set to `idx_update_recaptcha_key` and the `idx_recaptcha_site_key` parameter set to a malicious JavaScript, which could then be executed in an administrator’s browser the next time they visited the plugin’s settings panel.

As with most attacks taking advantage of stored XSS in admin areas, this could be used to make use of the administrator’s session in order to create a new, malicious administrative user.

The AJAX action:

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_idx_update_recaptcha_key', array( $this, 'idx_update_recaptcha_key' ) );
```

The vulnerable function:

```
	public function idx_update_recaptcha_key() {
		if ( $_POST['idx_recaptcha_site_key'] ) {
			update_option( 'idx_recaptcha_site_key', $_POST['idx_recaptcha_site_key'], false );
			echo 1;
		} else {
			delete_option( 'idx_recaptcha_site_key' );
			echo 'error';
		}
		die();
	}
```

**Description:** Authenticated Post Creation, Modification, and Deletion

**Affected Plugin:** [IMPress for IDX Broker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/idx-broker-platinum)

**Plugin Slug:** idx-broker-platinum

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.6.1

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9514

**CVSS score:** 8.1(high)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.6.2

One of the features included with the IDX Broker plugin is the ability to create and delete “dynamic pages,” intended to ensure that any IDX pages match the site’s style and branding.

The plugin registers 2 AJAX actions that are used to do this:

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_create_dynamic_page', array( $this, 'idx_ajax_create_dynamic_page' ) );
```
```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_delete_dynamic_page', array( $this, 'idx_ajax_delete_dynamic_page' ) );
```

Once again, neither of the functions called by these AJAX actions used capability checks or nonce checks. As such it was possible for an authenticated attacker with minimal, subscriber-level, permissions to send a request to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the `action` parameter set to `create_dynamic_page` and the `post_title` parameter set to any arbitrary value. In return, a new dynamic page with that title would be created.

If a `wrapper_page_id` parameter was included and set to the ID of an existing post or page, that post or page would be replaced with a blank wrapper page:

```
	public function idx_ajax_create_dynamic_page() {

		// default page content
		$post_content = $this->does_theme_include_idx_tag();

		$post_title = $_POST['post_title'] ? $_POST['post_title'] : 'Properties';
		$new_post   = array(
			'post_title'   => $post_title,
			'post_name'    => $post_title,
			'post_content' => $post_content,
			'post_type'    => 'idx-wrapper',
			'post_status'  => 'publish',
		);
		if ( $_POST['wrapper_page_id'] ) {
			$new_post['ID'] = $_POST['wrapper_page_id'];
		}
		$wrapper_page_id = wp_insert_post( $new_post );
		update_option( 'idx_broker_dynamic_wrapper_page_name', $post_title, false );
		update_option( 'idx_broker_dynamic_wrapper_page_id', $wrapper_page_id, false );
		$wrapper_page_url = get_permalink( $wrapper_page_id );
		$this->idx_api->set_wrapper( 'global', $wrapper_page_url );
		update_post_meta( $wrapper_page_id, 'idx-wrapper-page', 'global' );

		die(
			json_encode(
				array(
					'wrapper_page_id'   => $wrapper_page_id,
					'wrapper_page_name' => $post_title,
				)
			)
		);
	}
```

Alternatively, if the attacker set the `action` parameter to `delete_dynamic_page` and sent a `wrapper_page_id` parameter with the ID of an existing post or page, then that post or page would be permanently deleted:

```
	public function idx_ajax_delete_dynamic_page() {
		if ( $_POST['wrapper_page_id'] ) {
			wp_delete_post( $_POST['wrapper_page_id'], true );
			wp_trash_post( $_POST['wrapper_page_id'] );
		}
		die();
	}
```

  Is it possible to list registered AJAX actions, and then perform a scan of these functions (the files containing them) to see if they at least perform the basic nonce check? This is getting ridiculous!

  Similarly, is it possible to enforce at least minimal capability checking to get into the admin area, or something? Like, if a plugin didn't do that, it'd be impossible to interact with it at all... (except enabling/disabling, of course)

  Hi Kadigan!

  When manually hunting for vulnerabilities, we regularly search through the files in a plugin for registered AJAX actions and check the associated functions. An automated scan for this type of thing probably wouldn't be practical, however, since many plugins use their own custom nonce and capability checking functions. Additionally, many AJAX actions are actually intended to be available to all site visitors, or all logged in users - even when manually reviewing a plugin, it's sometimes difficult to tell which user roles should be allowed to access certain functions. Finally, some plugins use non-standard methods to register AJAX actions - a manual review can find these, but it would be difficult scan for them automatically. As far as capability checking to get into the admin area is concerned, we've found that most plugins do a fairly good job of capability checking when it comes to actually displaying or loading menu pages containing sensitive functionality - subscribers typically only have access to update their own profiles.
