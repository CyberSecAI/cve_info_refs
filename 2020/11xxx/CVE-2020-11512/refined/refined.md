Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-11512:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The plugin's AJAX action for updating the ReCAPTCHA API key lacks proper capability checks and nonce checks. This allows unauthorized users to modify this setting.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the ReCAPTCHA API key setting. This script will then execute in the browser of any administrator who visits the plugin's settings page, leading to potential session hijacking and further compromise.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Admin Browser:** The attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the administrator's browser, enabling actions with admin privileges such as creating new malicious administrative accounts.
*   **Account Takeover:**  The attacker can potentially hijack the admin's session and gain complete control of the website.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed by sending a malicious POST request to the WordPress `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Authentication Required**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with minimal permissions, like a subscriber.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a registered user on the affected WordPress site.
*   The attacker does not require elevated privileges and can execute this attack from a subscriber role.
*   The attacker needs to know the AJAX action name to target (`idx_update_recaptcha_key`).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content also discusses another vulnerability (CVE-2020-9514), allowing authenticated users to create/modify/delete pages, which is a separate issue and not related to CVE-2020-11512.
*  The information provided is more detailed than the typical CVE description by providing the vulnerable code snippets and a breakdown of the attack vectors and requirements.
