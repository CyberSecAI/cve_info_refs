Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-11437:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unsafe SQL string building in the `interface/patient_file/letter.php` source code, specifically within the `letter.php` endpoint. The application directly incorporates the `form_from` and `form_to` POST parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability exists in the `form_from` and `form_to` POST parameters of the `letter.php` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to retrieve sensitive data from the database. This includes medical records, user information, and potentially other confidential data stored within the LibreHealth application database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `letter.php` endpoint.
- Attackers can manipulate the `form_from` and `form_to` parameters to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the LibreHealth application, even a low-privileged user such as one in the "Front Desk" group.
- No special permissions or access are required beyond a valid user account.
