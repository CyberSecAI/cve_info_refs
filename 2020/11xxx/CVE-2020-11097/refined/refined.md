Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-11097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An out-of-bounds read occurs when accessing the `PRIMARY_DRAWING_ORDER_FIELD_BYTES` array in FreeRDP. This indicates that the code attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory for the array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when a program tries to access a memory location outside the bounds of an allocated buffer or array. It can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The out-of-bounds read could potentially leak sensitive information stored in memory adjacent to the `PRIMARY_DRAWING_ORDER_FIELD_BYTES` array.
*   **Denial of Service:** A crash due to an out-of-bounds read can lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the client or server unavailable.
*   **Possible Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be chained to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. This depends on factors like memory layout and the specific system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by a malicious RDP server sending specially crafted drawing orders to a vulnerable client, or vice-versa, if the server is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted RDP data to the targeted FreeRDP client or server.
*   **Malicious Server or Client:** The attacker would either need to control the RDP server to send malicious data to a client or control the client in order to send malicious data to the server, depending on the exploitation scenario.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires relatively low privileges, and does not need user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. In the SUSE information, the CVSS v3 vector for the vulnerability is AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is located within the NTLM authentication protocol implementation of FreeRDP.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in FreeRDP version 2.1.2.
*   Multiple vendors and projects address the vulnerability in their products.

This information is compiled from the various sources you provided, which include descriptions from SUSE, GitHub, and Fedora. These resources show that the issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, with a medium severity rating which is present in older versions of the freerdp library.
