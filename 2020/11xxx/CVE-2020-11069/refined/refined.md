Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11069

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Same-Origin Request Forgery (SORF), which is similar to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) but occurs within the same origin. It's triggered by a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Same-Origin Request Forgery (SORF):**  The core issue is that the TYPO3 backend user interface and install tool are susceptible to SORF attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not the primary vulnerability, the SORF is triggered by an XSS vulnerability, which is used to inject malicious scripts.
- **Lack of Proper Referrer Validation:** The application does not properly validate the HTTP Referer header, which allows malicious requests to be made.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in backend user into performing unintended actions with their privileges.
- In a worst-case scenario, attackers can create new administrator users.
- Malicious scripts can be executed within the context of the victim's session.
-  Attackers can potentially modify security-relevant database tables if sudo mode is not enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Resource Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads to the webserver, either through authenticated backend users or by exploiting third-party extensions (e.g., file uploads in a contact form).
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers trick backend users into interacting with the malicious resource (e.g., by clicking a link).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Upload Malicious Content:** Attackers need a way to upload malicious HTML/JavaScript files to the server, either through legitimate means (if they have backend access) or through vulnerabilities in third-party extensions.
- **User Interaction:** Requires the victim to have an active and valid TYPO3 backend or install tool user session and be tricked into interacting with the malicious payload.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to host or inject the malicious payload and have the victim access it.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** TYPO3 versions 9.0.0 to 9.5.16 and 10.0.0 to 10.4.1 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in TYPO3 versions 9.5.17 and 10.4.2.
- **Mitigation:** The primary fix is to enforce proper HTTP Referer header validation to ensure that requests originated from the TYPO3 backend user interface or install tool.
- **Additional mitigations:** The advisory also suggests using the "Sudo Mode" extension and implementing a Content Security Policy to mitigate the risk. The sudo mode extension prompts for password re-entry for security-related database changes. CSP helps block script executions from untrusted locations, for example file uploads.

This vulnerability is rated as **High** severity.
