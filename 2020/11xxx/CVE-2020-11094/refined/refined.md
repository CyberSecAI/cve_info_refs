Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `debugbar-plugin` for OctoberCMS, when enabled, logs all requests and associated information (including session data). If the plugin is enabled on a system accessible to untrusted users, this feature becomes a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The plugin stores sensitive request and session data, which can be viewed by unauthorized users if the plugin is enabled on a public-facing system.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** Prior to the patch, access to the debugbar and its stored request data was not properly restricted, leading to potential unauthorized access.
*   **Account Takeover Potential:**  Exploitation of the information disclosure vulnerability could lead to account takeovers of authenticated users by non-authenticated public users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data contained in requests and user sessions, including potentially personal information, API keys, or other secrets.
*   **Account Compromise:** Attackers could potentially obtain session tokens or other authentication data, enabling them to hijack user accounts.
*   **System Compromise:** If conditions exist, the attackers can gain full access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:**  An attacker needs to access a system where the vulnerable debugbar plugin is enabled and exposed publicly. This is generally a web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application where the vulnerable plugin is active.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Before the fix, access was possible even without authenticating to the application.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix (v3.1.0) restricts debugbar access to authenticated backend users with specific permissions.
*   The stored request information feature is also restricted behind a more restrictive permission.
* The patch also includes styling improvements.
* A commit (86dd29f) is available for manual application if upgrading isn't possible.
