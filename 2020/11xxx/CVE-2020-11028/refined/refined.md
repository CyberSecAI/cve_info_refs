Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-11028:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw where some private posts, which were previously public, can become accessible without authentication under specific conditions. The content doesn't specify the exact mechanism that causes this disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Unauthenticated disclosure of content intended to be private. This means users are able to see private posts without logging in.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Unauthorized access to private information, which was previously public, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is not explicitly defined, however, it involves a specific set of conditions that enables unauthenticated access to private posts.  The vulnerability arises from how WordPress handles the transition of public posts to private status, causing a situation where private posts that were once public remain visible to unauthenticated users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker does not require authentication and only needs to exploit a specific condition within the WordPress installation to access previously public but now private posts.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 5.4.1 and through minor releases of older versions.
- The severity is considered "Low".
- The content from `lists.debian.org` confirms the vulnerability and its fix in Debian.
