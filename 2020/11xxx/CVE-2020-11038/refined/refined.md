Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11038:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the size calculation when allocating a buffer for video redirection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Integer Overflow: The client calculates the buffer size using a calculation that is susceptible to an integer overflow. This results in a smaller buffer being allocated than the server intends.
*   Out-of-bounds write: Subsequently, the server manipulates the client to write data past the boundary of the undersized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to:
    *   Memory corruption
    *   Potentially arbitrary code execution
    *   Denial of service (crash)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious or compromised RDP server.
*   The attack is triggered by a crafted video redirection command/data from the server to the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control or have access to a malicious RDP server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted video redirection data to the client.
*   No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects FreeRDP clients that use the `/video` redirection option.
*   The vulnerability was patched in FreeRDP version 2.1.0.
*   A workaround is to disable video redirection on the client side using the `/video` option.
