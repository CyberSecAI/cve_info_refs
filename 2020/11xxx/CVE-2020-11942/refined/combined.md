| Enterprise | Improvement | Baselines | Make Baselines templates look as per other endpoint templates. |
| Community | Improvement | Groups | Allow for 'normal' /groups/<id>?action=execute URL as per other endpoints. |
| **Professional** | Improvement | Database | New menu option. Admin → Database → Schema Compare. Checks the schema of the in-use database against the definition supplied as a file and highlights differences. |
| Professional | Improvement | All | Add the name of the object to the title bar if we're viewing an execute or read template. |
| **Cloud** | Improvement | Tasks | Implement working tasks for all customers for Cloud. |

| **Professional** | [Improvement](/wiki/spaces/OA/blog/2020/01/14/3163950374/Device%2BListing%2BImprovements%2BProfessional%2BCloud%2Band%2BEnterprise) | Devices | Provide a global ***default columns retrieval*** list and ***default columns show*** list. Default columns show can be overwritten per user. Allow on the /devices page to show/hide columns and save as the users default columns list. |
| **Professional** | [Improvement](/wiki/spaces/OA/blog/2020/01/14/3163950374/Device%2BListing%2BImprovements%2BProfessional%2BCloud%2Band%2BEnterprise) | Devices | Refine the devices collection template to hide/show the sub\_resource items. Refine the sub\_resource templates and add another for viewing a single sub\_resource entry. |
| Professional | Improvement | Devices | Add task to the device display left side menu. |
| Enterprise | Improvement | Integrations | Add Last Run to Integrations Collection template. |
| **Community** | Improvement | Discoveries | Add sudo password on credentials templates. Use new 'sudo\_password' when using ssh\_key credentials, if populated. Revise SSH timeouts when using sudo. The old "password" field, on a credentials entry for an SSH Key, was used both for the key itself (if encrypted) and also for the sudo password. This didn't work when they we different (ie, most of the time). If the SSH Key had no password, it worked as expected. |
| Professional | Improvement | Configuration | Remove oae\_password from being used. Set password to '', effectively barring logon (new installs only). |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Only allow JPG, PNG and SVG files to be uploaded as device images. |
| Professional | Bug | Devices | Fix displayed text for Audit My PC link on Linux. |
| Community | Improvement | LDAP Servers | Add new attribute for ldap\_servers - use\_auth. |
| Professional | Improvement | Discoveries | Minor refinements to the discoveries\_read template. |
| **Professional** | Improvement | Discoveries | Add open|filtered to the discovery scan options with a default of 'n'. Previously we used the "filtered" column to check for open|filtered. This change aligns the discovery scan options with Nmap return strings. |
| Professional | Bug | Racks | System detail button on rack visualization does not work in Firefox. |
| Professional | Improvement | Discoveries | Add time for Scanning for Nmap response to discoveries::read template. |
| Professional | Improvement | Clusters | Add clusters endpoint. |
| Professional | Improvement | Devices | Buttons to clear change logs and audit logs for a device. |
| Professional | Improvement | All | Warn if deleting a collection item, that it will also delete any associated tasks. |
| Professional | Improvement | Devices | Show processor hyperthreading, socket and architecture on devices read template. |
| **Community** | Improvement | Discoveries | Remove network address, add open|filtered to discoveries create and read templates. |
| **Community** | Improvement | Devices | Implement code to delete a device from the database when config item set and status changed to deleted. |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Add nmis\_customer to integrations (and database). |
| Professional | Improvement | Devices | Un-managed Devices Menu Entry and Edit. |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Retrieve more linux user information (home, shell, ssh Keys). |
| Community | Improvement | All | A large amount of code formatting to adhere to the include code sniffer (see /other/PHPCS\_Coding\_Standard). |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Add deprecation notice to devices::collection template for running a Query based on a Group. |
| Community | Improvement | Configuration | Allow filters in /configuration (particularly for [configuration.name](http://configuration.name)), mostly for the API. |
| Professional | Improvement | Widgets | Add server.edition to Server Types summary. |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Remove the 'default' route (for 0.0.0.0) as it already shows in 'ip r' and it also may have more than one for 0.0.0.0 with different weights, think VPN. |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Add Seagate identifier for Manufacturer to linux disks. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Don't use the timeout (2m), hard set to 10 seconds for SSH login. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Sort the meta->data order. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Mac Models added. |
| **Community** | Improvement | Discoveries | Revise SSH timeouts when using sudo. Only use configured limit for the audit script (otherwise a simple delete file has to timeout). Timeout was defaulting to 10mins, regardless of setting. I had to explicitly set this for each ssh->read command. Discovery using this went from 365 seconds to 165 seconds for a single host. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Use self-delete on SSH audit scripts running via discovery. |
| Community | Improvement | Users | Accept username and password via request headers in m\_logon. |
| Community | Improvement | Configuration | Code added to check\_defaults to set default\_network\_address based on determined server IP, if not already set by the user. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Massive (code) shake up of how we do Collections (and a bit of READ, too). No more m\_collections::collection or My\_Model::collection\_sql used. Each collection now responsible for it's own items. Every model has a collection function that takes either a user or response. We can now call each for either a straight list of items the user can see or a full response with column list, exclusions, et al as per the API. |
| Community | Improvement | Users | Remove nmis user from default user list. |
| Community | Bug | Discoveries | Use correct argument order in explode function for UUID retrieval via SSH. |
| **Community** | Improvement | Discoveries | New discovery routine using the queue. We now have a "discovery queue". Each IP is scanned NOT by discover\_subnet.vbs||sh, now it's directly in PHP. We have effectively deprecated the discover\_subnet scripts as at 3.3.0. We create a new entry per IP in a queue and loop over those, with a default number of spawned processes set to 20 (configurable). Discovery times have again sped up by a large amount and if your network and Open-AudIT server allow it, you can increase the default queue limit and gain even more. |
| Community | Bug | Discoveries | For service items, include the 'port' in the match. We were matching on name + type only, which failed when we have multiple websites, same names, different ports (80 + 443). |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Remove 'manufacturer' from discover\_subnet.sh as we don't use it and when it contains an ampersand, it seems to fail validations - even if we enclose it in CDATA. |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Automatically filter any devices without oae\_manage = 'y' when requesting from Enterprise. |
| Community | Bug | Discoveries | Fix bug in audit\_linux.sh relating to Docker machine detection (thanks David). |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Add config option called match\_ip\_no\_data. If we discover a device and that IP is already in the database AND we have no audit data about that device, assuming it is the same device, do not create another (usually duplicate) device. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | For service items, include the 'port' in the match. We were matching on name + type only, which failed when we have multiple websites, same names, different ports (80 + 443). |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Add processor.hyperthreading to DB schema. |
| Community | Bug | Discoveries | Linux audit fix for log size from danf0x. Thanks Dan. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Improved IIS 7 and above enumeration. Only for local audit. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | ESXi audit script - fix memory\_count, domain and format os\_installation\_date as a date, not a timestamp. Correctly format manufacurer name for VMware, Inc. SSH Helper, better attribute retrieval to match the audit script for ESXi. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | After SSH attribute retrieval, if populated, use these in preference to previously obtained values (SNMP, Nmap, etc.) |
| Community | Bug | Discoveries | Correct argument order to split FQDN into hostname and domain. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | When running an audit script via discovery using sudo, no longer timeout to discovery\_ssh\_timeout, parse, then wait for the respone until we see 'Audit Completed' in the output - or wait for the timeout. Output the script output to the discovery\_log if log\_level = 7. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Retrieve routes via SNMP if count is below config item discovery\_route\_retrieve\_limit. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Improve input helper for better user input validation.  Provide a list of valid sub\_resources and validate request against it.  Ensure valid groupby provided.  Improve setting IDs. Ensure integers and comma's only.  Improve setting properties.  Improve setting sort.  Force sub\_resource\_id to an integer type. |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Add memory.manufacturer to SQL schema, retrieve on Linux. |
| Community | Change | All | Remove 'group' from the list of properties for input and use. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Add option of properties=all or properties=\* for all endpoints, which provides all SQL columns, the output of which is fully qualified name in the JSON. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Include log in debug output if meta->debug is true and set log\_level to 7. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | In m\_device::match, provide an array of ignored strings. Eg - 'To be filled by O.E.M.', which in a serial number frequently causes a false positive match. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Remove a lot of added text from attributes in order to match ssh with ssh\_audit values. Make some attributes in audit linx script, identical to those retrieved from in-app discovery. |
| Community | Bug | NMIS | Fix nmis import. Set org\_id and location\_id and redirect to a valid URL. |
| Community | Improvement | Rules | Add two new rules (HP -> Hewlett Packard) and (innotek GmbH -> Virtual). |
| Community | Improvement | Groups | Improve Group definitions for Printers, Debian Computers and Public IP Devices |
| Professional | Improvement | Devices | Provide a DHCP section on devices\_read template |
| All | Improvement | All | Requesting create\_form in JSON now provides everything required to build a suitable POST request. New function in all models called dictionary (used by controller/create\_form and util/dictionary). |
| Community | Improvement | Database | Add errors, warnings and notices to DB upgrade output screen. |
| Professional | Improvement | Logs | Refine the View Logs by Summary to only show create, update or delete actions by default (data altering requests). |
| Community | Improvement | All | PHPDocs for most functions added. |
| Professional | Improvement | Discoveries | Randomly discoveries will take ~60 seconds to start. Add a notice if status not empty and logs empty on discoveries read template. |
