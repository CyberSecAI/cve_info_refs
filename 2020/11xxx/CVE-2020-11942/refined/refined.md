Based on the provided document, which is a release note for Open-AudIT v3.3.0, there is no direct mention of a specific CVE-ID. However, it does contain many bug fixes and improvements related to security and functionality which could potentially address existing vulnerabilities:

**Improvements with Potential Security Relevance:**

*   **Sudo Password Handling:**  The Community version improvement in "Discoveries" addresses the issue of inconsistent handling of SSH key passwords and sudo passwords. The old "password" field was used for both, leading to problems when they differed. A new 'sudo\_password' field is introduced.
    *   **Weakness:** Inconsistent credential handling, potentially leading to failed or insecure sudo operations.
    *   **Mitigation:** Introducing a separate 'sudo_password' field fixes this.
*   **SSH Timeouts:** The document highlights adjustments to SSH timeouts, specifically when using sudo. Previously, timeouts could default to 10 minutes regardless of configured settings, potentially causing delays or issues in discovery processes.
    *   **Weakness:** Inefficient handling of SSH timeouts, potentially leading to performance issues.
    *   **Mitigation:** Explicitly setting SSH timeouts and optimizing the handling of sudo operations leading to a reduction from 365 to 165 seconds for single host discovery.
* **File Upload Validation:** The Community version improvement related to "Devices" that only allows JPG, PNG and SVG files to be uploaded as device images.
    * **Weakness:** Lack of file type validation could lead to malicious file uploads.
    * **Mitigation:** Limiting the allowed file types.
*  **Input Validation:** Improvements to input validation, such as validating sub_resources and ensuring integer types could help prevent injection-based attacks and improve overall security.
    * **Weakness:** Poor Input validation can cause various security vulnerabilities such as SQL injections.
    * **Mitigation:** Validating input sub_resources, integer types and providing specific error codes when validation fails can stop a wide variety of attacks.
*  **Authentication**: The ability to accept username and password via request headers in `m_logon`, although mentioned as an improvement, could have security implications if not implemented properly.

**Bug Fixes with Potential Security Relevance:**

*   **Docker Machine Detection:** Fixes a bug in `audit_linux.sh` relating to Docker machine detection. While not directly a security fix, it addresses an issue in a data-gathering script, which can be critical to accurate security posture assessment.
    * **Weakness:** Inaccurate information gathering.
    * **Mitigation:** The fix ensures accurate data about Docker machines is gathered.
*  **NMIS Import**: The bug fix for NMIS import, which sets org\_id and location\_id correctly can be considered as fixing a potential security concern by implementing proper access control.
    * **Weakness:** Lack of access control can lead to information disclosure.
    * **Mitigation:** The fix ensures proper assignment of organizational and location IDs.

**Other Notable Changes**

*   **Discovery Queue:** The introduction of a "discovery queue" using PHP instead of shell scripts. This could lead to more consistent and secure discovery processes.
    *   **Improvement:** Deprecating shell scripts and using PHP.

**Missing Information:**

*   There is no specific CVE ID mentioned in the release notes.
*   The provided document does not provide enough information to pinpoint specific vulnerabilities and the methods to exploit them.

**Conclusion:**

While the provided document doesn't contain information directly related to CVE-2020-11942, it does highlight several security-relevant changes in Open-AudIT v3.3.0. These primarily concern improved credential handling, timeout management, input validation, and bug fixes within audit scripts and database interactions.
