Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11100:

**1. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in HAProxy's handling of HTTP/2 headers, specifically within the HPACK decoder. The issue allowed an attacker to write arbitrary bytes around a specific location on the heap.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Heap out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is the potential to write arbitrary data to the heap outside the allocated memory region, due to incorrect handling of HTTP/2 headers.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most likely impact is a denial-of-service attack where HAProxy crashes, as a direct result of memory corruption and an out-of-bounds write.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** While less probable in most real-world scenarios, the vulnerability could, under specific and controlled circumstances, lead to arbitrary code execution. This is because the attacker can control the bytes being written, though not the absolute address on the heap where data is written.

**4. Attack vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP/2 requests sent over the network to the HAProxy server.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Remote Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the network.
- **HTTP/2 Knowledge:** The attacker needs a understanding of HTTP/2 protocol and its HPACK header compression to craft malicious requests.
- **Ability to Send HTTP/2 Requests:** The attacker must be able to send or generate HTTP/2 requests to the targeted HAProxy instance.

**Additional Technical details (beyond the scope of the CVE description):**

- **HPACK Decoder Flaw:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the HPACK (Header Compression for HTTP/2) decoder implementation of HAProxy.
- **32-bit Relative Address Space:** One source mentions "arbitrary writes into a 32-bit relative address space," suggesting the vulnerability might be more easily exploitable in 32-bit environments.
- **Heap-based Corruption:** All sources confirm that the memory corruption occurs on the heap.
- **No Configuration-Based Workaround for v2.1+ :** There is no configuration workaround for the vulnerability in HAProxy version 2.1 and higher.  Upgrading to a patched version is the only recommended solution for these.
- **Disclosure Delay:** Google Project Zero responsibly reported the issue and agreed to delay publication for a period to allow for fixes and updates to be deployed.
- **Patch Details:** The patch involves ensuring the "headroom" (available space before the beginning of the allocated memory) is properly accounted for only when the buffer does not wrap, specifically within `src/hpack-tbl.c`.

The content suggests a significant vulnerability that could cause serious security issues, especially in high-availability systems using HAProxy. It warrants immediate action from users to update their systems to the patched versions.
