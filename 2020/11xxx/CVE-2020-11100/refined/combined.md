Package        : haproxy
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-11100

Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered that HAProxy, a TCP/HTTP
reverse proxy, did not properly handle HTTP/2 headers. This would allow
an attacker to write arbitrary bytes around a certain location on the
heap, resulting in denial-of-service or potential arbitrary code
execution.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.19-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.

For the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-13fd8b1721
2020-04-28 02:55:39.874660
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : haproxy
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 2.0.14
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.haproxy.org/>
Summary : HAProxy reverse proxy for high availability environments
Description :
HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy which is particularly suited for high
availability environments. Indeed, it can:
- route HTTP requests depending on statically assigned cookies
- spread load among several servers while assuring server persistence
through the use of HTTP cookies
- switch to backup servers in the event a main one fails
- accept connections to special ports dedicated to service monitoring
- stop accepting connections without breaking existing ones
- add, modify, and delete HTTP headers in both directions
- block requests matching particular patterns
- report detailed status to authenticated users from a URI
intercepted from the application

| [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c13)  Robert Frohl   2020-04-02 13:15:23 UTC  ``` HAProxy was released on 2020/04/02.  The main driver for this release is that it contains a fix for a serious vulnerability that was responsibly reported last week by Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero, affecting the HPACK decoder used for HTTP/2. CVE-2020-11100 was assigned to this issue.  There is no configuration-based workaround for 2.1 and above.  This vulnerability makes it possible under certain circumstances to write to a wide range of memory locations within the process' heap, with the limitation that the attacker doesn't control the absolute address, so the most likely result and by a far margin will be a process crash, but it is not possible to completely rule out the faint possibility of a remote code execution, at least in a lab-controlled environment. Felix was kind enough to agree to delay the publication of his findings to the 20th of this month in order to leave enough time to haproxy users to apply updates. But please do not wait, as it is not very difficult to figure how to exploit the bug based on the fix. Distros were notified and will also have fixes available very shortly. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c14)  Robert Frohl   2020-04-02 13:15:43 UTC  ``` public via mailinglist ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-02 14:20:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1168023) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/790908> Factory / haproxy <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/790909> 15.2 / haproxy ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-02 16:20:42 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:0851-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

OpenShift Container Platform versions through 4.3 contain the vulnerable code; exploitation requires setting ROUTER_USE_HTTP2 in the OpenShift Ingress Operator, which is not currently possible. The impact of this vulnerability is therefore reduced in OCP 4.x, prior to version 4.4, to low.  OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 added a configuration option to ose-haproxy-router that made enabling HTTP/2 support easy. However, it is not enabled by default on that version.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1819111#c27)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2020-04-02 15:24:46 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This issue can be mitigated by not enabling support for HTTP/2 protocol. Upstream suggests that HTTP/2 can be enabled per front-end server by using the following documentation: <https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/hapee/1-8r1/traffic-management/enable-http2-protocol/>.  You can check if http2 is enabled by searching your haproxy configuration files for a line containing 'h2'.  To mitigate this vulnerability in OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, keep HTTP/2 disabled as it is by default. You can verify if HTTP/2 support is enabled or not by following the instructions in following article: <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/haproxy>  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, haproxy is confined by SELinux, which should mitigate remote arbitrary code execution.   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1819111#c41)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-02 16:31:59 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Package        : haproxy
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-11100

Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered that HAProxy, a TCP/HTTP
reverse proxy, did not properly handle HTTP/2 headers. This would allow
an attacker to write arbitrary bytes around a certain location on the
heap, resulting in denial-of-service or potential arbitrary code
execution.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.19-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.

For the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-16cd111544
2020-04-11 21:50:51.070260
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : haproxy
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.8.25
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://www.haproxy.org/>
Summary : HAProxy reverse proxy for high availability environments
Description :
HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy which is particularly suited for high
availability environments. Indeed, it can:
- route HTTP requests depending on statically assigned cookies
- spread load among several servers while assuring server persistence
through the use of HTTP cookies
- switch to backup servers in the event a main one fails
- accept connections to special ports dedicated to service monitoring
- stop accepting connections without breaking existing ones
- add, modify, and delete HTTP headers in both directions
- block requests matching particular patterns
- report detailed status to authenticated users from a URI
intercepted from the application

**HAProxyConf 2025 Call for Papers** The next edition of the HAProxyConf will be held on June 4-5 2025, with some workshops on June 3. The [Call for Papers is open](https://www.haproxyconf.com/call-for-papers/). If you feel like you're doing awesome things with HAProxy, that it eases your job, reduces your costs, if you think you've figured smart ways to use it and want to share your findings, if you've written useful companion tools that your friends constantly tell you you should advertise more, and even if you want to express some criticism, please consider submitting a paper to the link above. If you just want to attend, see where it's held, how to get there or register, you can also [visit the conference's site](https://www.haproxyconf.com/) (registrations are expected to open very soon).  **May, 29th, 2024** : **HAProxy 3.0.0 release** Once again, 3.0 has been a release focusing on polishing a lot of the existing things and sprinkling lots of small new features all around, including crt-stores to ease cert management, GUIDs to config objects for more reliable state manipulation, stats preservation across reloads, syslog load balancing, JSON & CBOR logging, virtual maps/acls, improved performance all over the board (Lua, stick-tables, rings), improved H2/H3 protection against protocol-level attacks. A lot more details are explained on the [HAProxyTech's blog](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/announcing-haproxy-3-0), and the [mailing-list announcement](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/msg44993.html) summarizes most of these at a higher level.  **Dec, 5th, 2023** : **HAProxy 2.9.0 release** This release has received a lot of small changes that are difficult to summarize. Most of them were aimed at improving performance and resource usage in general (zero-copy forwarding, QUIC's smaller footprint for closed connections, improved scalability), others focusing on better integration with other components (support for the AWS-LC crypto library, QUIC OpenSSL compatitility layer, PROXY protocol manipulation), ease of configuration (most log-format tags now have an equivalent sample fetch, some converters support variables in addition to integers, warnings about bad cpu-map or thread settings), more reliability (log backends with checked servers, better debugging), and a really cool new feature to play with, reverse-http. A lot more details are explained on the [HAProxyTech's blog](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/announcing-haproxy-2-9), and the [mailing-list announcement](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/msg43600.html) summarizes most of these at a higher level.  [***Older news...***](/news.html) Description HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable reverse-proxy offering [high availability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability), [load balancing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancer), and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for very high traffic web sites and powers a significant portion of the world's most visited ones. Over the years it has become the de-facto standard opensource load balancer, is now shipped with most mainstream Linux distributions, and is often deployed by default in cloud platforms. Since it does not advertise itself, we only know it's used when the [admins report it](/they-use-it.html) :-) The HAProxy core team maintains multiple versions in parallel. Since version 1.8, two major version are emitted every year. The first digit usually indicates a breaking change (config format etc) but in practice rarely changes. The second digit indicates new features. Both constitute a **branch**. One extra number appears after these digits to indicate the bug fix release. The core team deploys a lot of efforts backporting fixes to older releases while being extremely careful not to break anything. For this reason, it is really important to stay up to date within one branch, i.e. having the highest possible number on the last digits. Branches with an even number are called "LTS" (for "long term support") and area maintained for 5 years after their release. During this time they will receive fixes for bugs that are discovered after the release. These branches are aimed at general users who seek extreme stability and do not want to qualify a new version too often but still want to receive fixes. Branches with an odd number are only called "stable", they're aimed at highly skilled users who prefer to upgrade often to benefit from modern features, and who are also able to roll back in case of problem. These versions are maintained between 12 and 18 months. The duration is short and purposely not strict so that the maintenance cycle is decided with users based on feedback, and so that these versions do not end up in embedded products. It may happen that a few features are backported to these version if there is some reasonable demand and the operation is considered riskless enough. Everyone used to dealing with production knows that it's difficult to upgrade components in field when one has to plan and advertise upwards of any operation. For this reason, the HAProxy core team doesn't insist on users to upgrade, will not ask someone to switch to a new branch (unless they ask for a feature that is part of that other branch), but will often ask the user to re-check with the latest version of their branch before reporting a problem, because nobody likes to troubleshoot a problem a second time. It's often suggested to use the versions that come with the operating system when it follows the official maintenance cycle, and depending on the expected level of stability or exposure, some users may want to update as soon as an update is available while others may prefer to wait a few weeks to a month to be sure the update is reliable enough for them. Here's a very rough history of changes in each major version:  * **version 3.0** : crt-stores, persistent stats, syslog load balancing, JSON&CBOR log encoding, virtual maps &acls, zero-copy from the cache, H2/H3 protocol-level protections* **version 2.9** : reverse-http, log backends, zero-copy forwarding, memory usage reduction, increased bandwidth, better general scalability, AWS-LC support, QUIC openssl compat layer, PROXY protocol manipulation* **version 2.8** : QUIC now prod ready, Lua-based mailers, OCSP auto updates, LetsEncrypt, wolfSSL support, RFC7239 "forwarded", listeners on more than 64 threads, perf/usability/reliability/observability improvements* **version 2.7** : Traffic shaping, QUIC improvements, thread groups, easier switch to alternate SSL libraries, improved debugging* **version 2.6** : QUIC/HTTP3, OpenSSL 3.0, better usability, improved code accessibility and maintenance  Hide/Show older ones ...* **version 2.5** : runtime server addition/removal, runtime CA/CRL updates, native HTTP client, simplified HTTPS logging, default TCP/HTTP rulesets, JWT validation, and more* **version 2.4** : syslog and DNS over TCP, multi-threaded Lua, full sharing of idle conns, lower latency, server-side dynamic SSL update, Opentracing, WebSocket over H2, atomic maps, Vary support, new debugging tools, even more user-friendly CLI and configuration, lots of cleanups* **version 2.3** : syslog forwarding, better idle conn management, improved balancing with large queues, simplified SSL managment, more stats metrics, stricter config checking by default, general performance improvements* **version 2.2** : runtime certificate additions, improved idle connection management, logging over TCP, HTTP "return" directive, errorfile templates, TLSv1.2 by default, extensible health-checks* **version 2.1** : improved I/Os and multi-threading, FastCGI, runtime certificate updates, HTX-only, improved debugging, removal of obsolete keywords* **version 2.0** : gRPC, layer 7 retries, process manager, SSL peers, log load balancing/sampling, end-to-end TCP fast-open, automatic settings (maxconn, threads, HTTP reuse, pools), ...* **version 1.9** : improved multi-threading, end-to-end HTTP/2, connection pools, queue priority control, stdout logging, ...* **version 1.8** : multi-threading, HTTP/2, cache, on-the fly server addition/removal, seamless reloads, DNS SRV, hardware SSL engines, ...* **version 1.7** : added server hot reconfiguration, content processing agents, multi-type certs, ...* **version 1.6** : added DNS resolution support, HTTP connection multiplexing, full stick-table replication, stateless compression, ...* **version 1.5** : added SSL, IPv6, server-side keep-alive, DDoS protection, ...* **version 1.4** : client-side keep-alive, stick to any expression, more complete CLI* **version 1.3** : ACL & content switching (frontend/backend split), CLI, TCP splicing, dynamic LB algos* **version 1.2** : epoll, queuing, more LB algorithms* **version 1.1** : health checks, cookie insertion* **version 1.0** : high availability, cookie-based stickiness   Performance  As shown in [this test run on AWS ARM-based Graviton2](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-forwards-over-2-million-http-requests-per-second-on-a-single-aws-arm-instance/), HAProxy scales very well with threads and was shown to be able to reach 2 million requests/s over SSL and 100 Gbps for forwarded traffic.  This is made possible thanks to its [**event-driven**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_driven) architecture that allows to react extremely quickly to I/O events, its parallelism on SMP machines provided by light multi-threading, a task scheduler that permanently composes between low-latency and high throughput, and generally speaking a permanent quest of resource savings at every single architecture layer. These efforts tend to cost a bit in development time but are immediately valued by users who are able to reduce their number of machines upgrade after upgrade. For the vast majority of common loads, the HAProxy process is simply not noticed, which tends to make its users forget it, sometimes resulting in questions regarding extremely old versions.  Please consult [this section](/oldstuff.html#perf) for more information on the architecture details and some performance test results.  Reliability - *keeping high-traffic sites online since 2002* HAProxy is first known for being extremely robust. The core team developers tend to be irritated by certain bugs they fix, but this is because their job is to see them all. Most users report having never ever faced any single crash and claim that HAProxy is the most solid part of their infrastructure. Finding machines with HAProxy processes being up for more than 3 years is not exceptional at all! All this is not an accident, though. A lot of efforts are made in that direction, to provide excellent observability on what is happening, and an amazing number of protections against bad behaviors. HAProxy is built with many checks for unacceptable situations (impossible conditions, endless loops, etc) that in other products might result in service outages or data corruption, but in HAProxy will immediately result in a crash with a dump of the problem. This rigor pays off since most users have never faced such an issue, thanks to the few who faced them and provided useful reports allowing to fix the problem early. The development process also encourages quality, with a long term maintenance cycle: versions are maintained for 5 years by the same developers who code the new features. This encourages them to write high quality code and commit messages that correspond to the highest standards. A regression testing suite is used and run along development by all developers and before merging code, as well as after on a wide variety of platforms thanks to the continuous integration (CI) system. The principle of "eating one's dog's food" applies here as well: haproxy.org runs on the latest development release. This usually helps spot a bug or two per major version before it hits a release. But in addition it maintains a permanent pressure on the development team to release something they're confident in. The program having been designed from its early age to be extremely conservative on resource usage, a significant number of settings are calculated at startup time and enforce many limits on number of sockets, connections, streams etc, guaranteeing that any processing that was started will complete. Security - *Hardened by default* Security is a very important concern when deploying a software load balancer, because it runs at the edge and takes all the dirty traffic. It is possible to harden the OS, to limit the number of open ports and accessible services, but the load balancer itself stays exposed. The unified and non-fantasist [coding style](/coding-style.html) aims at avoiding common traps when writing or reviewing code. Some high standards are sought when it comes to dealing with unvalidated data. Non-portable functions and those having unreliable behaviors are avoided or replaced. Input data gets sanitized very early in the lower layers. Resource usage is carefully controlled. Dangling pointers are forbidden in the code via careful release functions. These standards already help eliminate a great deal of uncertainty in the code itself. Since zero-bug is not reasonable, the product embarks a number of defensive measures, such as chroot, privilege drops, fork prevention, strict protocol validation, checks for impossible states and detailed traces in case of violation detection, etc. All these usually result in an attempt to exploit a real bug in a failure or possibly a crash. These measures have to be purposely disabled by the user using sufficiently evocative commands so that the reason for doing so has to be regularly questioned.

The [HTML versions](http://docs.haproxy.org/) are direct translations from the text version automatically performed by Cyril Bonté's excellent documentation converter, [dconv](https://github.com/cbonte/haproxy-dconv/). A [TeX-oriented](https://github.com/langpavel/haproxy-doc) variant able to produce PDFs was also created by Pavel Lang for versions 1.4 and 1.5 but it is not maintained anymore. Commercial Support and availability If you think you don't have the time and skills to setup and maintain a free load balancer, or if you're seeking for commercial support to satisfy your customers or your boss, you have the following options :  1. contact [HAProxy Technologies](https://www.haproxy.com/services/haproxy-professional-services/)    to hire some professional services or subscribe a support contract ;- install [HAProxy Enterprise Edition (HAPEE)](https://www.haproxy.com/products/haproxy-enterprise-edition/),      which is a long-term maintained HAProxy package accompanied by a well-polished collection of software, scripts,      configuration files and documentation which significantly simplifies the setup and maintenance of a completely      operational solution ; it is particularly suited to **Cloud environments** where deployments must be fast.- try an [ALOHA appliance](https://www.haproxy.com/products/main-features-of-aloha-load-balancers/)        (hardware or virtual), which will even save you from having to worry about the system, hardware and from managing a Unix-like        system.  I also find it important to credit [**Loadbalancer.org**](http://www.loadbalancer.org/). I am not affiliated with them at all but like us, they have contributed a fair amount of time and money to the project to add new features and they help users on the mailing list, so I have some respect for what they do. They're a UK-based company and their load balancer also employs HAProxy, though it is somewhat different from the ALOHA. Contacts Feel free to contact us for any questions or comments :  * mailing-list :       Read the list [archives on mail-archive](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/)   Some people regularly ask if it is possible to send donations, so I have set up a Paypal account for this. **[Click here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=w%401wt%2eeu&lc=FR&item_name=Willy%20Tarreau¤cy_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted)** if you want to donate.

[Willy Tarreau](/search?l=haproxy@formilux.org&q=from:%22Willy+Tarreau%22)

```
Hi,

HAProxy 2.1.4 was released on 2020/04/02. It added 99 new commits
after version 2.1.3.
```
```

The main driver for this release is that it contains a fix for a serious
vulnerability that was responsibly reported last week by Felix Wilhelm
from Google Project Zero, affecting the HPACK decoder used for HTTP/2.
CVE-2020-11100 was assigned to this issue.

There is no configuration-based workaround for 2.1 and above.

This vulnerability makes it possible under certain circumstances to write
to a wide range of memory locations within the process' heap, with the
limitation that the attacker doesn't control the absolute address, so the
most likely result and by a far margin will be a process crash, but it is
not possible to completely rule out the faint possibility of a remote code
execution, at least in a lab-controlled environment. Felix was kind enough
to agree to delay the publication of his findings to the 20th of this month
in order to leave enough time to haproxy users to apply updates. But please
do not wait, as it is not very difficult to figure how to exploit the bug
based on the fix. Distros were notified and will also have fixes available
very shortly.

Three other important fixes are present in this version:
  - a non-portable way of calculating a list pointer that breaks with
    gcc 10 unless using -fno-tree-pta. This bug results in infinite loops
    at random places in the code depending how the compiler decides to
    optimize the code.

  - a bug in the way TLV fields are extracted from the PROXY protocol, as
    they could be mistakenly looked up in the subsequent payload, even
    though these would have limited effects since these ones would generally
    be meaningless for the transported protocol, but could be used to hide a
    source address from logging for example.

  - the "tarpit" rules were partially broken in that since 1.9 they wouldn't
    prevent a connection from being sent to a server while the 500 response
    is delivered to the client. Given that they are often used to block
    suspicious activity it's problematic.

The rest is less important, but still relevant to some users. Among those
noticeable I can enumerate:
  - the O(N^2) ACL unique-id allocator that could take several minutes to
    boot on certain very large configs was reworked to follow O(NlogN)
    instead.

  - the default global maxconn setting when not set in the configuration was
    incorrectly set to the process' soft limit instead of the hard limit,
    resulting in much lower connection counts on some setups after upgrade
    from 1.x to 2.x. It now properly follows the hard limit.

  - a new thread-safe random number generator that will avoid the risk that
    the "uuid" sample fetch function returns the exact same UUID in several
    threads.

  - issues in HTX mode affecting filters, namely cache and compression, that
    could lead to data corruption.

  - alignment issues causing bus error on Sparc64 were addressed

  - fixed a rare case of possible segfault on soft-stop when a finishing thread
    flushes its pools while another one is freeing some elements.

Please have a look at the changelog below for a more detailed list of fixes,
and do not forget to update, either from the sources or from your regular

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# HAProxy: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **202012-22**

A buffer overflow in HAProxy might allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/haproxy** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.13**>= **2.1.4** |

### Background

HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy for high availability environments.

### Description

It was discovered that HAProxy incorrectly handled certain HTTP/2
headers.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 request, could
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, or
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

Disable HTTP/2 support.

### Resolution

All HAProxy 2.0.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/haproxy-2.0.13:0/2.0"

```

All other HAProxy users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/haproxy-2.1.4"

```

| [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c13)  Robert Frohl   2020-04-02 13:15:23 UTC  ``` HAProxy was released on 2020/04/02.  The main driver for this release is that it contains a fix for a serious vulnerability that was responsibly reported last week by Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero, affecting the HPACK decoder used for HTTP/2. CVE-2020-11100 was assigned to this issue.  There is no configuration-based workaround for 2.1 and above.  This vulnerability makes it possible under certain circumstances to write to a wide range of memory locations within the process' heap, with the limitation that the attacker doesn't control the absolute address, so the most likely result and by a far margin will be a process crash, but it is not possible to completely rule out the faint possibility of a remote code execution, at least in a lab-controlled environment. Felix was kind enough to agree to delay the publication of his findings to the 20th of this month in order to leave enough time to haproxy users to apply updates. But please do not wait, as it is not very difficult to figure how to exploit the bug based on the fix. Distros were notified and will also have fixes available very shortly. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c14)  Robert Frohl   2020-04-02 13:15:43 UTC  ``` public via mailinglist ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-02 14:20:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1168023) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/790908> Factory / haproxy <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/790909> 15.2 / haproxy ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1168023#c16)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-02 16:20:42 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:0851-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

- now, haproxy warns about missing timeout during startup to try to
eliminate all those buggy configurations.
- added "Content-Type: text/html" in responses wherever appropriate, as
suggested by Cameron Simpson.
- implemented "option ssl-hello-chk" to use SSLv3 CLIENT HELLO messages to
test server's health
- implemented "monitor-uri" so that haproxy can reply to a specific URI with
an "HTTP/1.0 200 OK" response. This is useful to validate multiple proxies
at once.
2006/06/29 : 1.3.0
- exploded the whole file into multiple .c and .h. No functionnal
difference is expected at all.
- fixed a bug by which neither stats nor error messages could be returned if
'clitimeout' was missing.
2006/05/21 : 1.2.14
- new HTML status report with the 'stats' keyword.
- added the 'abortonclose' option to better resist traffic surges
- implemented dynamic traffic regulation with the 'minconn' option
- show request time on denied requests
- definitely fixed hot reconf on OpenBSD by the use of SO\_REUSEPORT
- now a proxy instance is allowed to run without servers, which is
useful to dedicate one instance to stats
- added lots of error counters
- a missing parenthesis preventd matching of cacheable cookies
- a missing parenthesis in poll\_loop() might have caused missed events.
2006/05/14 : 1.2.13.1
- an uninitialized field in the struct session could cause a crash when
the session was freed. This has been encountered on Solaris only.
- Solaris and OpenBSD no not support shutdown() on listening socket. Let's
be nice to them by performing a soft stop if pause fails.
2006/05/13 : 1.2.13
- 'maxconn' server parameter to do per-server session limitation
- queueing to support non-blocking session limitation
- fixed removal of cookies for cookie-less servers such as backup servers
- two separate wait queues for expirable and non-expirable tasks provide
better performance with lots of sessions.
- some code cleanups and performance improvements
- made state dumps a bit more verbose
- fixed missing checks for NULL srv in dispatch mode
- load balancing on backup servers was not possible in source hash mode.
- two session flags shared the same bit, but fortunately they were not
compatible.
2006/04/15 : 1.2.12
Very few changes preparing for more important changes to support per-server
session limitations and queueing :
- ignore leading empty lines in HTTP requests as suggested by RFC2616.
- added the 'weight' parameter to the servers, limited to 1..256. It applies
to roundrobin and source hash.
- the optional '-s' option could clobber '-st' and '-sf' if compiled in.
2006/03/30 : 1.2.11.1
- under some conditions, it might have been possible that when the
last dead server became available, it would not have been used
till another one would have changed state. Could not be reproduced
at all, however seems possible from the code.
2006/03/25 : 1.2.11
- added the '-db' command-line option to disable backgrounding.
- added the -sf/-st command-line arguments which are used to specify
a list of pids to send a FINISH or TERMINATE signal upon startup.
They will also be asked to release their port if a bind fails.
- reworked the startup mechanism to allow the sending of a signal to a list
of old pids if a socket cannot be bound, with a retry for a limited amount
of time (1 second by default).
- added the ability to enforce limits on memory usage.
- added the 'source' load-balancing algorithm which uses the source IP(v4|v6)
- re-architectured the server round-robin mechanism to ease integration of
other algorithms. It now relies on the number of active and backup servers.
- added a counter for the number of active and backup servers, and report
these numbers upon SIGHUP or state change.
2006/03/23 : 1.2.10.1
- while fixing the backup server round-robin "feature", a new bug was
introduced which could miss some backup servers.
- the displayed proxy name was wrong when dumping upon SIGHUP.
2006/03/19 : 1.2.10
- assert.h is needed when DEBUG is defined.
- ENORMOUS long standing bug affecting the epoll polling system :
event\_data is a union, not a structure !
- Make fd management more robust and easier to debug. Also some
micro-optimisations.
- Limit the number of consecutive accept() in multi-process mode.
This produces a more evenly distributed load across the processes and
slightly improves performance by reducing bottlenecks.
- Make health-checks be more regular, and faster to retry after a timeout.
- Fixed some messages to ease parsing of alerts.
- provided a patch to enable epoll on RHEL3 kernels.
- Separated OpenBSD build from the main Makefile into a new one.
2006/03/15 : 1.2.9
- haproxy could not be stopped after being paused, it had to be woken up
first. This has been fixed.
- the 'ulimit-n' parameter is now optional and by default computed from
maxconn + the number of listeners + the number of health-checks.
- it is now possible to specify a maximum number of connections at build
time with the SYSTEM\_MAXCONN define. The value set in the configuration
file will then be limited to this value, and only the command-line '-n'
option will be able to bypass it. It will prevent against accidental
high memory usage on small systems.
- RFC2616 expects that any HTTP agent accepts multi-line headers. Earlier
versions did not detect a line beginning with a space as the continuation
of previous header. It is now correct.
- health checks sent to servers configured with identical intervals were
sent in perfect synchronisation because the initial time was the same
for all. This could induce high load peaks when fragile servers were
hosting tens of instances for the same application. Now the load is
spread evenly across the smallest interval amongst a listener.
- a new 'forceclose' option was added to make the proxy close the outgoing
channel to the server once it has sent all its headers and the server
starts responding. This helps some servers which don't close upon the
'Connection: close' header. It implies 'option httpclose'.
- there was a bug in the way the backup servers were handled. They were
erroneously load-balanced while the doc said the opposite. Since
load-balanced backup servers is one of the features some people have
been asking for, the problem was fixed to reflect the documented
behaviour and a new option 'allbackups' was introduced to provide the
feature to those who need it.
- a never ending connect() could lead to a fast select() loop if its
timeout times the number of retransmits exceeded the server read or write
timeout, because the later was used to compute select()'s timeout while
the connection timeout was not reached.
- now we initialize the libc's localtime structures very early so that even
under OOM conditions, we can still send dated error messages without
segfaulting.
- the 'daemon' mode implies 'quiet' and disables 'verbose' because file
descriptors are closed.
2006/01/29 : 1.2.8
- fixed a nasty bug affecting poll/epoll which could return unmodified data
from the server to the client, and sometimes lead to memory corruption
crashing the process.
- added the new pause/play mechanism with SIGTTOU/SIGTTIN for hot-reconf.
2005/12/18 : 1.2.7.1
- the "retries" option was ignored because connect() could not return an
error if the connection failed before the timeout.
- TCP health-checks could not detect a connection refused in poll/epoll
mode.
2005/11/13 : 1.2.7
- building with -DUSE\_PCRE should include PCRE headers and not regex.h. At
least on Solaris, this caused the libc's regex primitives to be used instead
of PCRE, which caused trouble on group references. This is now fixed.
- delayed the quiet mode during startup so that most of the startup alerts can
be displayed even in quiet mode.
- display an alert when a listener has no address, invalid or no port, or when
there are no enabled listeners upon startup.
- added "static-pcre" to the list of supported regex options in the Makefile.
2005/10/09 : 1.2.7rc (1.1.33rc)
- second batch of socklen\_t changes.
- clean-ups from Cameron Simpson.
- because tv\_remain() does not know about eternity, using no timeout can
make select() spin around a null time-out. Bug reported by Cameron Simpson.
- client read timeout was not properly set to eternity initialized after an
accept() if it was not set in the config. It remained undetected so long
because eternity is 0 and newly allocated pages are zeroed by the system.
- do not call get\_original\_dst() when not in transparent mode.
- implemented a workaround for a bug in certain epoll() implementations on
linux-2.4 kernels (epoll-lt <= 0.21).
- implemented TCP keepalive with new options : tcpka, clitcpka, srvtcpka.
2005/08/07 : 1.2.6
- clean-up patch from Alexander Lazic fixes build on Debian 3.1 (socklen\_t).
2005/07/06 : 1.2.6-pre5 (1.1.32)
- added the number of active sessions (proxy/process) in the logs
2005/07/06 : 1.2.6-pre4 (1.1.32-pre4)
- the time-out fix introduced in 1.1.25 caused a corner case where it was
possible for a client to keep a connection maintained regardless of the
timeout if the server closed the connection during the HEADER phase,
while the client ignored the close request while doing nothing in the
other direction. This has been fixed now by ensuring that read timeouts
are re-armed when switching to any SHUTW state.
2005/07/05 : 1.2.6-pre3 (1.1.32-pre3)
- enhanced error reporting in the logs. Now the proxy will precisely detect
various error conditions related to the system and/or process limits, and
generate LOG\_EMERG logs indicating that a resource has been exhausted.
- logs will contain two new characters for the error cause : 'R' indicates
a resource exhausted, and 'I' indicates an internal error, though this
one should never happen.
- server connection timeouts can now be reported in the logs (sC), as well
as connections refused because of maxconn limitations (PC).
2005/07/05 : 1.2.6-pre2 (1.1.32-pre2)
- new global configuration keyword "ulimit-n" may be used to raise the FD
limit to usable values.
- a warning is now displayed on startup if the FD limit is lower than the
configured maximum number of sockets.
2005/07/05 : 1.2.6-pre1 (1.1.32-pre1)
- new configuration keyword "monitor-net" makes it possible to be monitored
by external devices which connect to the proxy without being logged nor
forwarded to any server. Particularly useful on generic TCPv4 relays.
2005/06/21 : 1.2.5.2
- fixed build on PPC where chars are unsigned by default
2005/05/02 : 1.2.5.1
- dirty hack to fix a bug introduced with epoll : if we close an FD and
immediately reassign it to another session through a connect(), the
Prev{Read,Write}Events are not updated, which causes trouble detecting
changes, thus leading to many timeouts at high loads.
2005/04/30 : 1.2.5 (1.1.31)
- changed the runtime argument to disable epoll() to '-de'
- changed the runtime argument to disable poll() to '-dp'
- added global options 'nopoll' and 'noepoll' to do the same at the
configuration level.
- added a 'linux24e' target to the Makefile for Linux 2.4 systems patched to
support epoll().
- changed default FD\_SETSIZE to 65536 on Solaris (default=1024)
- conditionned signals redirection to #ifdef DEBUG\_MEMORY
2005/04/26 : 1.2.5-pre4
- made epoll() support a compile-time option : ENABLE\_EPOLL
- provided a very little libc replacement for a possibly missing epoll()
implementation which can be enabled by -DUSE\_MY\_EPOLL
- implemented the poll() poller, which can be enabled with -DENABLE\_POLL.
The equivalent runtime argument becomes '-P'. A few tests show that it
performs like select() with many fds, but slightly slower (certainly
because of the higher amount of memory involved).
- separated the 3 polling methods and the tasks scheduler into 4 distinct
functions which makes the code a lot more modular.
- moved some event tables to private static declarations inside the poller
functions.
- the poller functions can now initialize themselves, run, and cleanup.
- changed the runtime argument to enable epoll() to '-E'.
- removed buggy epoll\_ctl() code in the client\_retnclose() function. This
function was never meant to remove anything.
- fixed a typo which caused glibc to yell about a double free on exit.
- removed error checking after epoll\_ctl(DEL) because we can never know if
the fd is still active or already closed.
- added a few entries in the makefile
2005/04/25 : 1.2.5-pre3
- experimental epoll() support (use temporary '-e' argument)
2005/04/24 : 1.2.5-pre2
- implemented the HTTP 303 code for error redirection. This forces the
browser to fetch the given URI with a GET request. The new keyword for
this is 'errorloc303', and a new 'errorloc302' keyword has been created
to make them easily distinguishable.
- added more controls in the parser for valid use of '\x' sequence.
- few fixes from Alex & Klaus
2005/02/17 : 1.2.5-pre1
- fixed a few errors in the documentation
2005/02/13
- do not pre-initialize unused file-descriptors before select() anymore.
2005/01/22 : 1.2.4
- merged Alexander Lazic's and Klaus Wagner's work on application
cookie-based persistence. Since this is the first merge, this version is
not intended for general use and reports are more than welcome. Some
documentation is really needed though.
2005/01/22 : 1.2.3 (1.1.30)
- add an architecture guide to the documentation
- released without any changes
2004/12/26 : 1.2.3-pre1 (1.1.30-pre1)
- increased default BUFSIZE to 16 kB to accept max headers of 8 kB which is
compatible with Apache. This limit can be configured in the makefile now.
Thanks to Eric Fehr for the checks.
- added a per-server "source" option which now makes it possible to bind to
a different source for each (potentially identical) server.
- changed cookie-based server selection slightly to allow several servers to
share a same cookie, thus making it possible to associate backup servers to
live servers and ease soft-stop for maintenance periods. (Alexander Lazic)
- added the cookie 'prefix' mode which makes it possible to use persistence
with thin clients which support only one cookie. The server name is prefixed
before the application cookie, and restore back.
- fixed the order of servers within an instance to match documentation. Now
the servers are \*really\* used in the order of their declaration. This is
particularly important when multiple backup servers are in use.
2004/10/18 : 1.2.2 (1.1.29)
- fixed a bug where a TCP connection would be logged twice if the 'logasap'
option was enabled without the 'tcplog' option.
- encode\_string() would use hdr\_encode\_map instead of the map argument.
2004/08/10 : (1.1.29-pre2)
- the logged request is now encoded with '#XX' for unprintable characters
- new keywords 'capture request header' and 'capture response header' enable
logging of arbitrary HTTP headers in requests and responses
- removed "-DSOLARIS" after replacing the last inet\_aton() with inet\_pton()
2004/06/06 : 1.2.1 (1.1.28)
- added the '-V' command line option to verbosely report errors even though
the -q or 'quiet' options are specified. This is useful with '-c'.
- added a Red Hat init script and a .spec from Simon Matter
2004/06/05 :
- added the "logasap" option which produces a log without waiting for the data
to be transferred from the server to the client.
- added the "httpclose" option which removes any "connection:" header and adds
"Connection: close" in both direction.
- added the 'checkcache' option which blocks cacheable responses containing
dangerous headers, such as 'set-cookie'.
- added 'rspdeny' and 'rspideny' to block certain responses to avoid sensible
information leak from servers.
2004/04/18 :
- send an EMERG log when no server is available for a given proxy
- added the '-c' command line option to syntactically check the
configuration file without starting the service.
2003/11/09 : 1.2.0
- the same as 1.1.27 + IPv6 support on the client side
2003/10/27 : 1.1.27
- the configurable HTTP health check introduced in 1.1.23 revealed a shameful
bug : the code still assumed that HTTP requests were the same size as the
original ones (22 bytes), and failed if they were not.
- added support for pidfiles.
2003/10/22 : 1.1.26
- the fix introduced in 1.1.25 for client timeouts while waiting for servers
broke almost all compatibility with POST requests, because the proxy
stopped to read anything from the client as soon as it got all of its
headers.
2003/10/15 : 1.1.25
- added the 'tcplog' option, which provides enhanced, HTTP-like logs for
generic TCP proxies, or lighter logs for HTTP proxies.
- fixed a time-out condition wrongly reported as client time-out in data
phase if the client timeout was lower than the connect timeout times the
number of retries.
2003/09/21 : 1.1.24
- if a client sent a full request then shut its write connection down, then
the request was aborted. This case was detected only when using haproxy
both as health-check client and as a server.
- if 'option httpchk' is used in a 'health' mode server, then responses will
change from 'OK' to 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK'.
- fixed a Linux-only bug in case of HTTP server health-checks, where a single
server response followed by a close could be ignored, and the server seen
as failed.
2003/09/19 : 1.1.23
- fixed a stupid bug introduced in 1.1.22 which caused second and subsequent
'default' sections to keep previous parameters, and not initialize logs
correctly.
- fixed a second stupid bug introduced in 1.1.22 which caused configurations
relying on 'dispatch' mode to segfault at the first connection.
- 'option httpchk' now supports method, HTTP version and a few headers.
- now, 'option httpchk', 'cookie' and 'capture' can be specified in
'defaults' section
2003/09/10 : 1.1.22
- 'listen' now supports optionnal address:port-range lists
- 'bind' introduced to add new listen addresses
- fixed a bug which caused a session to be kept established on a server till
it timed out if the client closed during the DATA phase.
- the port part of each server address can now be empty to make the proxy
connect to the server on the same port it was connected to, be an absolute
unsigned number to reflect a single port (as in older versions), or an
explicitly signed number (+N/-N) to indicate that this offset must be
applied to the port the proxy was connected to, when connecting to the
server.
- the 'port' server option allows the user to specify a different
health-check port than the service one. It is mandatory when only relative
ports have been specified and check is required. By default, the checks are
sent to the service port.
- new 'defaults' section which is rather similar to 'listen' except that all
values are only used as default values for future 'listen' sections, until
a new 'defaults' resets them. At the moment, server options, regexes,
cookie names and captures cannot be set in the 'defaults' section.
2003/05/06 : 1.1.21
- changed the debug output format so that it now includes the session unique
ID followed by the instance name at the beginning of each line.
- in debug mode, accept now shows the client's IP and port.
- added one 3 small debugging scripts to search and pretty print debug output
- changed the default health check request to "OPTIONS /" instead of
"OPTIONS \*" since not all servers implement the later one.
- "option httpchk" now accepts an optional parameter allowing the user to
specify and URI other than '/' during health-checks.
2003/04/21 : 1.1.20
- fixed two problems with time-outs, one where a server would be logged as
timed out during transfer that take longer to complete than the fixed
time-out, and one where clients were logged as timed-out during the data
phase because they didn't have anything to send. This sometimes caused
slow client connections to close too early while in fact there was no
problem. The proper fix would be to have a per-fd time-out with
conditions depending on the state of the HTTP FSM.
2003/04/16 : 1.1.19
- haproxy was NOT RFC compliant because it was case-sensitive on HTTP
"Cookie:" and "Set-Cookie:" headers. This caused JVM 1.4 to fail on
cookie persistence because it uses "cookie:". Two memcmp() have been
replaced with strncasecmp().
2003/04/02 : 1.1.18
- Haproxy can be compiled with PCRE regex instead of libc regex, by setting
REGEX=pcre on the make command line.
- HTTP health-checks now use "OPTIONS \*" instead of "OPTIONS /".
- when explicit source address binding is required, it is now also used for
health-checks.
- added 'reqpass' and 'reqipass' to allow certain headers but not the request
itself.
- factored several strings to reduce binary size by about 2 kB.
- replaced setreuid() and setregid() with more standard setuid() and setgid().
- added 4 status flags to the log line indicating who ended the connection
first, the sessions state, the validity of the cookie, and action taken on
the set-cookie header.
2002/10/18 : 1.1.17
- add the notion of "backup" servers, which are used only when all other
servers are down.
- make Set-Cookie return "" instead of "(null)" when the server has no
cookie assigned (useful for backup servers).
- "log" now supports an optionnal level name (info, notice, err ...) above
which nothing is sent.
- replaced some strncmp() with memcmp() for better efficiency.
- added "capture cookie" option which logs client and/or server cookies
- cleaned up/down messages and dump servers states upon SIGHUP
- added a redirection feature for errors : "errorloc  "
- now we won't insist on connecting to a dead server, even with a cookie,
unless option "persist" is specified.
- added HTTP/408 response for client request time-out and HTTP/50[234] for
server reply time-out or errors.
2002/09/01 : 1.1.16
- implement HTTP health checks when option "httpchk" is specified.
2002/08/07 : 1.1.15
- replaced setpgid()/setpgrp() with setsid() for better portability, because
setpgrp() doesn't have the same meaning under Solaris, Linux, and OpenBSD.
2002/07/20 : 1.1.14
- added "postonly" cookie mode
2002/07/15 : 1.1.13
- tv\_diff used inverted parameters which led to negative times !
2002/07/13 : 1.1.12
- fixed stats monitoring, and optimized some tv\_\* for most common cases.
- replaced temporary 'newhdr' with 'trash' to reduce stack size
- made HTTP errors more HTML-fiendly.
- renamed strlcpy() to strlcpy2() because of a slightly difference between
their behaviour (return value), to avoid confusion.
- restricted HTTP messages to HTTP proxies only
- added a 502 message when the connection has been refused by the server,
to prevent clients from believing this is a zero-byte HTTP 0.9 reply.
- changed 'Cache-control:' from 'no-cache="set-cookie"' to 'private' when
inserting a cookie, because some caches (apache) don't understand it.
- fixed processing of server headers when client is in SHUTR state
2002/07/04 :
- automatically close fd's 0,1 and 2 when going daemon ; setpgrp() after
setpgid()
2002/06/04 : 1.1.11
- fixed multi-cookie handling in client request to allow clean deletion
in insert+indirect mode. Now, only the server cookie is deleted and not
all the header. Should now be compliant to RFC2965.
- added a "nocache" option to "cookie" to specify that we explicitly want
to add a "cache-control" header when we add a cookie.
It is also possible to add an "Expires: " to keep compatibility
with old/broken caches.
2002/05/10 : 1.1.10
- if a cookie is used in insert+indirect mode, it's desirable that the
the servers don't see it. It was not possible to remove it correctly
with regexps, so now it's removed automatically.
2002/04/19 : 1.1.9
- don't use snprintf()'s return value as an end of message since it may
be larger. This caused bus errors and segfaults in internal libc's
getenv() during localtime() in send\_log().
- removed dead insecure send\_syslog() function and all references to it.
- fixed warnings on Solaris due to buggy implementation of isXXXX().
2002/04/18 : 1.1.8
- option "dontlognull"
- fixed "double space" bug in config parser
- fixed an uninitialized server field in case of dispatch
with no existing server which could cause a segfault during
logging.
- the pid logged was always the father's, which was wrong for daemons.
- fixed wrong level "LOG\_INFO" for message "proxy started".
2002/04/13 :
- http logging is now complete :
- ip:port, date, proxy, server
- req\_time, conn\_time, hdr\_time, tot\_time
- status, size, request
- source address
2002/04/12 : 1.1.7
- added option forwardfor
- added reqirep, reqidel, reqiallow, reqideny, rspirep, rspidel
- added "log global" in "listen" section.
2002/04/09 :
- added a new "global" section :
- logs
- debug, quiet, daemon modes
- uid, gid, chroot, nbproc, maxconn
2002/04/08 : 1.1.6
- regex are now chained and not limited anymore.
- unavailable server now returns HTTP/502.
- increased per-line args limit to 40
- added reqallow/reqdeny to block some request on matches
- added HTTP 400/403 responses
2002/04/03 : 1.1.5
- connection logging displayed incorrect source address.
- added proxy start/stop and server up/down log events.
- replaced log message short buffers with larger trash.
- enlarged buffer to 8 kB and replace buffer to 4 kB.
2002/03/25 : 1.1.4
- made rise/fall/interval time configurable
2002/03/22 : 1.1.3
- fixed a bug : cr\_expire and cw\_expire were inverted in CL\_STSHUT[WR]
which could lead to loops.
2002/03/21 : 1.1.2
- fixed a bug in buffer management where we could have a loop
between event\_read() and process\_{cli|srv} if R==BUFSIZE-MAXREWRITE.
=> implemented an adjustable buffer limit.
- fixed a bug : expiration of tasks in wait queue timeout is used again,
and running tasks are skipped.
- added some debug lines for accept events.
- send warnings for servers up/down.
2002/03/12 : 1.1.1
- fixed a bug in total failure handling
- fixed a bug in timestamp comparison within same second (tv\_cmp\_ms)
2002/03/10 : 1.1.0
- fixed a few timeout bugs
- rearranged the task scheduler subsystem to improve performance,
add new tasks, and make it easier to later port to librt ;
- allow multiple accept() for one select() wake up ;
- implemented internal load balancing with basic health-check ;
- cookie insertion and header add/replace/delete, with better strings
support.
2002/03/08
- reworked buffer handling to fix a few rewrite bugs, and
improve overall performance.
- implement the "purge" option to delete server cookies in direct mode.
2002/03/07
- fixed some error cases where the maxfd was not decreased.
2002/02/26
- now supports transparent proxying, at least on linux 2.4.
2002/02/12
- soft stop works again (fixed select timeout computation).
- it seems that TCP proxies sometimes cannot timeout.
- added a "quiet" mode.
- enforce file descriptor limitation on socket() and accept().
2001/12/30 : release of version 1.0.2 : fixed a bug in header processing
2001/12/19 : release of version 1.0.1 : no MSG\_NOSIGNAL on solaris
2001/12/16 : release of version 1.0.0.
2001/12/16 : added syslog capability for each accepted connection.
