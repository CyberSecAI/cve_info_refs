# [Audio-switcher pulseaudio interface auto connect request](/t/audio-switcher-pulseaudio-interface-auto-connect-request/16648)

I’m honestly not sure if I can. I’m using pulseaudio interface to enable control over host system’s pulseaudio with pactl contained within the snap. If audio-playback and audio-record only do what it says on the tin, I don’t suppose I can.

Also, since my script is entirely pulse-audio specific, I don’t really plan on supporting other sound servers in the short-term.

## Packages

* [pulseaudio](/security/cves?package=pulseaudio) - PulseAudio sound server

## Details

PulseAudio in Ubuntu contains additional functionality to mediate audio

recording for snap packages and it was discovered that this functionality

did not mediate PulseAudio module unloading. An attacker-controlled snap

with only the audio-playback interface connected could exploit this to

bypass access controls and record audio.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

### Bug Description

This collates information about a security vulnerability discussed in email. It has been assigned CVE-2020-11931.

Ubuntu's PulseAudio package is shipped with a custom "module-snap-policy" module intended to restrict snap confined clients from recording audio unless they have the "audio-record" plug connected. However, it does not restrict access to the "PA\_COMMAND\_UNLOAD\_MODULE" command.

This allows a snap that has only plugged "audio-playback" to request that PulseAudio unload the security policy module, which in turn makes it possible to record audio.

Attached is a snapcraft.yaml file that can be used to build an exploit snap. With it built and installed, we can see that recording is initially blocked:

$ record-exploit.parecord /tmp/foo.wav

    Stream error: Access denied

But if we disable the security policy first, we can record:

$ record-exploit.disable-security

    $ record-exploit.parecord /tmp/foo.wav

    ^C

The snap also exposes a "record-exploit.pactl" command to help demonstrate what is possible from within confinement.

Attached is a proposed fix for the vulnerability (at least the focal version). It connects to more hooks to prevent snaps from:

 \* requesting the daemon quit

 \* listing modules

 \* loading modules

 \* unloading modules

 \* kill clients

It also updates some deprecated libsnapd-glib API usage. With this version installed, the "record-exploit.disable-security" command will fail. Other commands that will fail include:

record-exploit.pactl list modules

    record-exploit.pactl load-module whatever

    record-exploit.pactl unload-module 1

    record-exploit.pactl exit

(there is no pactl command to test killing clients).

Thanks James! I've assigned this to myself for sponsoring through the -security pocket and issuing a USN. After the USN is issued, are you planning a groovy update?

FYI, we need a no change rebuild for snapd-glib 1.49 in xenial and bionic based on the changes to debian/control. I'll be doing that as well.

Yep. The non \*-updates versions in those two releases are not sufficient for the snap policy module to function correctly. IIRC, versions before 2.40 or 2.41 did not properly reconnect if snapd restarted while PulseAudio was running.

FYI, after local testing, I uploaded focal debdiff as is and backports for xenial-eoan to the security ppa. Once built, I'll retest and issue the USN.
