Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-11554:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control on the `info.php4` file, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The `info.php4` file exposes sensitive information about the system and its configuration. The content doesn't explicitly state the nature of this info but implies that it is related to the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The content does not provide specific details on the impact of information disclosure itself. However, it is implied that this information could be used to further exploit the system. It is not clear from this content alone what is disclosed and how that information could be leveraged. The document does mention that an XSS and CSRF vulnerability are leveraged for further attacks, along with the disclosure of cleartext credentials in backup files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** An attacker can potentially access the `info.php4` file directly through a web browser if the vulnerable server is accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SNMPc OnLine server. No specific authentication is mentioned as required to access `info.php4`.
