Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of SSL certificate validation in the RSS application of the affected DVB-T2 set-top boxes. Specifically, the application does not verify the authenticity of the SSL certificates presented by the RSS servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing SSL Certificate Validation:** The primary vulnerability is that the RSS application does not validate the SSL certificates of RSS servers. This means it will accept any certificate, including self-signed or malicious ones.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:** The lack of SSL certificate validation enables MitM attacks. An attacker can intercept the communication between the set-top box and the RSS server.
*   **Unencrypted Data Transmission:** The communication between the weather app and AccuWeather servers also uses unencrypted HTTP protocol.
*   **DNS Hijacking:** Due to the lack of certificate validation, attackers can redirect traffic through DNS hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify the content of the RSS feed displayed on the user's TV. This includes displaying fake news or injecting malicious content.
*  **Ransomware:** An attacker could display a ransomware message to the user, claiming the TV has been hijacked and demanding payment to release it.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Although not the primary impact, the ability to modify content could be a step towards distributing malware, if an attacker found a way to execute code through the feed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker intercepts the traffic between the set-top box and the RSS server, modifying the content in transit. This can be achieved by controlling a router in the network.
*   **DNS Hijacking:** An attacker redirects the set-top box's DNS queries for the RSS server to a malicious server they control.
*  **On-box DNS Manipulation:** An attacker with root access can modify the DNS settings of the set-top box directly, allowing for persistent DNS hijacking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable DVB-T2 set-top box or have the capability to perform MitM on the network (e.g., by controlling the network router).
*  **Control of a Router or DNS Server:** To perform MitM or DNS hijacking, the attacker needs to control a router on the network or be able to set up a rogue DNS server on the local network.
*   **Basic Network Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of network protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) to intercept and modify traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The article mentions that the set-top boxes use a very old Linux kernel (3.10.23) which is no longer supported, leading to further vulnerabilities and no available updates.
*  The devices have a hardcoded telnet service enabled by default, which provides root access on the local network (covered in CVE-2020-11618).
*   The article provides steps to inject malware using the telnet vulnerability, and explains how the persistent storage vulnerabilities of the devices allow for malware to survive reboots and factory resets.
