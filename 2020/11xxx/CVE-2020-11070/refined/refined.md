Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11070:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The SVG sanitizer fails to properly process and sanitize slightly invalid or incomplete SVG markup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Sanitization:** The core issue is that the sanitizer does not correctly handle malformed SVG, leading to a bypass of sanitization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Even though the SVG markup is not strictly valid, browsers can still interpret and execute it, which allows for cross-site scripting attacks. This is due to the browser's ability to handle some level of malformed markup.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through a crafted SVG file that bypasses the sanitizer.
*   **Compromised User Context:** The injected script can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other actions in the context of the victim user, leading to account compromise or data theft.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File Upload or Input:** An attacker can upload a crafted SVG file or submit malicious SVG data through a vulnerable application that uses the `svg_sanitizer`.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to interact with the malicious SVG content in some way, such as by opening the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Inject SVG:** The attacker needs the ability to inject SVG markup, either by uploading a file or submitting through a web form.
*   **User to Execute SVG:** The user must load the SVG content in their browser. This might involve a direct view in the application or a broader context where SVG files are used.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only requires low privileges or an authenticated user session to inject the malicious code.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content confirms that this vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability (CWE-79).
*   The CVSS score is given as AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, which translates to:
    *   **AV:N** (Network): Attack vector is over the network.
    *   **AC:L** (Low): Attack complexity is low.
    *   **PR:L** (Low): Privileges required are low.
    *   **UI:R** (Required): User interaction is required.
    *   **S:C** (Changed): Scope is changed (vulnerable component and user context).
    *   **C:L** (Low): Confidentiality impact is low.
    *   **I:L** (Low): Integrity impact is low.
    *   **A:N** (None): Availability impact is none.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the t3g/svg-sanitizer prior to 1.0.3.
*   The provided content includes the fix and recommends updating to version 1.0.3.
*   The advisory mentions that the markup is not valid, yet browsers evaluate it which is the core issue.

The content gives a clear overview of the vulnerability, its exploitation and the fix.
