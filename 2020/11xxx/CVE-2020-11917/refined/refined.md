[Suggested description]
An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.
When a backup file is created through the web interface, information on
all users, including passwords, can be found in cleartext in the
backup file. An attacker capable of accessing the web interface
can create the backup file.

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
Note that this means the application passwords are also stored on the device in plain text, otherwise they could not
be placed in the backup file in this manner.

Note that during normal functional use, the backup file is
not created.

and then use other vulnerabilities
to obtain access to the backup file, including the user's passwords.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application stores user information, including passwords, in plaintext and includes them in backup files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Passwords are stored in cleartext and included in backup files. Inadequate access controls allow creation of the backup file via the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain cleartext passwords and other user information by accessing a created backup file. This can lead to account compromise and further malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must be able to create or obtain a backup file through the device's web interface
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the device's web interface.
