Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11618:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The telnet service is hardcoded to start on boot, without any authentication, allowing any attacker on the local network to connect and gain root access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unsecured Telnet:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a Telnet service running by default, without any login prompts. This provides unauthenticated root access to the device.
*   **Outdated Kernel:** The devices use an outdated Linux kernel (3.10.23) that reached its end of life in 2017, meaning that no security updates are provided for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Insecure Protocols:** The weather app uses unencrypted HTTP for communication with AccuWeather servers, and RSS feeds, while also supporting HTTPS, fail to properly validate SSL certificates.
*   **Writable /config directory:** The /config directory allows for persistent storage, permitting the attacker to store malware payloads and custom settings that survive a factory reset.
*   **Lack of security best practices:** The device has many services enabled by default that are not necessary for its function and that should be disabled by default.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full Control:** Attackers can gain full root access to the device, allowing them to execute arbitrary code, install malware, and use the device for malicious purposes.
*   **Botnet Recruitment:** The devices can be infected with botnet malware such as Mirai. They can then be used to launch DDoS attacks, scan for other vulnerable devices, or participate in other malicious activities.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers on the local network can perform MiTM attacks to modify the data displayed in the weather app or RSS feeds. This can be used to display misleading information or even ransomware messages.
*   **DNS Hijacking:** Attackers can perform DNS hijacking to redirect the device to malicious servers, which would allow them to manipulate data being downloaded, or redirect user data to an attacker-controlled server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through a local network. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable DVB-T2 set-top box.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker with control of the network gateway can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify network traffic.
*   **DNS Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack DNS requests to redirect traffic to their servers. This can be done either at the router level or directly on the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Local Network Presence:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable set-top box to exploit the telnet service.
*   **Network Gateway Control (for MitM):** For MitM attacks on weather app and RSS feeds, the attacker needs to control the network gateway.
*   **DNS Server Control (for DNS Hijacking):** For DNS hijacking, the attacker needs a rogue DNS server.
