Vulnerability Details

CVE-2020-11637  Automation Runtime TFTP Service DoS Vulnerability

Description

The affected B&R Automation Runtime versions use an underlying operating system that in turn has a
TFTP service implementation. This TFTP service implementation has been found to have a memory
management issue, not releasing previously allocated memory. An attacker with the ability to send TFTP
requests to the system could exhaust the available system memory by sending specially crafted network
packets to the affected service.

Impact

Affected B&R Automation Runtime versions may be abused to continuously consume available memory.
This vulnerability may lead to denial of service (DoS) conditions, where interaction is hampered and
reliability of services are impacted.

Fix

The memory leak has been fixed at operating system level.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations:
TFTP communication should be restricted to legitimate network partners, using e.g. a sufficient Firewall
setup and robust network segmentation.

Supporting information and guidelines

The B&R Cyber Security webpage provides further information including Cyber Security guidelines.
