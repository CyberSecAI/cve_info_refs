- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory leak in the TFTP service implementation within the underlying operating system used by B&R Automation Runtime. The service does not release previously allocated memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak in the TFTP service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exhaust the available system memory by sending specially crafted network packets, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition, hampering interaction and impacting service reliability.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker with network access can send TFTP requests to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the affected system and the ability to send TFTP requests.
