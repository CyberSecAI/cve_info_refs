### Why is Telerik UI for Silverlight Retired?

Empowering development teams to deliver modern-looking solutions in less time requires a periodical revision of Progress Developer Tools offerings. It goes both ways – adding new products to meet evolving business needs and retiring products that have served their purpose. Investing our efforts in the right direction ensures you get the most up-to-date solutions to build engaging UI and elevate user experience.

## What Does Telerik UI for Silverlight Discontinuation Mean?

Starting December 1, 2023, Progress Software discontinued Telerik UI for Silverlight future purchases. Providing technical support and shipping critical fixes continued for a year until December 1, 2024. Effective December 1, 2024, Telerik UI for Silverlight is no longer offered as part of Progress Developer Tools portfolio.

To continue building engaging and highly functional digital experiences on modern frameworks, you can switch to Telerik and Kendo UI alternatives.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* 1. What was the deprecation date for Telerik UI for Silverlight?

  The deprecation date for Telerik UI for Silverlight was December 1, 2023. To ensure a smooth transition we continued to provide technical support and critical fixes until December 1, 2024.
* 2. What led to the decision to deprecate Telerik UI for Silverlight?

  Our decision to deprecate Telerik UI for Silverlight was driven by the evolution of technology and industry standards. We want to focus our resources on providing the best support for modern platforms and technologies.
* 3. What did the deprecation mean for Telerik UI for Silverlight users?

  When a product reaches the end of life, it means we no longer release updates or security patches (the [Microsoft Silverlight framework reached its end of life on October 12, 2021](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/silverlight-end-of-support-0a3be3c7-bead-e203-2dfd-74f0a64f1788)). Users could use Telerik UI for Silverlight until December 1, 2024, but we've always recommended them to switch to a supported platform for long-term compatibility and security.
* 4. I have purchased a Telerik DevCraft bundle. What changes should I expect?

  Effective December 1, 2023, any new Telerik DevCraft license no longer included Telerik UI for Silverlight. To ensure a smooth transition, we continued to provide support and critical fixes for all active clients for one year until December 1, 2024.
* 5. What resources and support were available after the deprecation date?

  Technical support through our standard channels (tickets, forums, documentation, knowledge base) was available until December 1, 2024.
* 6. What were the migration options if users wanted to continue using Telerik controls in web applications?

  We recommended migrating to a supported technology stack: Telerik and Kendo UI for other platforms like ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, React or other modern web frameworks.
* 7. Who should I contact in terms of additional questions?

  If you have any additional questions not covered on this page, do not hesitate to [contact us](/end-of-life-queries?preselect=ui-for-silverlight) or reach out to your Account Manager.
