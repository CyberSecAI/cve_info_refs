Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-11842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an information disclosure issue within the Verastream Host Integrator (VHI) product.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is that the software allows unauthenticated attackers to access information they should not have access to. This suggests a lack of proper access control or authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Access:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to view sensitive information without authentication. The specific type or sensitivity of this information is not detailed, but the potential impact is a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attack can be carried out over a network (AV:N), meaning the attacker does not need local access to the system.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for the attacker to authenticate to the application (PR:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote User:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable VHI server. No prior authentication or access is required.
*   **Basic Networking:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP or similar requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects VHI versions earlier than 7.8 Update 1 (specifically, versions earlier than 7.8.49 or 7.8.0.49).
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading to VHI 7.8 Update 1 (or later) resolves the vulnerability.
*   **Specific Note for "HTML5 Web Application" Projects:** Customers who used the Web Builder with the project type "HTML5 Web Application" need to contact support and regenerate their code after applying the update. This indicates a potential vulnerability in the generated code of this type.

In summary, CVE-2020-11842 describes an easily exploitable vulnerability in Verastream Host Integrator that allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to view potentially sensitive information. Upgrading to the latest version is crucial for mitigation.
