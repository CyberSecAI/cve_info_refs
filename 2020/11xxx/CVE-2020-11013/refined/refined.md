Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-11013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `lookup` function in Helm, introduced in version 3. This function allows Helm templates to query resources in a Kubernetes cluster. The vulnerability occurs because this lookup function connects to the cluster even during `helm template` and `helm install|update|delete|rollback --dry-run` commands, which are not intended to interact with a cluster. This behavior bypasses the documented restriction that `helm template` should not connect to a remote cluster.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The `lookup` function, when used in a malicious Helm chart, can connect to the cluster specified in the user's `KUBECONFIG` file and extract information about resources. This information can then be revealed via the output of `helm template`.
*   **Unintended Network Connections:** The `helm template` command, which should not make cluster calls, makes unannounced lookups to the cluster. This contradicts user expectations and opens up a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** A malicious chart author could craft a Helm chart with embedded `lookup` calls that extract information from a user's Kubernetes cluster and expose that information through the output of `helm template`. This could reveal sensitive data about the cluster configuration, deployed resources, and potentially other secrets exposed in the cluster.
*   **Lack of User Awareness:** Users are not notified that the `helm template` command (or dry-run commands) are making connections to their cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Helm Charts:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious Helm chart that contains a `lookup` function within its templates.
*   **Unsuspecting Users:**  Users who use `helm template` or dry-run commands on these malicious charts are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Chart Authoring:** The attacker must be able to create and distribute malicious Helm charts.
*   **Distribution:** The attacker needs a way to get users to use the malicious Helm charts. This could be achieved through public repositories, private distribution methods, or social engineering.
*   **No Prior Access Needed:** The attacker doesn't need prior access to the user's cluster, as the vulnerability is triggered by the user's own Helm client and `KUBECONFIG` settings.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Helm versions 3.0.0 to 3.1.2 are affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Patched Versions:** Helm versions 3.1.3 and 3.2.0 contain a fix.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Running `helm lint` on an untrusted chart (this would fail due to another bug, also fixed in 3.2.0, if the lookup function is used).
    *   Setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to point to an empty Kubernetes configuration file.
    *   Manually analyzing the chart for the presence of the `lookup` function in any file in the `templates/` directory.
