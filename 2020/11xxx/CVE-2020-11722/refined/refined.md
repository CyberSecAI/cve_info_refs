Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11722:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS) game's handling of Lua scripts within user-uploaded `.crawlrc` configuration files. Specifically, the `load` and `loadstring` functions in the Lua 5.1 environment, used to process these scripts, can be exploited to load and execute arbitrary Lua bytecode.  The Lua bytecode verifier had known weaknesses and could be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Bytecode Loading:** The core issue is that `load` and `loadstring` in Lua 5.1 allows loading and execution of arbitrary bytecode, not just valid Lua scripts.
*  **Weak Bytecode Verification:** Lua 5.1's bytecode verifier has known weaknesses, allowing attackers to craft malicious bytecode that passes verification and executes arbitrary code.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a specially crafted `.crawlrc` file containing malicious Lua bytecode, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server running the DCSS game.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the game.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control of the server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further malicious activities.
*   **ASLR bypass:** The attacker can bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to execute code by calculating the base address of the text segment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Uploaded Configuration Files:** The primary attack vector is uploading a malicious `.crawlrc` file to a public DCSS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload their own `.crawlrc` configuration file to a vulnerable DCSS server.
*  **Knowledge of Lua Bytecode Exploits:** The attacker needs technical knowledge to craft malicious Lua bytecode that can bypass the verifier and achieve code execution.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable DCSS server.
*   **Server-Side Execution:** The vulnerability is server-side, meaning the attacker's malicious code executes on the server hosting the DCSS instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided blog post details how an existing Redis exploit was adapted to attack DCSS using the same underlying Lua bytecode weaknesses.
*   The blog post also provides technical details on how to find the system() function in libc and how to compute the start of the text segment on the target system to bypass ASLR.
*   The fix involves disabling bytecode loading from `load/loadstring` by checking if the input begins with the bytecode marker (0x1b).
*   The issue is not resolved by upgrading to Lua 5.2 or 5.3 because the bytecode verifier was completely removed in Lua 5.2, opening up other exploitation opportunities.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in DCSS commits fc522ff and 768f60d which disabled the ability to load bytecode.
*   The vulnerability is present in public DCSS servers, affecting all OS variants that are used to host the game servers.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having "high" or "important" severity.

**Summary of the Fix:**

The vulnerability was resolved by disabling the loading of Lua bytecode within the game.  This was done by checking the first byte of the input to `loadstring` or `load`. If that first byte is 0x1b, the function call aborts, blocking execution of the bytecode.
