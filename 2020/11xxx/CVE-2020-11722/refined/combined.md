[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup), aka DCSS, aka
“crawl”, is an open source Rogue-like game, available at <https://github.com/crawl/crawl>. Public
DCSS servers (crawl.kelbi.org, crawl.develz.org, crawl.akrasiac.org, underhound.eu, crawl.beRotato.org, lazy-life.ddo.jp,
webzook.net, crawl.xtahua.com, crawl.project357.org) allow users to
play DCSS without compiling it or installing it on their own system. On these
servers, before starting a game players can upload their own .crawlrc
configuration file. These files can include Lua 5.1 scripts, and the global
environment for these scripts includes the load
and loadstring
functions. load and loadstring
can be used to load not just other Lua scripts, but also valid *or invalid*
Lua bytecode. Although Lua 5.1 includes a perfunctory bytecode verifier, there
are known weaknesses in that verifier which have been well documented in the
security community.

I was able
to adapt the exploit described at <https://github.com/sghctoma/gamehack-defcon23/blob/master/demo6_logitech/redis_exploits/Redis_RCE_v2.pdf>,
which was itself based on <https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486>,
to attack DCSS and successfully launch a shell. My exploits are available at <https://pastebin.com/36Z5iMa8> and <https://pastebin.com/5Gkfvab4>. They
achieve arbitrary memory reads and writes via the known bytecode weaknesses,
and then locate the system(3) function in libc. system
is then invoked repeatedly to execute the list of commands; in my exploits, these
are /usr/bin/reset
and /bin/sh.
The exploits can be used against any of the public DCSS servers to achieve
remote code execution.

My exploits assume the system is running 64-bit Linux. The above links describe how the
attack can be applied to 32-bit systems and Windows systems as well, so any
public DCSS system regardless of OS is vulnerable. But if you are on 64-bit
Linux, the only additional modification you need to make to my exploits is to this
line:
local
pht\_offset\_from\_auxwrap = **0x8ba060**

To defeat
ASLR, the exploits compute the beginning address of the text segment instead of
hardcoding it. They first find the memory address of the luaB\_auxwrap function
and then subtract pht\_offset\_from\_auxwrap. A real attacker would script a
brute-force attack to determine the correct value for pht\_offset\_from\_auxwrap on a given server. There is a limited
range for the correct value, so a few hundred attempts should be enough. To
determine the correct value for a system without a brute-force attack, use /proc/<pid>/maps
to determine the start of the text segment and then subtract this value from &luaB\_auxwrap.

First, luaB\_auxwrap:
(gdb) print &luaB\_auxwrap
$1 = (<text variable, no debug info> \*)
**0x555555e0e060** <luaB\_auxwrap>

Next, the
start of the DCSS text segment:
$ ps -ef | grep crawl
dmenden+ 243 8 0 15:06 pts/0 00:00:00 gdb
./crawl
dmenden+ **249** 243 1 15:08 pts/0
00:00:00 /home/dmendenhall/crawl/crawl-ref/source/crawl
$ cat /proc/249/maps
**555555554000**-55555605d000 r-xp 00000000 08:10 315161
/home/dmendenhall/crawl/crawl-ref/source/crawl
55555605d000-555556094000 r--p 00b08000 08:10
315161 /home/dmendenhall/crawl/crawl-ref/source/crawl
555556094000-5555560cb000 rw-p 00b3f000 08:10
315161 /home/dmendenhall/crawl/crawl-ref/source/crawl 5
[...]

The very
first number in this output (0x555555554000) is the start of the text segment.

Finally:
**0x555555e0e060 - 0x555555554000 = 0x8ba060**

**Patch**

To address
this vulnerability, I recommended either disabling load/loadstring entirely in the .crawlrc Lua environment, or disabling
bytecode loading from load/loadstring.
All bytecode chunks will begin with the byte 0x1b
(\27 decimal). No Lua script
chunks will begin with this byte, so testing this first byte should be enough
to block any bytecode.

I also
recommended disabling the printing of function addresses
{
print(function() end) },
as this
provides another vector for defeating ASLR (not used in my exploits).

Note that an
upgrade to Lua 5.2 or Lua 5.3 will not resolve the vulnerability. loadstring was renamed to load, but the ability to load bytecode
at runtime is otherwise still available. The bytecode verifier was also completely
removed starting in Lua 5.2, making other exploits possible. These other
exploits are also well-documented in the security community.

The DCSS developers ultimately fixed this vulnerability in commits [fc522ff](https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/fc522ff6eb1bbb85e3de60c60a45762571e48c28) and [768f60d](https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/768f60da87a3fa0b5561da5ade9309577c176d04).

**UPDATE 4/12/20:** MITRE has issued [CVE-2020-11722](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11722) for this bug

### [DoSing a Public NetHack Server](https://dpmendenhall.blogspot.com/2020/05/dosing-public-nethack-server.html)

[May 18, 2020](https://dpmendenhall.blogspot.com/2020/05/dosing-public-nethack-server.html "permanent link")

What AFL found During fuzzing (as described here ), AFL reported a hang on this .nethackrc line: MENUCOLOR=0+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=blue This line is saying that if a menu item matches the regular expression (in this case, one or more ‘0’ characters), then that line should be colored blue in the UI. Only one ‘+’ character is needed to express this, but if you string many ‘+’ characters together, NetHack will hang. I was also able to reproduce the hang with MSGTYPE and AUTOPICKUP\_EXCEPTION lines. So why does it hang? NetHack 3.6/3.7 has a pluggable API for regular expression engines in sys/share . Three implementations of this API are included in the source: posixregex.c – Uses the POSIX API from /usr/include/regex.h , which is implemented via the platform’s libc. This is the default on Unix. cppregex.cpp – Uses the C++ standard library available in <regex> , which is implemented via the platform’s libc++. This the default on Windows. Obviously, ...

### [NetHack 3.6.6, or, How to Glitch NetHack](https://dpmendenhall.blogspot.com/2020/03/nethack-366-or-how-to-glitch-nethack.html)

[March 09, 2020](https://dpmendenhall.blogspot.com/2020/03/nethack-366-or-how-to-glitch-nethack.html "permanent link")

The NetHack DevTeam released NetHack 3.6.6 on March 8, 2020, primarily to address CVE-2020-5254 , which  I reported to them on March 3. Although most of my report was focused on security--and indeed I was able to get full remote code execution (RCE) on pre-release NetHack 3.7 (but not 3.6.5)--I actually thought the more interesting finding was how to exploit the bug as a glitch.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")

* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.
