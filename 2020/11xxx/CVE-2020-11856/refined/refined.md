Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11856

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the configuration of the Java Management Extensions (JMX) remote interface in Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter. The JMX interface allows for the registration of MBeans.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The JMX interface lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to interact with it.
- **Insecure MBean Registration:** The lack of authentication allows attackers to register their own, attacker-controlled MBeans.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By registering malicious MBeans, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system with SYSTEM privileges. This allows for complete system compromise.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  The vulnerability leads to unauthorized access to the OBR server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or user credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability affects Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter versions 10.40 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by Pedro Ribeiro of Agile Information Security, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Micro Focus has released a patch to address the vulnerability.
