The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains, which includes information about CVE-2020-11938.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that a project administrator in TeamCity was able to see scrambled password parameters used in a project.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of password parameters, even though they were intended to be scrambled/masked. This suggests a failure in proper access control and data masking within the TeamCity application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A project administrator, who should not have access to the actual password parameters, could view them. This leads to unauthorized information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the TeamCity web interface, accessible to project administrators. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have project administrator privileges within TeamCity.
