Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11719:

**CVE Description:** The provided description is a placeholder. However, based on the included content, it is a broken encryption vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of outdated and broken encryption within the "Programi Bilanc" software.
- Additionally, the encryption key is static and guessable, and is present in the source code of the software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Encryption:** The encryption algorithm used is weak and easily breakable.
- **Static Encryption Key:** The usage of a static key makes it easy to decrypt data if the key is obtained.
- **Key in Source Code:** Embedding the static key in the software's source code makes it trivially accessible to local attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Decryption:** Remote attackers can decrypt data with minimal effort due to the weak encryption.
- **Data Exposure:** Local attackers with access to the software's source code can obtain the static key, allowing them to decrypt sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit the weak encryption remotely if they intercept the encrypted data.
- **Local Attack:** Attackers with access to the software installation or source code can extract the static key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** Needs access to network traffic containing encrypted data or access to an application that is using the vulnerable software.
- **Local Attacker:** Needs local access to the software's installation files or source code.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-11719 describes a critical vulnerability in "Programi Bilanc" due to the use of weak and broken encryption, along with a static and guessable encryption key embedded in the source code. This allows both remote and local attackers to decrypt sensitive data.
