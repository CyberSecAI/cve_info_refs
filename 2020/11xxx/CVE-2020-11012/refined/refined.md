Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing `return` statement in the `validateAdminSignature` function within `cmd/auth-handler.go`. This oversight allowed the code to proceed further even when the signature validation failed, which bypasses the intended authentication mechanism for admin API requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the MinIO admin API. Due to the missing `return` statement, a request with an invalid signature could still proceed and execute admin actions.
- **Incomplete Signature Validation:** The `validateAdminSignature` function, responsible for verifying the authenticity of admin API requests, was flawed due to the missing return.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Admin Access:** An attacker with knowledge of a valid admin access key could execute admin API operations without knowing the corresponding secret key.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could create new service accounts with admin privileges, gaining full control over the MinIO instance.
- **Data Tampering/Loss:** With unauthorized admin access, attackers could potentially tamper with data, delete buckets, or cause other significant damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the MinIO server and knowledge of a valid admin access key.
- **Admin API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exploited via the MinIO admin API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Admin Access Key:** The attacker must possess a valid admin access key.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the MinIO server's admin API.
- **No Need for Admin Secret Key:** The attacker does not need the corresponding admin secret key due to the authentication bypass.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was located in `cmd/auth-handler.go` specifically in the `validateAdminSignature` function.
- The fix involved adding a missing `return` statement to prevent further execution when signature validation fails.
- The vulnerability was addressed in the release `RELEASE.2020-04-23T00-58-49Z` with the fix being introduced by the commit `4cd6ca02c7957aeb2de3eede08b0754332a77923`.

**Additional Notes:**
- This was identified as a critical security issue requiring immediate patching/upgrading by users.
- The issue was discovered during an internal security audit.
- The vulnerability was not observed in the wild or reported elsewhere in the community.
- The fix was included in the pull request #9422.
- The advisory (GHSA-xv4r-vccv-mg4w) was published on April 23, 2020.
