# MinIO Admin API security issue

High

[harshavardhana](/harshavardhana)
published
GHSA-xv4r-vccv-mg4w
Apr 23, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

RELEASE.2019-12-17T23-16-33Z

## Patched versions

RELEASE.2020-04-23T00-58-49Z

## Description

During an internal security audit, we detected an authentication bypass issue in the MinIO admin API. The security issue has been reported internally. We have not observed this exploit in the wild or reported elsewhere in the community at large. All users are advised to upgrade ASAP.

### Impact

Given an admin access key, it is possible to perform admin API operations i.e. creating new service accounts for existing access keys without knowing the admin secret key. This security issue was found during a regular internal security audit.

### Patches

This issue was fixed by [@vadmeste](https://github.com/vadmeste) in PR [#9422](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/9422)

### Binary Download

Please download the latest server binary that contains the fix from
