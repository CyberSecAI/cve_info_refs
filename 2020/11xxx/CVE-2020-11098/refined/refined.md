Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-11098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an out-of-bounds read in the `glyph_cache_put` function within the FreeRDP library. Specifically, the code reads data from the glyph cache using an index without proper validation, potentially accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary weakness is that the code reads data from the glyph cache using an index without sufficient validation to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   -  An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from memory outside of the intended bounds and lead to a crash or denial of service. Although not explicitly mentioned in all sources, the out-of-bounds read can potentially cause information disclosure or lead to a crash of the FreeRDP client due to invalid memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**
   -  The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious or manipulated RDP server sending specially crafted data relating to glyph cache entries to the FreeRDP client. This can occur over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to a FreeRDP client, typically by controlling the RDP server.
   - **Malicious Server:** The attacker requires control over or the ability to influence a RDP server to send crafted data.

**Additional Details:**
   - The vulnerability affects FreeRDP clients where the glyph-cache option is enabled. The glyph-cache is disabled by default.
   - The vulnerability is fixed in FreeRDP version 2.1.2.

The provided information indicates that the vulnerability has been addressed in various distributions of Linux by upgrading the FreeRDP packages to version 2.1.2 or higher. The patches also address other related CVEs.
