Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-11555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application stores sensitive information, including user credentials and device access credentials, in database backup files without any encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unencrypted Data Storage:** The primary weakness is the lack of encryption for sensitive data within the backup files. This allows attackers to easily extract credentials and other sensitive information if they gain access to these files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** Exploitation leads to the disclosure of user credentials (usernames and passwords) for the SNMPc application itself, as well as credentials used for SNMP polling of managed devices.
*   **Full Administrative Control:** With exposed credentials, attackers can gain full administrative control of the Network Management System (NMS).
*   **Lateral Movement:** Exposed device credentials could potentially lead to further access within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** Attackers need access to the backup files on the server to extract the data.
*   **Chained Exploit:** In this specific scenario, the attacker uses a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to force the server to backup the database to an attacker-controlled location via an SMB share. The attacker then accesses the backup files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Access:** An attacker must be able to trigger the backup function through a CSRF vulnerability, and also have an SMB server available and accessible by the target NMS server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering to trick a legitimate user into clicking a malicious link that triggers the XSS payload which in turn triggers the CSRF and the backup process.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** They need to be able to set up a web server, an SMB share and the ability to extract cleartext information using tools such as strings.

**Additional Notes:**

* The article demonstrates the chaining of multiple vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, and unencrypted backups) to achieve a high-impact exploit.
* The exploit provides a pathway to gain complete control of the NMS system.
