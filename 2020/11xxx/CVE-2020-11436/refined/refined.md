Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-11436:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `note` parameter of the `/librehealthehr/controller.php` endpoint does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected document notes.
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can potentially leverage the XSS vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of other users, possibly including privilege escalation.
- Server-side code execution: The provided exploit chains the XSS with an insecure file upload vulnerability to achieve server-side code execution, demonstrating the severity of the flaw.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be performed remotely via HTTP requests.
- The malicious payload is injected through a POST request to `/librehealthehr/controller.php` with the vulnerable `note` parameter.
- The payload is triggered when a user views the notes on the affected document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate as a low-privileged user, specifically a "Front Desk" user, to create a new document and add the malicious XSS payload in the note section.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious javascript payload.
