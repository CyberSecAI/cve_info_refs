Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application (ArcSight Logger), which are then executed when other users access the affected areas of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session who is accessing the vulnerable application.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web application.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via a web interface.
- Attacker injects malicious scripts into a field or parameter that is later rendered on a page without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account with permissions to inject malicious scripts into specific areas of the ArcSight Logger web interface.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable input fields or parameters to exploit.
- It should be noted that the CVSS vector indicates the vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated user (PR:N). However, the text description indicates a "remote exploit" and "a valid user account with permissions", which are contradictory.
- Successful exploitation requires that a victim user (with sufficient permissions) view the injected malicious script via the vulnerable area of the web UI.

**Affected Versions:**
- Micro Focus ArcSight Logger versions 6.6.1 up to 7.0.1.

**Resolution:**
- Apply the hotfix "Logger 7.0.1 hotfix CVE-2020-11839" on ArcSight Logger 7.01, either in software or appliance form factor.
- The fix will also be part of the upcoming release of Logger.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by ING Tech Poland.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 (or 6.1 according to another source within the content), and 4.9 base score on CVSS v2.
