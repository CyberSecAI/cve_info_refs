Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-11535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an XML injection flaw within ONLYOFFICE Document Server 5.5.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate XML input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's server. This is achieved by injecting attacker-controlled parameters into the `x2t` binary which can be leveraged to overwrite critical system files like  `libxcb.so.1`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DOCX File:** The attacker crafts a specially designed DOCX file.
*   **XML Injection:** The crafted DOCX file uses XML injection to inject malicious parameters.
*   **Binary Overwrite:** The injected parameters cause the `x2t` binary to overwrite a system library such as `libxcb.so.1`
*   **Code Execution:** Overwriting system libraries allows for remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious DOCX file:** The attacker must possess the skill to create a malformed DOCX document.
*   **Remote access:** The attacker needs a method to deliver the malicious DOCX file to the target system, likely via email, shared file server, or web interface.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability is present in ONLYOFFICE Document Server version 5.5.0.
* The vulnerability is classified as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
* The attack is considered to be remote.
* The vulnerability was discovered by the Yandex Security Team, specifically Andrew Krasichkov.
