The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `cpp-httplib` library, specifically related to HTTP response splitting. This aligns with the described CVE which would have the same root cause and impact.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `set_header` and `set_redirect` functions in the `cpp-httplib` library not sanitizing or validating header values. Specifically, these functions allow the injection of carriage return (`\r`) and newline (`\n`) characters into HTTP headers. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary headers or even a new HTTP response within the existing response, leading to HTTP Response Splitting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The core weakness is the lack of input sanitization in `set_header` and `set_redirect` functions. This allows an attacker to manipulate the HTTP response headers by injecting CRLF sequences (\r\n).
- **Unvalidated Input:** The library directly uses the provided header values in the `write_format` function without proper encoding or escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Header Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response. This could be used to set malicious cookies, modify content type, or other header related attacks.
- **Response Hijacking:** By injecting a complete second HTTP response, an attacker could potentially control the content of the response seen by the client. This allows for phishing, cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to endpoints that utilize the vulnerable `set_header` or `set_redirect` functions, passing a crafted string containing `\r\n` sequences as header values or redirect URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable code.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the values passed to the `set_header` and `set_redirect` functions, directly or indirectly through a request.

The provided code snippets in the gist and the issue report demonstrate the vulnerability and provide a proof-of-concept. The author of the library confirmed the vulnerability and released a fix in version v0.5.9.
