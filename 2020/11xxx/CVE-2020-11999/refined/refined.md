Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-11999:

**CVE-2020-11999 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
*   **Root Cause:** An exposed API call in Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk Linx software allows users to provide files for processing without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to control file processing.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can specify a filename that can execute unauthorized code, modify files, or alter data. This could lead to remote code execution and data manipulation.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An exposed API call is used to submit files.
    *   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely (AV:N) and with low skill level.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Attacker needs to have the ability to send requests to the exposed API.
    *   Low privileges (PR:L) are required to exploit the vulnerability.
