Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-11551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The Netgear Orbi Pro WiFi Mesh system uses a SOAP interface for communication between the router/access point and the mesh satellites. This interface is intended for internal communication but is publicly accessible on the local network via HTTP on port 80.
-   The authentication mechanism for this SOAP interface uses a hardcoded username ("orbi") and a password generated by an MD5 hash of a secret string. This secret string is derived from the last three octets of the MAC addresses of both communicating devices (the source and the target). This allows an attacker to calculate the authentication password based on publicly available information (MAC addresses).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Weak Authentication:** The password generation method is weak as it relies on publicly available MAC addresses. This allows an attacker to easily calculate the password.
2.  **Undocumented Public API:** The SOAP API is not intended to be public, but it is accessible on the local network without proper protection.
3.  **Cleartext Communication:** The SOAP API uses HTTP for communication, which transmits authentication data in clear text, although not between clients.
4.  **Lack of Cryptographic Protection:**  The communication channel lacks proper encryption and integrity checks, relying solely on the weak authentication method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Configuration Modification:** An attacker can remotely write arbitrary WiFi configuration data on Netgear Orbi Pro WiFi Mesh satellites. This includes changes to authentication details, network settings, DNS, system administration interface configuration, etc.
-   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability and others, an attacker can gain remote code execution on the Mesh-satellites and eventually administrative access to the Router/Access Point and the whole network.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for the leak of sensitive information such as SSIDs and pre-shared keys (PSKs) of all configured WiFis.
-   **Complete System Compromise**: By gaining root access on the Mesh satellites, the attacker can then obtain the original admin password for the main router/AP which is also synced to the satellites in cleartext over HTTP.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the wired network or the main WiFi network of the Netgear Orbi Pro Mesh system or another network segment that has access to the management interfaces. If WiFi client isolation is disabled and the "employee network" is allowed to access network nodes in LAN (e.g. printers, etc.) the attacker could also be on the employee network.
-  **SOAP Request Forgery:** By crafting specific SOAP requests to the affected interface, an attacker can perform the desired actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network or have access to a network segment that can reach the administrative interfaces of the Netgear Orbi Pro system.
-   **Understanding of SOAP API:** While exploits are available publicly, understanding the SOAP API can be helpful in crafting specific attacks.
-   **Ability to calculate the password:** The attacker must be able to calculate the MD5 hash using the MAC addresses of the communicating devices.
