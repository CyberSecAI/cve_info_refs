Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is located in the `update_read_bitmap_data` function of FreeRDP. The function reads bitmap data from a stream. If bitmap compression is enabled and the `NO_BITMAP_COMPRESSION_HDR` flag is not set, the function reads additional data ( `cbCompFirstRowSize`, `cbCompMainBodySize`, `cbScanWidth`, `cbUncompressedSize` ) from the stream without verifying if enough bytes are available. This leads to an out-of-bounds read if the stream is shorter than expected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is that the code reads data from the stream without checking if sufficient bytes are present in the stream after initial 18 byte read and conditional checks, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
-   **Missing bounds check:** There is a missing check on stream length before reading the additional bitmap compression header data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read allows a malicious RDP server to read arbitrary client memory.
-   **Visual Artifacts:**  The read memory is then used to construct the bitmap data, causing visual artifacts to be displayed on the client screen.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious RDP server:** An attacker can control a malicious RDP server to send a crafted bitmap update message. This message exploits the lack of bounds checking in the `update_read_bitmap_data` function.
-   **RDP connection:** The vulnerability is triggered when a FreeRDP client connects to a malicious or compromised RDP server and receives a specially crafted bitmap update.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Man-in-the-middle:** An attacker could potentially intercept and modify server responses to inject the malicious data.
-   **RDP server control:** The attacker needs to control or compromise the RDP server to send the specially crafted bitmap data that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

-   The provided content includes the fix for the vulnerability: a check `if (Stream_GetRemainingLength(s) < 8)` is added to verify if the stream has enough bytes before reading additional bitmap compression header data.
-   The vulnerability affects FreeRDP versions after 1.0 and before 2.0.0.
-   This vulnerability is classified as low severity, but could leak potentially sensitive information.
-   The issue is also referenced in Ubuntu security notices USN-4379-1, USN-4382-1, and Debian LTS advisories DLA-2356-1, DLA-3606-1.
-   This issue is fixed by commit `f8890a645c221823ac133dbf991f8a65ae50d637`.
