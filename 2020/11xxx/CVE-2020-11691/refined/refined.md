The provided content is related to CVE-2020-11691.

**Summary:** The JetBrains Security Bulletin Q1 2020 lists a vulnerability in Hub, identified as CVE-2020-11691, that allowed content spoofing in Hub OAuth error messages.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be related to insufficient sanitization or validation of data used in generating OAuth error messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Content Spoofing. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the Hub OAuth error message.

**Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially mislead users by displaying a crafted OAuth error message, possibly leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities by disguising legitimate looking content.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the Hub OAuth error message, likely via a crafted or malicious URL, or manipulating request parameters during the OAuth process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker likely needs to be able to manipulate the parameters of the OAuth process in order to trigger the error and inject the malicious content, or craft a malicious request that would trigger the vulnerability, requiring some level of interaction with the Hub application's OAuth flow.
