Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11529

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the redirect route in the `Grav.php` file before performing a redirect. Specifically, the code uses a regular expression to clean the route, but it's not robust enough to handle specific crafted payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external website. The vulnerability is present in the `redirect` function within `system/src/Grav/Common/Grav.php`.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The regular expression used to clean the route is not comprehensive, and it can be bypassed using a crafted URL containing a combination of forward slashes, backslashes, and URL encoded characters.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `Redirect trailing slash` is turned on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites that mimic legitimate sites to steal credentials or personal information.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to websites that host malware.
- **SEO Manipulation:** Attackers can redirect users to websites that benefit their search engine rankings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a combination of encoded characters (`%2f`, `%5c`) and forward/backslashes. The crafted payload bypasses the sanitization and allows the redirect to an arbitrary URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not require any special access to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User interaction is required:** The attacker needs to entice a user to click the crafted URL.
- **Network access:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `redirect()` function of the `system/src/Grav/Common/Grav.php` file.
- The commit `2eae104c7a4bf32bc26cb8073d5c40464bfda3f7` addresses this vulnerability, attempting to fix the path-based open redirect issue.
- The vulnerability is present in Grav versions prior to 1.6.23.
- The following payload demonstrates the open redirect: `https://yourdomain.example/%252f%255cwelovetoexploit%252fa%253fb/`. This redirects to `welovetoexploit/a?b`.
- The fix implemented in commit `2eae104` is not fully effective and can be bypassed. This was later fixed in Grav 1.7.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is more significant when Grav is installed in the root folder of a domain as opposed to a subfolder.
- The vulnerability is related to how Grav handles trailing slashes and redirects.
