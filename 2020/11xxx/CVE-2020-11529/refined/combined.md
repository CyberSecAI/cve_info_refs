## Summary

Hello [@rhukster](https://github.com/rhukster)

I would like to report a bypass to this that I have found

I'm the same person that reports the actual open redirect via email which was assigned to [CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11529#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle)

Looks like this payload can reproduce the open redirect again

[Open Redirect](https://getgrav.org/bypass%3A/%5Cexample.com/)

## POC

This is fixed in Grav 1.7RC, but not yet in Grav 1.6 (which getgrav.org runs).

## Description

![@Rotzbua](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7337347?v=4&size=48)[Rotzbua](https://github.com/Rotzbua)opened [on Jan 6, 2021](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/issues/3134#issue-780624397)
## Environment

grav version: v1.6.31 - Admin v1.9.19

php: 7.4 and 7.2 tested

## Problem

If grav is on root folder on a domain it seems there is a open redirect.

## Fist analysis

Origin of the problem seems to be the redirect by setting `Redirect trailing slash` on.

## Examples

Open redirect if on root folder:

<https://yourdomain.example/%252f%255cwelovetoexploit%252fa%253fb/>

Response header (short):

> 302 Found
>
> location | /\welovetoexploit/a?b

It redirects to: `welovetoexploit/a?b`

---

Less(?) a problem if in subfolder:

<https://yourdomain.example/gravsubfolder/%252f%255cwelovetoexploit%252fa%253fb/>

Response header (short):

> 302 Found
>
> location /gravsubfolder/\welovetoexploit/a?b

---

Current version 1.7 seems to be fixed example:

<https://getgrav.org/%252f%255cwelovetoexploit%252fa%253fb/>

## Summary

Hello [@rhukster](https://github.com/rhukster)

I would like to report a bypass to this that I have found

I'm the same person that reports the actual open redirect via email which was assigned to [CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11529#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle)

Looks like this payload can reproduce the open redirect again

[Open Redirect](https://getgrav.org/bypass%3A/%5Cexample.com/)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
