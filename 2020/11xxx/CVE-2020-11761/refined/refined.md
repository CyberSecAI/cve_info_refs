Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2020-11761:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read during Huffman uncompression, specifically within the `FastHufDecoder::refill` function located in `ImfFastHuf.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Out-of-bounds read: The `FastHufDecoder::refill` function attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer when decompressing Huffman encoded data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds read could lead to a crash, causing a denial of service.
*   Potential arbitrary code execution: Some sources indicate that it *could potentially* allow arbitrary code execution, although this is not confirmed across all sources.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector involves processing maliciously crafted EXR image files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed EXR file to the vulnerable system or application.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into processing the crafted image.

**Summary of Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is located within the Huffman decompression routine (`FastHufDecoder::refill`).
*   The specific weakness lies in the way the code refills the buffer.
*   An attacker can exploit this by crafting an EXR file which, when processed, causes the `FastHufDecoder::refill` function to attempt to read memory outside of the allocated buffer, leading to a crash or other potential exploits.
*   This vulnerability is present in OpenEXR versions prior to 2.4.1.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing specifically crafted EXR files.
*   Several sources highlight the potential for arbitrary code execution but focus primarily on the out-of-bounds read leading to DoS.
*   Multiple vendors including Apple, Debian, and SUSE, have released security updates to address this vulnerability along with other related CVEs in OpenEXR.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have moderate severity by most sources, with CVSS v3 scores ranging from 3.3 to 5.5 depending on the vendor.
*  The EPSS score is low, indicating that this specific CVE has not been widely exploited
*  The vulnerability affects various platforms like Windows, macOS, iOS, and Linux.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Xingwei Lin of Ant-Financial Light-Year Security Lab.
