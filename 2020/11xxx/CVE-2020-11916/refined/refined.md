[Suggested description]
An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.
It uses a default SSID value, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
discover the physical locations of many Siime Eye devices, violating the
privacy of users who do not wish to disclose their ownership of this type of device.
(Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
The access point is only detectable when the device is turned on. As the device is turned on for limited times less
devices are detected via Wigle then one might expect.

Wigle.net is a site which maps SSIDs to physical locations. Using this
site, it is possible to filter on specific SSIDs. When a filter is
applied to find the default SSID of the Siime Eye, it is possible to
find several devices across the globe. The map shown on wigle shows an
approximate physical location for the device and hence makes physical
or physical proximity attacks more likely.

In addition it violates the user's privacy as everyone on the internet
is capable of detecting where the devices are being used.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device uses a default SSID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure due to the use of a default SSID.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can discover the physical locations of devices, violating user privacy. The location can be mapped using services like wigle.net. This can also make physical proximity attacks more likely.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can use the default SSID and search for it on wigle.net to find devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs access to the internet and a service like wigle.net.
