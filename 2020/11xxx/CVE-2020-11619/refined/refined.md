After analyzing the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-11619:

**1. CVE Description:**
The vulnerability is in `FasterXML jackson-databind` versions prior to 2.9.10.4. It involves a mishandling of the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, specifically related to `org.springframework.aop.config.MethodLocatingFactoryBean` (aka `spring-aop`). This allows a malicious actor to potentially execute arbitrary code.

**2. Root Cause:**
The root cause is the unsafe deserialization of objects due to mishandling of polymorphic types and serialization gadgets in `jackson-databind`. This can lead to unexpected method calls and code execution. Specifically, using class names as type identifiers allows the attacker to specify which class is instantiated during deserialization. This enables the attacker to use a specially crafted JSON payload containing a malicious class.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsafe deserialization of objects with polymorphic type handling
- Vulnerability to serialization gadget attacks
- Insecure use of class names as type identifiers.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Disclosure of sensitive information
- Addition or modification of data
- Denial of Service (DoS)

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- Sending maliciously crafted JSON payloads to vulnerable systems.
- Exploiting applications that use `jackson-databind` for JSON parsing with default typing enabled or using `java.lang.Object`, `java.util.Serializable` or `java.util.Comparable` as polymorphic type

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary JSON payloads to the vulnerable application. 
- The vulnerable application must have the targeted "gadget" class in its classpath.
- Polymorphic type handling must be enabled and vulnerable types must be used.
- The attacker must be able to identify vulnerable versions and construct malicious payloads.

**Additional notes from the content:**

*   **Oracle's View:** Oracle has addressed this vulnerability in several products. They emphasize that the use of class names as type identifiers with default typing and vulnerable types make systems susceptible to this kind of attack.
*  **Debian LTS:** Debian LTS has also released a security update for jackson-databind to fix this and other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-10968, CVE-2020-10969, CVE-2020-11111, CVE-2020-11112, CVE-2020-11113, CVE-2020-11620).
*   **GitHub Advisory:** GitHub also has an advisory for the vulnerability, noting the affected versions of the jackson-databind package.
*   **NetApp Products:** Multiple NetApp products are affected by the vulnerability, including Active IQ Unified Manager and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage. NetApp has released a patch for the actively supported products.
*  **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `jackson-databind` versions updated to the latest patch release.
    *   Avoid using default typing if possible.
    *   Avoid using `java.lang.Object`, `java.util.Serializable` or `java.util.Comparable` as nominal types.
    *   Prefer using "type names" rather than class names for type identifiers.
    *   Disable automatic polymorphic type handling.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2020-11619 vulnerability is caused by the insecure handling of serialization gadgets when combined with polymorphic type handling in the `jackson-databind` library. Exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution and other attacks. The attacker requires network access, the ability to send JSON payloads, and knowledge of the specific class vulnerable for the target. Patches and mitigation steps are available from affected vendors.

**Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2020-11619, providing detailed information on the vulnerability and its impact.**
