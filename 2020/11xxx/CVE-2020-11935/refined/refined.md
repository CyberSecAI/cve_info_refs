{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The aufs filesystem calls i_readcount_inc() when opening a file in read-only mode, which is not paired with an i_readcount_dec(). This leads to an overflow of inode.i_readcount, which causes a BUG_ON() in i_readcount_dec() when the file is closed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect management of inode reference counts in the aufs file system",
      "Unpaired i_readcount_inc() call in read-only file operations within the aufs filesystem"
    ],
    "impact": "A kernel BUG() is triggered, which may turn into a kernel panic/crash if panic_on_oops is set. Otherwise, the system may log kernel messages and continue operation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to an aufs mount point",
      "Remote access via an application that accesses files on aufs mount points (e.g., a web server serving static content from aufs-backed storage)",
	  "Unprivileged local user repeatedly opening the same file in read-only mode on an aufs mount point"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user with read access to an aufs mount point and files inside it, or a remote attacker capable of triggering file access on an aufs mountpoint via an application such as a webserver. An attacker may also need a method to trigger the bug repeatedly, such as opening and closing the target file many times.",
	"additional_details": "The i_readcount is incremented on the real/underlying filesystem, not on the virtual aufs layer."
