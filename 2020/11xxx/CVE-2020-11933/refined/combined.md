# USN-4424-1: snapd vulnerabilities

15 July 2020

An intended access restriction in snapd could be bypassed by strict mode
snaps.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [snapd](/security/cves?package=snapd) - Daemon and tooling that enable snap packages

## Details

It was discovered that cloud-init as managed by snapd on Ubuntu Core 16 and

Ubuntu Core 18 devices ran on every boot without restrictions. A physical

attacker could exploit this to craft cloud-init user-data/meta-data via

external media to perform arbitrary changes on the device to bypass

intended security mechanisms such as full disk encryption. This issue did

not affect traditional Ubuntu systems. ([CVE-2020-11933](/security/CVE-2020-11933))

It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the XDG\_DATA\_DIRS

environment variable when calling the system xdg-open. A malicious snap

could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control how

the host system xdg-open script opens the URL. This issue did not affect

Ubuntu Core systems. ([CVE-2020-11934](/security/CVE-2020-11934))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 20.04

* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.45.1+20.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.45.1%2B20.04.2)

##### Ubuntu 19.10

* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.45.1+19.10.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.45.1%2B19.10.2)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.45.1+18.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.45.1%2B18.04.2)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.45.1ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.45.1ubuntu0.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

On Ubuntu, snapd will automatically refresh itself to snapd 2.45.2 which

is unaffected.

### Bug Description

On Ubuntu Core 18, cloud-init is configured to run w/o any restrictions. What this means is that you can craft cloud-init user-data/meta-data which creates users at any point in time during a device's lifetime by just attaching a flash drive and rebooting a device. I'm considering this a security bug as it totally bypasses any full disk encryption that we might have on Ubuntu Core 18 customers and is generally unexpected with Ubuntu Core 18.

I reproduced this with a flash drive formatted as vfat with label CIDATA, with the following files on it:

/user-data:

#cloud-config

users:

Â Â - default

Â Â - name: user1

Â Â Â Â sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Â Â Â Â lock\_passwd: false

Â Â Â Â passwd: $6$rounds=4096$ftDwPSSVP0Jq9$4hXIcusbcZMxbSnfv8D/vp/bdzgVAds9qGcFjeBvv1Ths9mLiNPKAxW8/1zOtGLPKsEcorUOzl16hn9jxswDz0

/meta-data:

instance-id: iid-local01

local-hostname: cloudimg

(the passwd hash is just "passw0rd")

With this flash drive, I can insert it and reboot a UC18 device at any point in it's lifetime, i.e. on first boot during seeding, or after seeding has completed and the device is connected to a brand store, etc. and upon booting up cloud-init will happily import this data and create the user as a sudoer, giving full root access to the device. Additionally, I can change the user-data / meta-data and reboot again (change user1 to user2 and instance-id to iid-local002, etc.) and cloud-init will happily re-import the data again. Arguably this is undesired behavior because it's expected to be able to use cloud-init to configure a device initially with a user/pw for various use-cases, but it's \_not\_ expected that after a device is seeded/setup/managed that cloud-init will run again creating new users.

I tested this with the released UC18 image on cdimage for Raspberry Pi 4 with the following snaps:

core18 20200427 1753 latest/stable canonicalâ base

pi 18-1 34 18-pi/stable canonicalâ gadget

pi-kernel 5.3.0-1023.25~18.04.1 135 18-pi/stable canonicalâ kernel

snapd 2.44.3 7267 latest/stable canonicalâ snapd

It's unclear how to fix this, but after discussing with Samuele and Michael, we probably want to just limit cloud-init to only run once on first-boot and then never again. This will allow current UC18 use cases for cloud-init such as testing or automated provisioning with MAAS to work, but will block attackers from adding new users at any point in time afterwards.

For reference, I tested this with a manually modified version of the core18 snap to not include the etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90\_dpkg.cfg file (which specifies to cloud-init it can use all possible data sources) and I could still reproduce this bug with Ubuntu Core 18.

Also verified that this bug affects Ubuntu Core 16 as well in the same way, tested with a flash drive labeled CIDATA like the bug description for Ubuntu Core 18. This time tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 running the released Ubuntu Core 16 images however since we don't have UC16 images for Raspberry Pi 4.

After some thinking the algorithm to disable cloud-int on seeded devices, is also the algorithm we want for UC20 in the few cases were we enable it explicitly there.

This is our thinking about how to lock down cloud-init after seeding, as designed there should be negligible risk for anything up and running and deployed, this might break some unusual factory or deployment processes, but there we should be able to deal with them on a case-by-case after the fact:

OK, here's my analysis of why this is happening:

At a high level, the issue is that cloud-init will mount and use an

available NoCloud drive on any boot[0]. If that drive includes a

changed instance ID in its metadata, then cloud-init will treat this as

a first instance boot and re-run every module: this means that all

configuration that is specified in the new NoCloud drive will be

applied. This is bad!

[0] This isn't \_exactly\_ true, as I'll discuss below.

More specifically, here is the sequence which causes this to happen:

\* cloud-init restores the NoCloud datasource instance from the previous

Â Â boot from its pickled form on disk:

Â Â <https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/f3bd42659efeed4b092ffcdfd5df7f24813f2d3e/cloudinit/stages.py#L215>

\* to ensure that this unpickled instance is still applicable for this

Â Â boot (an example of when it might not be applicable: if this instance

Â Â has been launched from an image that was captured from a

Â Â previously-booted instance), we call `ds.check\_instance\_id`:

Â Â <https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/f3bd42659efeed4b092ffcdfd5df7f24813f2d3e/cloudinit/stages.py#L230-L234>

\* we can see in the provided logs that the `else` is taken (search for

Â Â "cache invalid in datasource"), which means that cloud-init has

Â Â determined that the cached datasource object is no longer applicable

\* we can see why this happens by looking at NoCloud's implementation of

Â Â `check\_instance\_id`

Â Â (<https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/f3bd42659efeed4b092ffcdfd5df7f24813f2d3e/cloudinit/sources/DataSourceNoCloud.py#L209-L222> );

Â Â we only check the kernel command line and seed directories (i.e.

Â Â something in the instance's filesystem at one of

Â Â /var/lib/cloud/seed/nocloud{,-net}/); we will never detect a cached

Â Â instance ID if a NoCloud drive was the source of configuration

\* because the cache is invalid, cloud-init does its datasource

Â Â discovery process from scratch; it discovers the new NoCloud drive,

Â Â determines that the instance ID from this new drive does not match

Â Â the instance ID from the previous boot, and so assumes that this is

Â Â the first boot of a new instance. This means that it reads all the

Â Â configuration and performs all actions that aren't "per-once" (i.e.

Â Â it performs ~all of cloud-init's actions.)

subiquity installations are not vulnerable by default because the

installer writes the NoCloud configuration into /var/lib/cloud/seed,

cloud-init \_can\_ determine that the instance ID of the pickled

datasource is correct, and so it doesn't re-attempt datasource

discovery, and so doesn't even go looking for the attached NoCloud

drive. If you remove /var/lib/cloud/seed, then a subiquity

installation \_does\_ become vulnerable. (I have tested this.)

(I haven't tested this, but I assume that if the metadata is provided

on the kernel command line then, similarly, we won't run into the

issue.)

AIUI, 20.04 LTS Raspberry Pi images are similarly affected but do not include FDE. I've added a new Ubuntu cloud-init task and assigning Foundations.

@Foundations - there is a hardening opportunity for the 20.04 LTS Raspberry Pi images (ie, the CVE does not affect that product but we may want to update it and future products in a similar manner). I wasn't sure what package to assign this to so picked cloud-init. Please adjust as necessary. Also, we'll be making this bug public in a little while to give Ubuntu Core devices a chance to refresh.
