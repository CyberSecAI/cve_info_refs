Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `cloud-init` is managed by `snapd` on Ubuntu Core 16 and 18 devices. Specifically, `cloud-init` was running on every boot without restrictions. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious cloud-init user-data/meta-data via external media, like a USB drive, and cause arbitrary changes on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Cloud-Init Execution:** `cloud-init` was not limited to first boot and could be triggered repeatedly on subsequent boots.
*   **Bypass of Intended Security Mechanisms:** The ability to inject malicious cloud-init data bypassed security mechanisms such as full disk encryption.
*   **No Instance ID Check:** `cloud-init` did not properly validate the instance ID when using a NoCloud datasource, allowing it to re-run all configuration if a different instance ID was provided. Specifically, the check for the instance ID was limited to the kernel command line and seed directories, not detecting changes when a new NoCloud drive was connected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to:

*   **Create Arbitrary Users:** An attacker can create new administrative users (with `sudo` access) on the device at any time.
*   **Gain Full Root Access:**  By adding a user with `sudo` privileges, the attacker can gain full root access to the device.
*   **Modify System Configuration:** The attacker can make arbitrary changes to the system configuration.
*   **Bypass Full Disk Encryption:** Since the vulnerability occurs before disk encryption is fully active, it effectively bypasses this security measure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the target device to insert a USB drive or other external media.
*   **External Media (USB):** The attack is initiated by inserting a specially crafted USB drive (or other external media) containing malicious `cloud-init` user-data/meta-data.
*   **Reboot:** The device needs to be rebooted after the malicious media is attached to trigger `cloud-init` with the new configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access to the Device:** An attacker must be able to physically connect a USB drive or other external media to the target system.
*   **Ability to Create Cloud-Init Configurations:** The attacker must be able to create properly formatted `cloud-init` user-data and meta-data files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Ubuntu Core 16 and 18 devices, and it does *not* affect traditional Ubuntu systems.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in `snapd` version 2.45.2.
*   The fix involves limiting `cloud-init` to only run once on first boot.
*   Subiquity installations are not vulnerable by default, because the installer writes the NoCloud configuration into `/var/lib/cloud/seed`, preventing `cloud-init` from re-attempting datasource discovery from the attached drive, unless the seed directory is removed.
*   The vulnerability also affects 20.04 LTS Raspberry Pi images but these images do not have FDE.
