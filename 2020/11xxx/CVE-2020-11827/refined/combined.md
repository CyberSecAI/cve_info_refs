## FAQ

* ### What is GOG GALAXY 2.0 and why should I use it?

  GOG GALAXY 2.0 is an application, thanks to which you’ll be able to combine multiple libraries into one and connect with your friends across all gaming platforms, consoles included. If your games and gaming buddies are scattered between different launchers and platforms, this is a solution for you! Keeping track of all achievements earned by you and your friends, hours played, and games owned across platforms has never been this easy. And the application is entirely free, all you need is a GOG account to use it.
* ### How can I add my games to GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  In GOG GALAXY 2.0 you’re adding games through official and community created integrations. By connecting platforms, the data about the games you own is automatically imported to the application. On top of that you are also able to manually add single games even if they are not connected to any platform.
* ### Will GOG GALAXY 2.0 show all my games, or only those I have installed on my PC?

  Yes, GOG GALAXY 2.0 will show all your games from connected PC and console platforms… even if they are not currently installed.
* ### Do I still need to have other gaming clients installed on my PC?

  Yes, if you want to get access to any features specific to that platform, e.g. installing or auto-updating games, cloud saves, etc.
* ### Will I be able to customize my games library?

  Yes, our goal is to provide you with the most options possible to customize your games library. In GOG GALAXY 2.0, you’ll be able to create your own views based on different filters available in the app, tags that you’ll create on your own, and search queries you’ll come up with. Mix and match all of those options to create countless library views. Once you do, save them for quick access and automatic synchronization. On top of that, you can also manually edit the metadata of every game in your master games collection.
* ### How can I add my friends to GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  Like with games, in GOG GALAXY 2.0 adding friends begins with connecting platforms. By doing so, you can find other GOG GALAXY users who are your friends on the platforms or social networks you have connected.

  Additionally, you’ll be able to see non-GOG GALAXY users from friends lists of connected platforms – with an option to check their online status and chat with them cross-platform.
* ### What kind of stats and activities will GOG GALAXY 2.0 show me?

  You’ll see all your games from connected platforms together with your progress in each title – achievements you’ve earned and your game time. Also, for your GOG GALAXY friends, you’ll be able to see their online status and what games they are playing, with their achievements and time spent in each title.
* ### Will GOG GALAXY 2.0 spy on my computer?

  No. We’re not in the business of users’ data. GOG GALAXY 2.0 is only importing information from connected platforms – you always know what is imported through official integrations. Additionally we’ve made the community created integrations open-source, to ensure the transparency of imported data.

* ### What data does GOG GALAXY 2.0 share with other platforms?

  We don’t share any data with third parties.
* ### How can I delete my data from GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  Once you have disconnected a platform from GOG GALAXY 2.0, we will remove all your imported data from our servers.
* ### What are the community created integrations and how I can create one?

  We want to offer integrations with all possible gaming platforms. This is a challenging and time-consuming process, not only because these are technically complex projects, but they also require negotiations and agreements with partners. We want all our official integrations to be supported by respective platform holders, so we make sure they’re in-line with partners’ policies and that they’re safe.

  While we’re hard at work on adding more official integrations, we’ve decided to give you – the community – an opportunity to work on your own open source platform integrations. The documentation about how to build your own GOG GALAXY 2.0 integrations for various gaming platforms can be found [here](https://github.com/gogcom/galaxy-integrations-python-api).
* ### I’m a GOG.COM user, what’s new for me in GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  The whole client has been rebuilt from the ground up to be better and faster. All features for third party platforms work for GOG.COM. With the new games library, you’ll be able to filter, sort and add tags to customize your views and save them for easy access. Thanks to the new friends section, you’ll have a chance to track your friends progress in every GOG.COM game, as well as see what they are currently playing. On top of that, GOG GALAXY 2.0 will remain your optional client for GOG.COM games – features like auto-updates, cloud saves, cross-play, rollbacks and more stay the same as the GOG GALAXY you’re currently using. Once we include all features available in the current version of GOG GALAXY client to the 2.0 version, we will update everyone to the GOG GALAXY 2.0 application.
* ### How can I participate in the Open Beta?

  The Open Beta is already available and everybody is welcome to participate in it. To get access to GOG GALAXY 2.0 download the installer from www.gogalaxy.com. Once dowloaded, launch it and follow the instructions. GOG account and consent to GOG GALAXY 2.0 EULA are required to participate in the test. The GOG account is entirely free.
* ### I found a bug in GOG GALAXY 2.0, how can I report it?

  There is an "Report an issue" option in the app under settings icon. We also encourage you to tell us what you think about GOG GALAXY 2.0 via the "Share feedback" option, in the same settings menu.
* ### I’m a journalist/content creator and would like to get in touch with you, how I can contact you?

  Drop us an email at pr@gog.com and we’ll get back to you!
