| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1835793#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-05-14 13:54:15 UTC  ``` libEMF (aka ECMA-234 Metafile Library) through 1.0.11 allows a use-after-free.  Reference: <https://sourceforge.net/p/libemf/news/2020/05/re-release-of-libemf-1012/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1835793#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-05-14 13:54:32 UTC  ``` Created libEMF tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1835794](show_bug.cgi?id=1835794 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-11866 libEMF: allows a use-after-free [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1835793#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-05-27 05:36:16 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://sourceforge.net/p/libemf/news/2020/05/re-release-of-libemf-1012/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1835793#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-05-27 05:41:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based on ECMA-234. The general purpose of this library is to create vector graphics files on POSIX systems which can be imported into OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice. Programs compiled with libEMF, output ECMA-234 graphics files locally which can be then imported into desktop applications. Therefore this use-after-free flaw can only be triggered via maliciously written applications compiled with libEMF.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1835793#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-05-27 05:43:54 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <https://sourceforge.net/p/libemf/code/92/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1835793#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-05-27 11:20:31 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-11866>   ``` |  |

FEDORA-2020-c696d8604b
2020-05-27 03:01:29.403149
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libEMF
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.0.12
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://libemf.sourceforge.net/>
Summary : A library for generating Enhanced Metafiles
Description :
libEMF is a library for generating Enhanced Metafiles on systems which
don't natively support the ECMA-234 Graphics Device Interface
(GDI). The library is intended to be used as a driver for other
graphics programs such as Grace or gnuplot. Therefore, it implements a
very limited subset of the GDI.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1835797#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-05-14 13:58:10 UTC  ``` libEMF (aka ECMA-234 Metafile Library) through 1.0.11 allows denial of service (issue 1 of 2).  Reference: <https://sourceforge.net/p/libemf/news/2020/05/re-release-of-libemf-1012/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1835797#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-05-14 13:58:43 UTC  ``` Created libEMF tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1835798](show_bug.cgi?id=1835798 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-11863 libEMF: allows denial of service (issue 1 of 2) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1835797#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-06-01 05:21:19 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://sourceforge.net/p/libemf/news/2020/05/re-release-of-libemf-1012/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1835797#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-06-01 05:32:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based on ECMA-234. The general purpose of this library is to create vector graphics files on POSIX systems which can be imported into OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice. Programs compiled with libEMF, output ECMA-234 graphics files locally which can be then imported into desktop applications. Therefore this denial-of-service flaw can only be triggered via maliciously written applications compiled with libEMF.   ``` |  |
