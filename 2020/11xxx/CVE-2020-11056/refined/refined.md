    "summary": "The provided content relates to CVE-2020-11056. It describes a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in the barrelstrength/sprout-base-email package, which is part of Sprout Forms. This vulnerability allows the execution of Twig code due to the way custom fields were handled in notification emails. The issue was fixed in barrelstrength/sprout-forms:v3.9.0 which upgrades barrelstrength/sprout-base-email to v1.2.7.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way custom fields are handled in notification emails, specifically within the `barrelstrength/sprout-base-email` package, which allows for the execution of Twig code.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary Twig code, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating custom form fields in a way that injects malicious Twig code, which is then executed when the notification email is rendered.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to submit a form that includes custom field values containing the malicious Twig code. This does not explicitly require administrative access, but could be leveraged if an admin creates an email template. The attacker would need to be able to trigger the email notification."
