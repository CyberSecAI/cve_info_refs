{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Qualcomm's Snapdragon DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chip due to issues in the Hexagon SDK (Software Development Kit) and lack of proper input validation in skeleton libraries and QDI (QuRT Driver Invocation) drivers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of version control for DSP libraries: Allows loading older, vulnerable versions of libraries, bypassing patches.",
      "Bugs in Hexagon SDK: Automatically generated code for stub and skeleton libraries introduces vulnerabilities such as incorrect handling of string and buffer arguments (e.g., type casting to signed int for length checks, leading to heap overflows).",
       "Missing input validation in skeleton libraries: Vulnerabilities arise from improper checks and usage of arguments passed from the CPU to the DSP.",
       "Lack of sufficient access control:  Any app can potentially access and load arbitrary DSP libraries. ",
      "Insecure QDI drivers: QDI drivers have vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary kernel read and write, and code execution vulnerabilities exist."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation can lead to:\n    - Turning the phone into a spying tool (exfiltration of photos, videos, call recordings, microphone data, GPS location).\n    - Rendering the phone unresponsive (denial-of-service).\n    - Hiding malware and malicious code.\n    - Triggering DSP kernel panics and device reboots.\n    - Executing arbitrary code on the DSP, potentially escalating to the Guest OS and kernel.\n    - Accessing DSP kernel drivers to expand privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by:\n    -  Crafting malicious Android applications to directly invoke DSP methods by skipping the stub code using the functions `remote_handle_open` and `remote_handle_invoke`.\n    - Utilizing a crafted input file to trigger vulnerabilities within the DSP libraries and drivers via a custom program.\n    - Exploiting the lack of version control to downgrade to older library versions with known vulnerabilities by manipulating the `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers require the ability to:\n    - Install a malicious application on an affected Android device.\n    -  Bypass standard security mechanisms to directly interact with the DSP.\n    - Knowledge of vulnerable DSP libraries and their methods as well as access to a vulnerable version of the DSP library.\n    - Ability to reverse-engineer the DSP firmware to find the vulnerable methods and their parameters.\n   - The attacker needs to gain access to the DSP's user domain."
