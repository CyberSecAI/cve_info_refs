This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router, gateway, and WiFi system models. However, this is not related to CVE-2020-11787.

Root cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of user input leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored XSS vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected devices. When a user accesses this interface, the injected script will execute within the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
   - Steal session cookies.
   - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
   - Redirect the user to a malicious website.
   - Deface the web interface.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious script into input fields that are then stored by the device and displayed to other users.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected device. Specific access requirements are not provided, but this usually means the attacker needs access to a vulnerable page or interface.
