Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-11616:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the AMI BMC firmware used in NVIDIA DGX servers. The Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithm within the JSOL package, which implements the IPMI protocol, is not cryptographically strong.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - The PRNG used is not cryptographically secure. This can lead to predictable outputs from the PRNG.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Information Disclosure: An attacker may be able to predict generated values, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
  - Network-adjacent: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability.
  - Complex Attack: The attack is complex, indicating that exploiting this weakness is not straightforward.
  - User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction, likely meaning a user must perform an action for the attack to succeed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker must be on the same network segment as the target BMC.
  - The attacker needs to be able to initiate a network interaction with the IPMI interface of the server.
  - The attacker has to induce the user to perform actions that trigger the PRNG weakness.

**CVSS v3.1 Score:** 2.9
**CVSS Vector:** AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Affected Products:**
   - NVIDIA DGX-1 servers with BMC firmware versions prior to 3.38.30

**Mitigation:**
  - Upgrade the BMC firmware to version 3.38.30 or later.
