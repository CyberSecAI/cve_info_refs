CVE-2020-11420

Summary

ABB is aware of public reports of a vulnerability in the product versions listed above. An update is availa-
ble that resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the product versions listed above.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability is allowed to read arbitrary files from the af-
fected product including application, credentials and operating system files.

Vulnerability Severity

The severity assessment has been performed by using the FIRST Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) v3.1. The CVSS Environmental Score, which can affect the vulnerability severity, is not provided in
this advisory since it reflects the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’
computing environment; end-user organizations are therefore recommended to analyze their situation
and specify the Environmental Score.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score:

6.5 (Medium)

CVSS v3.1 Temporal Score:  6.0 (Medium)

CVSS v3.1 Vector:

AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C

Vulnerability Details

CYB ERS ECURI T Y  ADV IS O RY

A vulnerability exists in the UPS Adapter CS141 included in the product versions listed above. An attacker
with Admin or Engineer login credentials could exploit the vulnerability by manipulating variables that
reference files and by doing this achieve access to files and directories outside the web root folder. An
attacker may access arbitrary files and directories stored in the file system, but integrity of the files are
not jeopardized as attacker have read access rights only. This attack is commonly known as Path
Traversal or Directory Traversal.

Mitigating Factors

Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network
from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control sys-
tems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections
to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal
number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems
should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and
removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control
system.

This vulnerability can only be exploited if attacker knows the Admin or Engineer login password. A good
practice to make an attack that exploits this vulnerability more difficult is to change all default pass-
words as default passwords are easy to find and often used by attackers.

Workarounds

ABB has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying
vulnerability, they can help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, this is
identified below as “Impact of workaround”.

•  Change all default passwords to prevent attacker from login to system using default passwords.

Impact of workaround - No functionality is reduced

•  Protect the process control network from attacks that originate outside by blocking HTTP (port
80) and HTTPS (port 443) in firewall that separates process control network from another net-
work.

Impact of workaround - Remote monitoring service will not be available as user cannot connect
to web server outside process control network.

Frequently Asked Questions

What is the scope of the vulnerability?

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read arbitrary files and directories from
the UPS Adapter CS141.

What causes the vulnerability?

The vulnerability is caused by unchecked input data in UPS adapter CS141.

What is the UPS Adapter CS141?

CYB ERS ECURI T Y  ADV IS O RY

The affected product is different variants of the UPS Adapter CS141. These cards are used to monitor
the UPS status (measures and states) and can also send automatic notification based on configured
events (via email or SNMP traps). Having standard protocols (i.e. Modbus and SNMP) allows the user to
integrate the UPS in the Building Monitoring System (BMS).

What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files
including credential files. An important aspect is that all credential files are encrypted. This means that
an attacker that successfully reads out a password file will have to decrypt the file before being able to
read the password in clear text.

How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by manipulating variables that reference files and then
possibly achieve read access to files and directories outside the web root folder. This would require that
the attacker has access to the system network, by connecting to the network either directly or through a
wrongly configured or penetrated firewall, or that he installs malicious software on a system node or
otherwise infects the network with malicious software. This would also require that the attacker is able
to login as either Admin or Engineer prior to trying to exploit this vulnerability. This can be achieved if
attacker know the login credentials or manages to break the authentication. Recommended practices
help mitigate such attacks, see section Mitigating Factors above.

Could the vulnerability be exploited remotely?

Yes, an attacker who has network access to an affected system node could exploit this vulnerability. Rec-
ommended practices include that process control systems are physically protected, have no direct con-
nections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a
minimal number of ports exposed.

What does the update do?

 The update eliminates the vulnerability by adding an input control of the requested resources, allowing
only requests of predefined files (i.e. events log) and disallowing any other request.

When this security advisory was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly
disclosed?

No, ABB received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

When this security advisory was issued, had ABB received any reports that this
vulnerability was being exploited?

No, ABB had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been exploited when this
security advisory was originally issued.
