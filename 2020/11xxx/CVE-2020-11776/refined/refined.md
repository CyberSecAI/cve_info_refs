The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0524, affecting several router and gateway models. However, it does NOT relate to CVE-2020-11776.

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability present in the firmware of the listed Netgear router and gateway models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a website or web application that are then stored and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the router's web interface
    - Theft of sensitive information (e.g., login credentials)
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other forms of unauthorized actions within the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via the web interface of the affected router or gateway.
- An attacker would likely inject malicious scripts into a field or parameter that is later displayed to other users who access the router's web interface. This usually involves a web interface input field that fails to properly sanitize user supplied input before displaying it again on the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with a vulnerable input on the router's web interface to inject the malicious script. The user will likely need to be logged in to the device's administration panel in order to perform this injection.
- In the provided CVSS vector string the 'PR:H' field (Privileges Required) indicates High privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Models and Firmware Versions:**
The advisory lists the following affected models and their vulnerable firmware versions:
    - D7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
    - R7500v2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
    - R7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.68
    - R8900, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
    - R9000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.28
    - RAX120, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.78
    - XR500, firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.56
    - XR700, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.10

**Mitigation:**
- The primary mitigation is to update the firmware of the affected Netgear router or gateway to the latest version available from the Netgear support website.
