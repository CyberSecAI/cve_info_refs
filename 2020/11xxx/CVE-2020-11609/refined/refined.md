Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed by the identified commits:

**1. CVE-2020-11609**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `stv06xx` driver, specifically in the `stv06xx.c` and `stv06xx_pb0100.c` files, was not properly validating USB device descriptors. The driver would attempt to access members of the altsetting structure or endpoint arrays without ensuring they existed, potentially leading to null pointer dereferences.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The main weakness was the lack of sanity checks before dereferencing the pointers leading to NULL pointer dereferences.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (crash) due to the null pointer dereference.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A physically present user could use a specially crafted USB device with malformed descriptors to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs physical access to the system and ability to plug in a malicious USB device.

**2. CVE-2020-12652**

The information suggests that multiple drivers and subsystems within the Linux kernel have vulnerabilities, primarily related to missing input validation or synchronization issues. The impact of these vulnerabilities ranged from denial-of-service (crashes) and resource exhaustion to local privilege escalation and information disclosure. An attacker generally needs local access, or the ability to plug in specific types of crafted devices, or the ability to send specific types of requests or network traffic to exploit them. Some of the vulnerabilities can be triggered from remote access when they involve network drivers or by manipulating parameters sent across the network. Additionally, microcode updates were recommended for the CVE-2020-0543 vulnerability.
