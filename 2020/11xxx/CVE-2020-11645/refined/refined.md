- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in the GateManager Ping feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The Ping feature can cause a GateManager instance to restart.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can repeatedly trigger a restart of GateManager instances, limiting their availability, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the GateManager instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user.
