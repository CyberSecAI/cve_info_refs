  "CVE-2020-11526": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `update_recv_secondary_order` function within `libfreerdp/core/orders.c` of FreeRDP. This occurs because the `next` pointer is calculated based on a user-controlled `orderLength`. When `orderLength` is oversized, this can cause a subsequent integer overflow within `Stream_GetRemainingLength`, leading to a failure in checks and an out-of-bounds read. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious RDP server sending crafted order segments.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `Stream_GetRemainingLength` due to an oversized `orderLength` provided by a malicious RDP server.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read due to incorrect pointer arithmetic and insufficient bounds checking.",
      "Integer overflow vulnerability in `Stream_GetRemainingLength` function."
     ],
    "impact": "Out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to denial of service or information disclosure.  The client could crash or leak data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious RDP server sending crafted order segments with an oversized `orderLength`.",
      "By repeatedly calling the `update_recv_order` function with a carefully crafted sequence of order segments. The crafted sequence causes the stream pointer to move outside the buffer, which is later used by other functions that incorrectly assume that the stream pointer is still within the valid range."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to act as an RDP server and send crafted RDP messages to the client. The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or man-in-the-middle the RDP connection or control the remote server being connected to.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs specifically when processing secondary order segments. The `orderLength` is read from the stream and added to the current position of the stream pointer. If the resulting pointer is outside the bounds of the buffer, a later bounds check fails because of an integer overflow.",
    "fixed_version": "2.0.0"
