CA20200414-01: Security Notice for CA API Developer Portal

Issued: April 14th, 2020
Last Updated: April 14th, 2020

CA Technologies, A Broadcom Company, is alerting customers to multiple
vulnerabilities in CA API Developer Portal. Multiple vulnerabilities
exist that can allow attackers to bypass access controls, view or
modify sensitive information, perform open redirect attacks, or
elevate privileges. CA published solutions to address these
vulnerabilities and recommends that all affected customers implement
these solutions.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2020-11658, occurs due insecure handling
of shared secret keys. An attacker can bypass authorization.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2020-11659, occurs due to an access
control flaw. A privileged user can perform a restricted user
administration action.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2020-11660, occurs due to an access
control flaw. A privileged user can view restricted sensitive
information.

The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2020-11661, occurs due to an access
control flaw. A privileged user can view and edit user data.

The fifth vulnerability, CVE-2020-11662, occurs due to insecure
request handling. A remote attacker can exploit Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing to access sensitive information.

The sixth vulnerability, CVE-2020-11663, occurs due to insecure
redirect handling of 404 requests. An attacker can perform open
redirect attacks.

The seventh vulnerability, CVE-2020-11664, occurs due to insecure
redirect handling in the homeRedirect page. An attacker can perform
open redirect attacks.

The eighth vulnerability, CVE-2020-11665, occurs due to insecure
redirect handling in the loginRedirect page. An attacker can perform
open redirect attacks.
