Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11103:

**CVE-2020-11103:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is described as a "Webswing JsLink Mechanism Remote Code Execution Vulnerability". This indicates that the vulnerability lies within the way Webswing handles Javascript links or interactions. It suggests a mechanism where the server interprets or processes javascript code sent from the client.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is a failure to properly sanitize or validate the JavaScript code sent via the "JsLink Mechanism". This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that the server then executes.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the Webswing application. This means an attacker could gain complete control over the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of system files, and potentially launching further attacks on the internal network.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector would involve crafting a malicious JavaScript payload and sending it to the vulnerable Webswing instance via the "JsLink Mechanism." The specific way to exploit this would likely depend on the specifics of the implementation, but would involve leveraging a client-side functionality.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Webswing server.
    *   The attacker likely needs to be able to interact with the Webswing application interface in some capacity, as this is where the "JsLink" mechanism is likely being utilized. Specific access would depend on how the vulnerability is used.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-11103 is a critical vulnerability, allowing for Remote Code Execution through the Webswing "JsLink Mechanism". This vulnerability is due to improper input sanitization which enables malicious JavaScript injection and subsequent execution on the server-side.
