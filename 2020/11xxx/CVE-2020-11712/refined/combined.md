[![homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/cve/master/xss.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/cve/master/xss.png)

There is two way to exploit it:

1. Send Link to your uploaded file to admin by email for exemple
2. let admin navigate himself into `http://localhost/index.php?action=adminfiles`

In both cases, your payload will be executed.
