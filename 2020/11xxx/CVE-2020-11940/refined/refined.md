{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of the `offset` variable within the `concat_hash_string` function of the nDPI SSH dissector.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds read and heap overflow vulnerabilities.",
      "Lack of bounds checks on the `offset` variable after integer arithmetic operations.",
      "Unchecked increment of `buf_out_len` leading to heap overflow.",
    ],
    "impact": "Out-of-bounds read may result in Denial of Service (DoS). The heap overflow vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted SSH KEXINIT (type: 20) packet, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow and out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities during the parsing of string data.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted SSH packets to a system using the vulnerable nDPI library."
