Details:
=======
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in ManageEngineADSelfService
Plus Software when it does not properly enforce user privileges associated
with Windows Certificate Dialog.

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely
execute commands with system level privileges on target windows host.An
attacker does not require any privilege on the target system in order to
exploit this vulnerability.

ManageEngineADSelfService Plus thick client enables a user to perform
self-service like password reset, self-service account unlock, etc by using
self-service option on windows login screen.

Upon selecting this option, ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus thick client
software will be launched which will connect to a remote ADSelfServicePlus
server to facilitate the self-service operations.

A security alert can/will be triggered when “an unauthenticated attacker
having physical access to the host issues a self-signed SSLcertificate to
the client”. Or, “a (default) self-signed SSLcertificate is configured on
ADSelfService Plus server”.

“ViewCertificate” option from the security alert will allow an attacker
with physical access or a remote attacker with RDP access, to export a
displayed certificate to a file. This will further cascade to the standard
dialog/wizard which will open file explorer as SYSTEM.

By navigating file explorer through “C:\windows\system32\”, acmd.exe can be
launched as a SYSTEM.

Vendor link: https://www.manageengine.com/company.html

Vulnerable Product:
==============
ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus is an integrated self-service password
management and single sign on solution. This solution helps domain users
perform self-service password reset, self-service account unlock, employee
self-update of personal details (e.g., mobile numbers and photos) in
Microsoft Windows Active Directory. ADSelfService Plus also provides users
with secure, one-click access to all SAML-supported enterprise
applications, including Office 365, Salesforce, and G Suite, through Active
Directory-based single sign-on (SSO). For improved security, ADSelfService
Plus offers Windows two-factor authentication for all remote and local
logins. Administrators find it easy to automate password resets, account
unlocks while optimizing IT expenses associated with help desk calls.

Abstract:
=======
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in ManageEngine ADSelfService
Plus Software when it does not properly enforce user privileges associated
with Windows Certificate Dialog.
This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely
execute commands with system level privileges on target windows host. An
attacker does not require any privilege on the target system in order to
exploit this vulnerability.

Affected Software Version:
=============
< ADSelfService Plus build 6003

Exploitation-Technique:
===================
Remote

Severity Rating (CVSS):
===================
9.8 (Critical) (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Details:
=======
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in ManageEngine ADSelfService
Plus Software when it does not properly enforce user privileges associated
with Windows Certificate Dialog.

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely
execute commands with system level privileges on target windows host. An
attacker does not require any privilege on the target system in order to
exploit this vulnerability.

ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus thick client enables a user to perform
self-service like password reset, self-service account unlock, etc by using
self-service option on windows login screen.

Upon selecting this option, ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus thick client
software will be launched which will connect to a remote ADSelfServicePlus
server to facilitate the self-service operations.

A security alert can/will be triggered when “an unauthenticated attacker
having physical access to the host issues a self-signed SSL certificate to
the client”. Or, “a (default) self-signed SSL certificate is configured on
ADSelfService Plus server”.

“View Certificate” option from the security alert will allow an attacker
with physical access or a remote attacker with RDP access, to export a
displayed certificate to a file. This will further cascade to the standard
dialog/wizard which will open file explorer as SYSTEM.

By navigating file explorer through “C:\windows\system32\”, a cmd.exe can
be launched as a SYSTEM.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### ManageEngineâs Take on Control

If you were looking for IT management solutions in 2001, you faced a market dominated by the âBig 4â vendors whose software was high priced, hard to deploy, and harder to use. Even a simple evaluation exposed you to an extended engagement with enterprise sales reps. Subsequent deployments required costly consultants to get the solutions up and running and get your IT team acquainted with the UIs and workflows. In short, you danced to the tune of the Big 4. They were in control, not you. And that meant you needed deep pockets, deep pools of talent, and plenty of time if you wanted the advantages of well-managed IT.

That was the IT management market circa 2001. And thatâs the market we turned upside down, guided by corporate and product philosophies that ultimately empower you to control your IT on your terms.
