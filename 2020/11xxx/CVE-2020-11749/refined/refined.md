Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11749

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in various parts of the PandoraFMS web application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in PandoraFMS 7.0 NG versions up to 746. These include both:
    - Reflected XSS:  Where the malicious script is part of the request and is reflected back in the response.
    - Stored XSS: Where the malicious script is stored within the application database and is served to users upon access to the affected area.

Specifically, the identified vulnerable areas are:
   1. **SNMP Browser:** The `syscontact`, `syslocation`, `sysname` and `sysDesc` fields of an SNMP device scan can be manipulated to include Javascript code, which will execute when browsing the SNMP device within PandoraFMS's SNMP Browser.
   2.  **Network Scan:** The input fields in Discovery > Host & Devices > Network Scan are vulnerable to reflected XSS.
   3.  **Visual Styles:** Custom value post-processing 'text' input and module units 'Value' input are vulnerable to stored XSS.
   4.  **Profiles > Modules Tags > Create Tag:** The email input tab is vulnerable to stored XSS.
   5.  **System Logfiles:** The server log directory can be manipulated to store malicious code in the system logs, leading to stored XSS when accessing Pandora FMS's system log view.
   6.  **Manage Agent Group:** Stored XSS occurs when hovering over icons in Manage Agent Group.
   7.  **Network Map:** Stored XSS is triggered when creating a network map with malicious inputs and later accessing the network map.
   8.  **View Events:** Stored XSS occurs within the comments area of events.
   9.  **List of special day:** Stored XSS occurs when creating special days with malicious inputs and hovering over the special day in the list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to:
   - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
   - Potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim.
   - Steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
   - Gain complete remote code execution (RCE) via a crafted javascript that uses the vulnerability to create malicious plugins and subsequently execute them.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors include:
   - Manipulating SNMP device data to inject JavaScript within the SNMP browser feature.
   - Directly entering malicious scripts into vulnerable input fields of the web interface.
   - Tricking an administrator to perform a network scan with a manipulated input.
   - Storing malicious script within the configuration database by using vulnerable input fields, which is then triggered on subsequent visits.
   - By loading a remote javascript, a reverse shell can be opened on a vulnerable instance by a remote attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send SNMP requests to a target device or control an SNMP device to manipulate its data.
   - The attacker needs to have access to the PandoraFMS web interface (authentication is required for some of the attack vectors)
   - The attacker needs to be able to trick a PandoraFMS administrator to perform actions that trigger the XSS (like performing a network scan).
   - The attacker needs to be able to host a remote javascript file.

**Additional Information:**
   - The exploit-db entry provides a working proof-of-concept (PoC) that details the steps to achieve RCE through a combination of XSS and plugin creation.
   - The medium.com article outlines the multiple XSS vulnerabilities that have been patched in release 747.
   - The PandoraFMS release notes for version 747 mention that multiple XSS issues were resolved thanks to the information provided by @tehwinsam.
   - PandoraFMS 7.0 NG versions up to 746 are vulnerable, while version 747 has the fixes applied.
