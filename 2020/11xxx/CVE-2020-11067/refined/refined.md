Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11067:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure deserialization of backend user settings stored in `$BE_USER->uc`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the insecure deserialization process, which allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized data.
- This vulnerability exists within the TYPO3 CMS core.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), especially when combined with vulnerabilities in third-party components.
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- The impact is rated as high, with the potential for significant compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- A low-complexity attack can be executed (AC:L)
- The attack requires a valid backend user account (PR:L).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid backend user account on the TYPO3 instance.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted request to the backend with malicious serialized data within user settings.
