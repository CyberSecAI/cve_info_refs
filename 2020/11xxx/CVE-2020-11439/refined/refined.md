  "CVE-2020-11439": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the `url` parameter of the `librehealthehr/interface/main/tabs/main.php` endpoint. This allows the execution of arbitrary PHP files within the LibreHealth EHR application's web root. The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `url` parameter in the `main.php` endpoint, allowing an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server. An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file and then use the LFI vulnerability to execute it, gaining control of the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `url` parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires an attacker to be an authenticated user of the application. The attacker also needs to have a way to upload the malicious PHP code (in this case, using another CVE).",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability can be chained with an insecure file upload vulnerability to achieve remote code execution. The exploit chain includes uploading a PHP webshell, and then using the LFI vulnerability to execute the uploaded shell."

        "related": true,
        "summary": "The `note` parameter of the `/librehealthehr/controller.php` endpoint is vulnerable to stored XSS, exploitable from a low-privileged user. A proof-of-concept XSS payload caused server-side code execution when a user navigated to the affected endpoint.",
        "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `note` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

        "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the user's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or privilege escalation if chained with other vulnerabilities.",

            "Remote exploitation through an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `note` parameter containing malicious JavaScript."

         "attacker_capabilities": "Requires an attacker to be an authenticated low-privileged user of the application. The attacker then needs to convince a victim user to visit a page that displays the stored XSS payload.",
         "additional_details": "The XSS vulnerability is stored, meaning the injected payload will execute every time a user views the affected document note. It can also be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve server-side code execution."

  "CVE-2020-11437": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The `letter.php` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `form_from` and `form_to` POST parameters. This can lead to sensitive data disclosure.",
    "root_cause": "Unsafe SQL string building in the `interface/patient_file/letter.php` source code, where user-supplied data in the `form_from` and `form_to` parameters is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"

 "CVE-2020-11438": {
      "related": true,
      "summary": "The LibreHealth EHR application is affected by systemic CSRF which allows POST requests to be sent from arbitrary origins. This can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.",

        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"

       "additional_details": "The CSRF vulnerability can be chained with a known insecure file upload vulnerability to gain remote code execution. The phishing page was tested with a null origin.  User creation/modification requests require an admin user password, and are not vulnerable to CSRF."

  "Vulnerable Software": {
    "related": true,
        "summary": "The LibreHealth EHR application is affected by vulnerable software because it is a form of an older OpenEMR version code base that contained known, un-remediated vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities included multiple high-risk issues including PHP code injection, command injection, file path traversal, and XSS.",
