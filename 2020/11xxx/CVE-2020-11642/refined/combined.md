Vulnerability Details

CVE-2020-11641 SiteManager Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Description

SiteManager contains a Web application powering the Web GUI used to manage a SiteManager
instance. This Web application allows to read sensitive files located on a SiteManager instance.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can read service configuration and other sensitive information, potentially
abusing this information for malicious activities on SiteManager instances.

Fix

The Web application now denies to read local files from a SiteManager instance.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has not identified any specific workarounds or mitigations for this vulnerability.
Security solutions like Intrusion Prevention Systems and Web Application Firewalls may be able to
prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by blocking exploit traffic before it reaches SiteManager
instances. Further details are provided in our Cyber Security guidelines – see section "Supporting
information and guidelines" below.

CVE-2020-11642 SiteManager Denial of Service via Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Description

Abusing the Local File Inclusion Vulnerability outlined above may cause SiteManager instances to restart.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can repeatedly trigger a restart of SiteManager instances, thus limiting their
availability.

Fix

This vulnerability is a consequence of the Local File Inclusion Vulnerability - the fix for the Local File
Inclusion Vulnerability also fixes this vulnerability.

Workarounds and Mitigations

This vulnerability is a consequence of the Local File Inclusion Vulnerability – please check the respective
section of the parent vulnerability "CVE-2020-11641 SiteManager Local File Inclusion Vulnerability".

Description

On GateManager instances serving multiple, independent organizations, a vulnerability in the audit log
feature allows cross-domain access to information of foreign devices.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can gather information about devices belonging to a foreign organization,
potentially abusing this information for malicious activities.

Fix

The audit log code now prevents cross-domain access to device information.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has not identified any specific workarounds or mitigations for this vulnerability.

CVE-2020-11644 GateManager Audit Message Spoofing Vulnerability

Description

A vulnerability in the GateManager audit log feature may be abused to generate fake audit
messages/alerts.

Impact

An authenticated adversary can fool users of foreign domains with fictional audit messages/alerts of their
choice.

Fix

The audit log code no longer allows a user to write fictional audit messages/alerts to the audit log.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R has not identified any specific workarounds or mitigations for this vulnerability.

CVE-2020-11645 GateManager Denial of Service Vulnerability

Description

A vulnerability in the GateManager Ping feature may cause a GateManager instance to restart.

Impact

## 4. MITIGATIONS

B&R Industrial Automation reports the vulnerabilities have been fixed in the following versions:

* SiteManager v9.2.620236042
* GateManager 4260 and 9250 v9.0.20262
* GateManager 8250 v9.2.620236042

The B&R cybersecurity webpage provides further information including [cybersecurity guidelines](https://www.br-automation.com/en/service/cyber-security/).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
