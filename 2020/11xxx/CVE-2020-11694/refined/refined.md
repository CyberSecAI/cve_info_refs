Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11694:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The PyCharm distributive for Windows included the Apple Notarization Service credentials. These credentials were found within the `nt.py` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the inclusion of sensitive credentials (username `apple_notarization_service@jetbrains.com` and password `dqyf-mcwy-rovk-bvip`) directly within a distributed file, `nt.py`. These credentials are used for the Apple Notarization Service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker with access to the credentials could potentially misuse the Apple Notarization Service, potentially to sign and distribute malicious software.
-   **Supply Chain Attack:** The exposure of credentials in a widely used IDE could lead to a broader supply chain attack if an attacker were to inject malicious code or modify the notarization process.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Access to PyCharm Distributive:** An attacker would need access to a copy of the vulnerable PyCharm distributive for Windows that included the `nt.py` with the embedded credentials.
-   **Credential Extraction:**  The attacker would need to extract the credentials from the `nt.py` file. This could be done by anyone with access to the file, as they are clearly visible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Access to Vulnerable Software:** The attacker needs access to the affected PyCharm versions (2019.3.3, 2019.2.6).
-   **Technical Skill:** Basic Python and file system navigation skills to locate and view the `nt.py` file and extract the credentials.

**Additional Notes**
The provided `nt.py` file includes many other environment variables, which may be considered sensitive information. While not directly related to CVE-2020-11694 (Apple notarization credentials) these variables might present other potential security concerns if abused.
