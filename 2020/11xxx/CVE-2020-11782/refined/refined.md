This document discusses a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is not related to CVE-2020-11782. The document refers to advisory PSV-2018-0530.

Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the web interface of the affected routers and gateways. The exact location of the stored XSS is not provided in the advisory.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Stored XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the device's web interface.
Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the device's web interface, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement of the web interface, or further malicious actions.
Attack vectors: The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts via a vulnerable input field or parameter in the device's web interface, which is then stored on the device. When a user accesses a page containing the stored malicious script, it is executed in the user's browser.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the capability to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable web interface. This typically requires some level of access to the device, such as through the web interface. The advisory doesn't describe the required level of access in detail. The CVSS vector states that user interaction is not required (UI:N), but High privileges are required (PR:H).
