{
  "vulnerability": {
    "overview": "A potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's \"Privacy\" controls. The password check was performed through a character-by-character string comparison.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the character-by-character string comparison used to validate passwords for password-protected pages. This allows an attacker to measure the time taken by the check, and potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-208",
      "CWE-362"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can measure the time taken by the password check with a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password, thus bypassing the password protection of private pages/documents.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through network access to a Wagtail instance, where an attacker is able to send password attempts and measure the response time with a high degree of accuracy.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send requests to the Wagtail application and measure the time taken by the password check, with high accuracy. This is understood to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet, according to the provided link."
