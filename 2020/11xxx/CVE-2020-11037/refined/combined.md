# Potential timing attack on password-protected private pages

Low

[gasman](/gasman)
published
GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6
May 4, 2020

## Package

wagtail
(PyPI)

## Affected versions

<2.7.2, 2.8-2.8.1

## Patched versions

2.7.3, 2.8.2, 2.9

## Description

### Impact

A potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's "Privacy" controls. This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password. (This is [understood to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/iAaq0pvHXuA/fpUuwjK3i2wJ).)

Privacy settings that restrict access to pages / documents on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected by this vulnerability.

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.3 (for the LTS 2.7 branch), Wagtail 2.8.2 and Wagtail 2.9.

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can use [user- or group-based privacy restrictions](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/advanced_topics/privacy.html) to restrict access to sensitive information; these are unaffected by this vulnerability.

### Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Thibaud Colas for reporting this issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Email us at security@wagtail.io (if you wish to send encrypted email, the public key ID is `0x6ba1e1a86e0f8ce8`)

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-11037

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

## Potential Observable Timing Discrepancy in Wagtail

Moderate severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6/dependabot)

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.3
>= 2.8rc1, < 2.8.2
= 2.9rc1

## Patched versions

2.7.3
2.8.2
2.9

## Description

### Impact

A potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's "Privacy" controls. This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password. (This is [understood to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/iAaq0pvHXuA/fpUuwjK3i2wJ).)

Privacy settings that restrict access to pages / documents on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected by this vulnerability.

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.3 (for the LTS 2.7 branch), Wagtail 2.8.2 and Wagtail 2.9.

### Workarounds

Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can use [user- or group-based privacy restrictions](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/advanced_topics/privacy.html) to restrict access to sensitive information; these are unaffected by this vulnerability.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# Support[¶](#support "Link to this heading")

If you have any problems or questions about working with Wagtail, you are invited to visit any of the following support channels, where volunteer members of the Wagtail community will be happy to assist.

**Please respect the time and effort of volunteers, by not asking the same question in multiple places.** At best, you’ll be spamming the same set of people each time; at worst, you’ll waste the effort of volunteers who spend time answering a question unaware that it has already been answered elsewhere. If you absolutely must ask a question on multiple forums, post it on Stack Overflow first and include the Stack Overflow link in your subsequent posts.

## Stack Overflow[¶](#stack-overflow "Link to this heading")

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wagtail) is the best place to find answers to your questions about working with Wagtail - there is an active community of Wagtail users and developers responding to questions there. When posting questions, please read Stack Overflow’s advice on [how to ask questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and remember to tag your question with “wagtail”.

## Slack[¶](#slack "Link to this heading")

The Wagtail Slack workspace is open to all users and developers of Wagtail. To join, head to: <https://wagtail.org/slack/>

Please use the **#support** channel for support questions. Support is provided by members of the Wagtail community on a voluntary basis, and we cannot guarantee that questions will be answered quickly (or at all). If you want to see this resource succeed, please consider sticking around to help out! Also, please keep in mind that many of Wagtail’s core and expert developers prefer to handle support queries on a non-realtime basis through Stack Overflow, and questions asked there may well get a better response.

## GitHub discussions[¶](#github-discussions "Link to this heading")

Our [GitHub discussion boards](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions) are open for sharing ideas and plans for the Wagtail project.

## Issues[¶](#issues "Link to this heading")

If you think you’ve found a bug in Wagtail, or you’d like to suggest a new feature, please check the current list at [github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues). If your bug or suggestion isn’t there, raise a new issue, providing as much relevant context as possible.

If your bug report is a security issue, **do not** report it with an issue. Please read our guide to [reporting security issues](contributing/security.html).

## Torchbox[¶](#torchbox "Link to this heading")

Finally, if you have a query which isn’t relevant for any of the above forums, feel free to contact the Wagtail team at Torchbox directly, on hello@wagtail.org or [@wagtail@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/%40wagtail).
