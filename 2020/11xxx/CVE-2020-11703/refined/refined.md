Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-11703:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**
   - The github content references "HTTP Response Splitting" in the path `belong2yourself/vulnerabilities/tree/master/ProVide/Web User Interface - HTTP Response Splitting`
   - HTTP Response Splitting is a type of vulnerability that the CVE may be related to
   - The content from `www.provideserver.com` is for ProVide server, which could be vulnerable

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The github content indicates the presence of an HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability within the ProVide web user interface, however, details about the root cause of this vulnerability are not provided in the provided documents
   -  HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities generally arise from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input that is included in HTTP response headers. Specifically the lack of proper sanitization of newline characters can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary headers.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The primary weakness identified is the presence of an HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability in the ProVide web user interface.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Exploitation of HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
        - Redirect users to malicious websites.
        - Inject malicious content into web pages.
        - Conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
        - Manipulate the response headers to perform further attacks, such as cache poisoning.
   - The specific impact depends on the context of the vulnerability.

**5. Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the web interface of the ProVide server.
    - An attacker would manipulate input (likely through GET or POST parameters) that will be reflected in HTTP response headers
    - An attacker would need to craft requests with malicious newline sequences to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the vulnerable ProVide server.
   - No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required.
   - The attacker needs to understand how the web application incorporates user input into HTTP response headers to craft a successful attack.
   - The attack can be initiated from a remote location (i.e., over a network), assuming the vulnerable application is accessible

**Additional Notes:**
- The github content does not contain the full details, it is pointing to a directory related to a vulnerability, but not the specific code.
- The `www.provideserver.com` content provides general information about the product and security measures. While it indicates a focus on security (such as support for various encryption algorithms, achieving a perfect score at Qualys SSL Labs test etc) it does not mention the specific vulnerability directly. It highlights that they have implemented features for security, but this does not mean that they are not vulnerable in some other way.
- The github content includes a redirect notice: "Object Moved to <https://belong2yourself.github.io/vulnerabilities/>" indicating that further information may be available at that location.

**Summary:**

The provided information indicates a potential HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability in the ProVide web user interface. The attack would involve crafting malicious HTTP requests with injected newline characters to manipulate HTTP response headers, leading to potential redirects, malicious content injection, and other attacks. However, neither content provides the exact details of the vulnerable code.
