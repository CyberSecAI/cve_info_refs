{
  "CVE-2020-11579": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file disclosure by exploiting the MySQL LOCAL INFILE feature through a malicious MySQL server. This is possible due to the lack of proper protection on an API endpoint in PHPKB, which remains accessible to unauthenticated users after the initial configuration.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the insecure use of the MySQL `LOCAL INFILE` feature in combination with an unprotected API endpoint in PHPKB.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unprotected API endpoint",
      "Insecure use of MySQL LOCAL INFILE",
      "Lack of authentication checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read any file on the remote host with web-server privileges. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information like database credentials and configuration files.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint in PHPKB. This request triggers a database connection to a malicious MySQL server controlled by the attacker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to host a malicious MySQL server, and to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHPKB instance."
