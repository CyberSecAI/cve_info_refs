Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11956:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The web server on the affected Rittal devices runs as root.
*   **Weakness:** Violation of the principle of least privilege. The webserver should not run as root.
*  **Impact:** A command injection vulnerability within the webserver would result in privilege escalation to root access on the entire device.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of a command injection vulnerability within the web server application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to identify and exploit a command injection vulnerability within the web server. This implies they would need some knowledge of web application vulnerabilities and how to trigger them on the affected web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report notes that multiple Rittal products are affected, including CMC III PU Compact, CMC III PU 7030.000, PDU (whole portfolio), LCP-CW, and IoT Interface 3124.300.
*   The vendor acknowledges the issue and states it will be fixed in a future update, but no schedule is available as of the date of the advisory.
*   The provided text connects this vulnerability to a previously mentioned command injection vulnerability in the NTP server setting (CVE-2020-11953), in that the impact of the webserver running as root means that exploiting a command injection anywhere in the web application is likely to have a more significant impact.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

CVE-2020-11956 highlights a critical security issue where the web server on Rittal devices runs with root privileges, which is a violation of the least privilege principle. This could allow a relatively simple command injection attack against the webserver to immediately gain root access to the device. This vulnerability, combined with other issues, leads to a severe risk for Rittal product users.
