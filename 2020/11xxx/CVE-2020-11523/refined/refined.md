{
  "CVE-2020-11523": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `gdi_RectToCRgn` function when calculating the width or height of a rectangle.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer overflow leads to an out-of-bounds write when bitmap data is cached, potentially causing a heap overflow. This could result in a denial of service or potentially allow arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send crafted RDP data with specially sized rectangles to trigger the integer overflow."
