The provided document details a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. While this document does not directly reference CVE-2020-11774, it is related as it provides information on a stored XSS vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router models.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The document states a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists on the listed devices. It does not go into specifics as to which input is vulnerable or what type of injection takes place.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application that are then stored and executed by other users who access the affected area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript within a user's browser when they access the affected router's web interface. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement
    - Further compromise of the network

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the web interface of the affected NETGEAR routers.
-  Attackers can inject malicious scripts through an unspecified field within the router's administration interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have access to the router's management interface, which implies either local network access, or access through the router's exposed web interface.
- Since it is a stored XSS vulnerability the attack would only require a single successful injection. Afterwards every user who accesses the vulnerable page would become a victim.
- The advisory does state that administrative level privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability. (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
