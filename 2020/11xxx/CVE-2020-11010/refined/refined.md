Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input when generating SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This issue affected the Tortoise ORM library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation/sanitization before incorporating user-provided strings into SQL queries. Specifically:
  - **MySQL:** Vulnerable to SQL injection, especially when filtering or doing mass-updates on char/text fields.
  - **SQLite & PostgreSQL:** Vulnerable when filtering using `contains`, `starts_with` or `ends_with` filters (and their case-insensitive counterparts).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
  - Execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
  - Potentially read, modify, or delete data within the database.
  - Possibly gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or system functionality depending on the database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
Attackers could leverage the following:
  - Injecting malicious SQL code through user-supplied values passed to filters such as `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`.
  - Manipulating input to trigger SQL injection through char/text fields during updates.
  - Exploiting lack of input sanitization in database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to influence input to the vulnerable application which uses the affected Tortoise ORM.
  - No specific elevated privileges are explicitly mentioned, but the ability to pass input to the vulnerable application is necessary.

**Additional Details:**
  - The fix involves changes to how the ORM library builds SQL statements, including escaping special characters and using `LIKE` clauses with `ESCAPE` clauses.
  - The commit 91c3640 addresses the vulnerability by adding proper sanitization of string values before including them in SQL queries in `tortoise/filters.py` and `tortoise/backends/mysql/executor.py` files
  - The commit introduces a new `StrWrapper` class for MySQL that does not rely on the monkey-patched `ValueWrapper`.
  - Fuzz tests are added to `tests/test_fuzz.py` to ensure that special chars are handled correctly.
  - Specific escape mechanisms are added to the `filters.py` to prevent SQL injection when using `LIKE` conditions.
