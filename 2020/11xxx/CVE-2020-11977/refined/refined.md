- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Flowable extension in Apache Syncope allows administrators with workflow entitlements to use Shell Service Tasks. These tasks can be exploited to perform malicious operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability via Shell Service Tasks in Flowable workflow definitions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can perform malicious operations, including file read, file write, and code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious Flowable workflow definitions using Shell Service Tasks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An administrator with workflow entitlements.
