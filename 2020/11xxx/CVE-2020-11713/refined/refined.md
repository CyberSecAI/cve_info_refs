Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `wc_ecc_mulmod_ex` function within the `ecc.c` file of wolfSSL 4.3.0. This function's implementation for modular multiplication in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is susceptible to timing side-channel attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Timing Side-Channel:** The core issue is that the execution time of `wc_ecc_mulmod` varies depending on the input values, specifically the scalar `k`. This variation in timing leaks information that an attacker can exploit to recover the private key.
- **Non-Constant Time Implementation:** The code does not perform its operations in a constant time manner, making it vulnerable to timing analysis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Private Key Recovery:** An attacker can potentially recover the private key used to sign messages by observing the timing variations of the vulnerable `wc_ecc_mulmod` function.
- **Compromised Cryptographic Security:** Successful exploitation leads to a complete breakdown of the cryptographic security provided by the ECC implementation, allowing for impersonation, data tampering, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Timing Analysis:** The attack vector involves measuring the execution time of the `wc_ecc_mulmod` function over multiple executions, using different inputs or operations.
- **Side-Channel Leakage:** The attacker exploits the timing side-channel to extract information about the private key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to time function execution:** The attacker must be able to measure the precise execution time of the vulnerable code. This is often achieved by performing local timing measurements or via remote timing attacks that exploit network latency.
- **Access to an environment performing cryptographic operations:** The attacker must be able to initiate or trigger cryptographic operations using the vulnerable library in order to analyze execution times.
- **Repeated execution of operation:** Multiple executions are generally required to collect enough timing data to effectively perform the analysis and recover keys.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable implementation:** The attacker must know about the existence of the timing leak in the implementation.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was created and shared to demonstrate the vulnerability. This PoC shows that the execution time of `wc_ecc_mulmod` varies significantly depending on the scalar value 'k'.
- The fix for this vulnerability is in the commit "[Change constant time and cache resistant ECC mulmod](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/2894/commits/ffd06e359fd7599e3bd7aaebc841b6a07feee071)", where the code is modified to ensure the points being operated on change to make constant time.

In summary, CVE-2020-11713 is a timing side-channel vulnerability in the `wc_ecc_mulmod` function of wolfSSL 4.3.0, allowing an attacker to potentially extract private keys by observing the execution times of cryptographic operations. The fix involves making sure the underlying ECC math is done in constant time.
