Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11077:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided text from multiple sources, including the official CVE description, clearly identifies this CVE as related to HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in the Puma RubyGem, specifically when Puma is used behind a proxy with persistent connections and HTTP pipelining. All the provided data confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability details:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from Puma's improper handling of pipelined HTTP requests when behind a proxy that uses persistent connections. The proxy may mistake a pipelined request as part of the first request body, leading to request smuggling.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper handling of pipelined HTTP requests.
    *   Lack of proper validation of request boundaries when behind a proxy.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can send a crafted request that bypasses proxy and is instead processed by the backend. This may result in:
    *   **Response smuggling:** An attacker can cause the proxy to send a response intended for the attacker to a different client by injecting a second request into the initial connection.
    *   **Data corruption:** An attacker may be able to corrupt data or redirect users.
    *   **Information leakage**: Sensitive information may be inadvertently exposed to unintended users.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a network connection, where an attacker interacts with a vulnerable Puma instance via a proxy.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a proxy that is connected to a vulnerable Puma server.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send pipelined HTTP requests.
    *  The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.

**3. Technical Details & Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability occurs when a proxy reuses a persistent connection to send another request for a different client and the first client sends another request via HTTP pipelining.
*   Puma parses the pipelined request as a separate request while the proxy sees the pipelined request as a part of the first request body.
*   This causes a response mismatch.
*   The vulnerability is similar to but different from [CVE-2020-11076](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11076.html), which involves an invalid transfer-encoding header.
*  The vulnerability was resolved in Puma versions 3.12.6 and 4.3.5.

**4. Remediation**
The vulnerability is patched in versions 3.12.6 and 4.3.5 of the Puma gem. Users are advised to update to the latest version.

**5. CVSS scores:**
CVSS v3 score : 6.8 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N)
CVSS v2 score : 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**6. Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   Some sources mention that TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 have also been disabled as part of the fix.
*   Different Linux distributions like openSUSE, Fedora and SUSE, have also released patches for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in Puma versions <= 3.12.5 and <= 4.3.4.
* The vulnerability is described in GitHub Security Advisory [GHSA-w64w-qqph-5gxm](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-w64w-qqph-5gxm).

In summary, this CVE describes an HTTP request smuggling vulnerability where an attacker can exploit the way Puma processes pipelined requests behind a proxy, potentially leading to the proxy sending responses to unintended clients. The vulnerability arises due to how Puma handles and interprets HTTP requests and transfer-encodings with persistent connections. The fix requires upgrading to Puma versions 3.12.6 or 4.3.5.
