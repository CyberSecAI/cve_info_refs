## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 33 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [BINUTILS235](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS235 "Changes/BINUTILS235")

* [F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 22nd. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f33
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f33. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f33 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f33
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-27 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

## 6.4.3 / 2024-09-19

* Security
  + Discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Without this, an attacker could overwrite values set by intermediate proxies (e.g. X-Forwarded-For). ([CVE-2024-45614](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4)/GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4)

## 6.4.2 / 2024-01-08

* Security
  + Limit the size of chunk extensions. Without this limit, an attacker could cause unbounded resource (CPU, network bandwidth) consumption. ([GHSA-c2f4-cvqm-65w2](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-c2f4-cvqm-65w2))

## Description

![@bmclean](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/622145?v=4&size=48)[bmclean](https://github.com/bmclean)opened [on Feb 27, 2020](https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/2132#issue-572431136)

**Describe the bug**

After upgrading to Puma 4.3.2, setting a cookie from within a controller action fails to create the cookie.

Example:

```
  def create
    cookies[:prompt_dismissed] = { value: true }
    redirect_to users_path
  end

```

Might be similar cause to [#2131](https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/2131)

# CVE-2020-11077

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-11076.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-11078.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-11077 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11077)

#### Description

In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This is a similar but different vulnerability from CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172175#c0)  Robert Frohl   2020-05-27 12:19:40 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-11077  In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This is a similar but different vulnerability from CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2398-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                          Abhijith PA

Package        : puma
Version        : 3.6.0-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-11076 CVE-2020-11077

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in puma, highly
concurrent HTTP server for Ruby/Rack applications.

CVE-2020-11076

    By using an invalid transfer-encoding header, an attacker could smuggle
    an HTTP response.

CVE-2020-11077

    client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to
    send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy uses
    persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP
    pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma,
    however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second
    request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the
    proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another
    request for a different client, the second response from the first
    client will be sent to the second client.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
3.6.0-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puma packages.

For the detailed security status of puma please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/puma>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# HTTP Smuggling via Transfer-Encoding Header

Moderate

[nateberkopec](/nateberkopec)
published
GHSA-w64w-qqph-5gxm
May 21, 2020

## Package

bundler

puma
([rubygems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 3.12.5, <= 4.3.4

## Patched versions

3.12.6, 4.3.5

## Description

### Impact

This is a similar but different vulnerability to the one patched in 3.12.5 and 4.3.4.

A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client.

If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma)
* See our [security policy](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/policy)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-11077

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A âPersonal Accountâ represents an individual Userâs authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a Userâs identity on GitHub. âOrganizationsâ are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The âAgreementâ refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the âTerms of Serviceâ or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. âContentâ refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. âUser-Generated Contentâ is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. âGitHub,â âWe,â and âUsâ refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The âServiceâ refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. âThe User,â âYou,â and âYourâ refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The âWebsiteâ refers to GitHubâs website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHubâs conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organizationâs data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that Userâs Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your countryâs minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your countryâs laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person â i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us â and other GitHub Users â certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 â D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 â D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statementâfor security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright Â© GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isnât available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, itâs important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHubâs confidential information (collectively, âConfidential Informationâ), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the âPurposeâ), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we donât otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

Weâre always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, âFeedbackâ), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneysâ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important â we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

Puma is a **simple, fast, multi-threaded, and highly parallel HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications**.

## Built For Speed & Parallelism

Puma is a server for [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack)-powered HTTP applications written in Ruby. It is:

* **Multi-threaded**. Each request is served in a separate thread. This helps you serve more requests per second with less memory use.
* **Multi-process**. "Pre-forks" in cluster mode, using less memory per-process thanks to copy-on-write memory.
* **Standalone**. With SSL support, zero-downtime rolling restarts and a built-in request bufferer, you can deploy Puma without any reverse proxy.
* **Battle-tested**. Our HTTP parser is inherited from Mongrel and has over 15 years of production use. Puma is currently the most popular Ruby webserver, and is the default server for Ruby on Rails.

Originally designed as a server for [Rubinius](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius), Puma also works well with Ruby (MRI) and JRuby.

On MRI, there is a Global VM Lock (GVL) that ensures only one thread can run Ruby code at a time. But if you're doing a lot of blocking IO (such as HTTP calls to external APIs like Twitter), Puma still improves MRI's throughput by allowing IO waiting to be done in parallel. Truly parallel Ruby implementations (TruffleRuby, JRuby) don't have this limitation.

## Quick Start

```
$ gem install puma
$ puma

```

Without arguments, puma will look for a rackup (.ru) file in
working directory called `config.ru`.

## SSL Connection Support

Puma will install/compile with support for ssl sockets, assuming OpenSSL
development files are installed on the system.

If the system does not have OpenSSL development files installed, Puma will
install/compile, but it will not allow ssl connections.

## Frameworks

### Rails

Puma is the default server for Rails, included in the generated Gemfile.

Start your server with the `rails` command:

```
$ rails server

```

Many configuration options and Puma features are not available when using `rails server`. It is recommended that you use Puma's executable instead:

```
$ bundle exec puma

```

### Sinatra

You can run your Sinatra application with Puma from the command line like this:

```
$ ruby app.rb -s Puma

```

In order to actually configure Puma using a config file, like `puma.rb`, however, you need to use the `puma` executable. To do this, you must add a rackup file to your Sinatra app:

```
# config.ru
require './app'
run Sinatra::Application
```

You can then start your application using:

```
$ bundle exec puma

```

## Configuration

Puma provides numerous options. Consult `puma -h` (or `puma --help`) for a full list of CLI options, or see `Puma::DSL` or [dsl.rb](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/lib/puma/dsl.rb).

You can also find several configuration examples as part of the
[test](https://github.com/puma/puma/tree/master/test/config) suite.

For debugging purposes, you can set the environment variable `PUMA_LOG_CONFIG` with a value
and the loaded configuration will be printed as part of the boot process.

### Thread Pool

Puma uses a thread pool. You can set the minimum and maximum number of threads that are available in the pool with the `-t` (or `--threads`) flag:

```
$ puma -t 8:32

```

Puma will automatically scale the number of threads, from the minimum until it caps out at the maximum, based on how much traffic is present. The current default is `0:16` and on MRI is `0:5`. Feel free to experiment, but be careful not to set the number of maximum threads to a large number, as you may exhaust resources on the system (or cause contention for the Global VM Lock, when using MRI).

Be aware that additionally Puma creates threads on its own for internal purposes (e.g. handling slow clients). So, even if you specify -t 1:1, expect around 7 threads created in your application.

### Clustered mode

Puma also offers "clustered mode". Clustered mode `fork`s workers from a master process. Each child process still has its own thread pool. You can tune the number of workers with the `-w` (or `--workers`) flag:

```
$ puma -t 8:32 -w 3

```

Or with the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable:

```
$ WEB_CONCURRENCY=3 puma -t 8:32

```

Note that threads are still used in clustered mode, and the `-t` thread flag setting is per worker, so `-w 2 -t 16:16` will spawn 32 threads in total, with 16 in each worker process.

If the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable is set to `"auto"` and the `concurrent-ruby` gem is available in your application, Puma will set the worker process count to the result of [available processors](https://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Concurrent.html#available_processor_count-class_method).

For an in-depth discussion of the tradeoffs of thread and process count settings, [see our docs](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/9282a8efa5a0c48e39c60d22ca70051a25df9f55/docs/kubernetes.md#workers-per-pod-and-other-config-issues).

In clustered mode, Puma can "preload" your application. This loads all the application code *prior* to forking. Preloading reduces total memory usage of your application via an operating system feature called [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write).

If the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable is set to a value > 1 (and `--prune-bundler` has not been specified), preloading will be enabled by default. Otherwise, you can use the `--preload` flag from the command line:

```
$ puma -w 3 --preload

```

Or, if you're using a configuration file, you can use the `preload_app!` method:

```
# config/puma.rb
workers 3
preload_app!
```

Preloading canât be used with phased restart, since phased restart kills and restarts workers one-by-one, and preloading copies the code of master into the workers.

#### Clustered mode hooks

When using clustered mode, Puma's configuration DSL provides `before_fork` and `on_worker_boot`
hooks to run code when the master process forks and child workers are booted respectively.

It is recommended to use these hooks with `preload_app!`, otherwise constants loaded by your
application (such as `Rails`) will not be available inside the hooks.

```
# config/puma.rb
before_fork do
  # Add code to run inside the Puma master process before it forks a worker child.
end

on_worker_boot do
  # Add code to run inside the Puma worker process after forking.
end
```

In addition, there is an `on_refork` and `after_refork` hooks which are used only in [`fork_worker` mode](/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/fork_worker.md),
when the worker 0 child process forks a grandchild worker:

```
on_refork do
  # Used only when fork_worker mode is enabled. Add code to run inside the Puma worker 0
  # child process before it forks a grandchild worker.
end
```

```
after_refork do
  # Used only when fork_worker mode is enabled. Add code to run inside the Puma worker 0
  # child process after it forks a grandchild worker.
end
```

Importantly, note the following considerations when Ruby forks a child process:

1. File descriptors such as network sockets **are** copied from the parent to the forked
   child process. Dual-use of the same sockets by parent and child will result in I/O conflicts
   such as `SocketError`, `Errno::EPIPE`, and `EOFError`.
2. Background Ruby threads, including threads used by various third-party gems for connection
   monitoring, etc., are **not** copied to the child process. Often this does not cause
   immediate problems until a third-party connection goes down, at which point there will
   be no supervisor to reconnect it.

Therefore, we recommend the following:

1. If possible, do not establish any socket connections (HTTP, database connections, etc.)
   inside Puma's master process when booting.
2. If (1) is not possible, use `before_fork` and `on_refork` to disconnect the parent's socket
   connections when forking, so that they are not accidentally copied to the child process.
3. Use `on_worker_boot` to restart any background threads on the forked child.
4. Use `after_refork` to restart any background threads on the parent.

#### Master process lifecycle hooks

Puma's configuration DSL provides master process lifecycle hooks `on_booted`, `on_restart`, and `on_stopped`
which may be used to specify code blocks to run on each event:

```
# config/puma.rb
on_booted do
  # Add code to run in the Puma master process after it boots,
  # and also after a phased restart completes.
end

on_restart do
  # Add code to run in the Puma master process when it receives
  # a restart command but before it restarts.
end

on_stopped do
  # Add code to run in the Puma master process when it receives
  # a stop command but before it shuts down.
end
```

### Error handling

If Puma encounters an error outside of the context of your application, it will respond with a 400/500 and a simple
textual error message (see `Puma::Server#lowlevel_error` or [server.rb](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/lib/puma/server.rb)).
You can specify custom behavior for this scenario. For example, you can report the error to your third-party
error-tracking service (in this example, [rollbar](https://rollbar.com)):

```
lowlevel_error_handler do |e, env, status|
  if status == 400
    message = "The server could not process the request due to an error, such as an incorrectly typed URL, malformed syntax, or a URL that contains illegal characters.\n"
  else
    message = "An error has occurred, and engineers have been informed. Please reload the page. If you continue to have problems, contact support@example.com\n"
    Rollbar.critical(e)
  end

  [status, {}, [message]]
end
```

### Binding TCP / Sockets

Bind Puma to a socket with the `-b` (or `--bind`) flag:

```
$ puma -b tcp://127.0.0.1:9292

```

To use a UNIX Socket instead of TCP:

```
$ puma -b unix:///var/run/puma.sock

```

If you need to change the permissions of the UNIX socket, just add a umask parameter:

```
$ puma -b 'unix:///var/run/puma.sock?umask=0111'

```

Need a bit of security? Use SSL sockets:

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?key=path_to_key&cert=path_to_cert'

```

#### Self-signed SSL certificates (via the [`localhost`](https://github.com/socketry/localhost) gem, for development use):

Puma supports the [`localhost`](https://github.com/socketry/localhost) gem for self-signed certificates. This is particularly useful if you want to use Puma with SSL locally, and self-signed certificates will work for your use-case. Currently, the integration can only be used in MRI.

Puma automatically configures SSL when the [`localhost`](https://github.com/socketry/localhost) gem is loaded in a `development` environment:

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```
group(:development) do
  gem 'localhost'
end
```

And require it implicitly using bundler:

```
require "bundler"
Bundler.require(:default, ENV["RACK_ENV"].to_sym)
```

Alternatively, you can require the gem in your configuration file, either `config/puma/development.rb`, `config/puma.rb`, or set via the `-C` cli option:

```
require 'localhost'
# configuration methods (from Puma::DSL) as needed
```

Additionally, Puma must be listening to an SSL socket:

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://localhost:9292' -C config/use_local_host.rb

# The following options allow you to reach Puma over HTTP as well:
$ puma -b ssl://localhost:9292 -b tcp://localhost:9393 -C config/use_local_host.rb
```

#### Controlling SSL Cipher Suites

To use or avoid specific SSL ciphers for TLSv1.2 and below, use `ssl_cipher_filter` or `ssl_cipher_list` options.

##### Ruby:

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?key=path_to_key&cert=path_to_cert&ssl_cipher_filter=!aNULL:AES+SHA'

```

##### JRuby:

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?keystore=path_to_keystore&keystore-pass=keystore_password&ssl_cipher_list=TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA'

```

To configure the available TLSv1.3 ciphersuites, use `ssl_ciphersuites` option (not available for JRuby).

##### Ruby:

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?key=path_to_key&cert=path_to_cert&ssl_ciphersuites=TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'

```

See <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html> for cipher filter format and full list of cipher suites.

Disable TLS v1 with the `no_tlsv1` option:

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?key=path_to_key&cert=path_to_cert&no_tlsv1=true'

```

#### Controlling OpenSSL Verification Flags

To enable verification flags offered by OpenSSL, use `verification_flags` (not available for JRuby):

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?key=path_to_key&cert=path_to_cert&verification_flags=PARTIAL_CHAIN'

```

You can also set multiple verification flags (by separating them with a comma):

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?key=path_to_key&cert=path_to_cert&verification_flags=PARTIAL_CHAIN,CRL_CHECK'

```

List of available flags: `USE_CHECK_TIME`, `CRL_CHECK`, `CRL_CHECK_ALL`, `IGNORE_CRITICAL`, `X509_STRICT`, `ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS`, `POLICY_CHECK`, `EXPLICIT_POLICY`, `INHIBIT_ANY`, `INHIBIT_MAP`, `NOTIFY_POLICY`, `EXTENDED_CRL_SUPPORT`, `USE_DELTAS`, `CHECK_SS_SIGNATURE`, `TRUSTED_FIRST`, `SUITEB_128_LOS_ONLY`, `SUITEB_192_LOS`, `SUITEB_128_LOS`, `PARTIAL_CHAIN`, `NO_ALT_CHAINS`, `NO_CHECK_TIME`
(see <https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags.html#VERIFICATION-FLAGS>).

#### Controlling OpenSSL Password Decryption

To enable runtime decryption of an encrypted SSL key (not available for JRuby), use `key_password_command`:

```
$ puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:9292?key=path_to_key&cert=path_to_cert&key_password_command=/path/to/command.sh'

```

`key_password_command` must:

1. Be executable by Puma.
2. Print the decryption password to stdout.

For example:

```
#!/bin/sh

echo "this is my password"
```

`key_password_command` can be used with `key` or `key_pem`. If the key
is not encrypted, the executable will not be called.

### Control/Status Server

Puma has a built-in status and control app that can be used to query and control Puma.

```
$ puma --control-url tcp://127.0.0.1:9293 --control-token foo

```

Puma will start the control server on localhost port 9293. All requests to the control server will need to include control token (in this case, `token=foo`) as a query parameter. This allows for simple authentication. Check out `Puma::App::Status` or [status.rb](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/lib/puma/app/status.rb) to see what the status app has available.

You can also interact with the control server via `pumactl`. This command will restart Puma:

```
$ pumactl --control-url 'tcp://127.0.0.1:9293' --control-token foo restart

```

To see a list of `pumactl` options, use `pumactl --help`.

### Configuration File

You can also provide a configuration file with the `-C` (or `--config`) flag:

```
$ puma -C /path/to/config

```

If no configuration file is specified, Puma will look for a configuration file at `config/puma.rb`. If an environment is specified (via the `--environment` flag or through the `APP_ENV`, `RACK_ENV`, or `RAILS_ENV` environment variables) Puma looks for a configuration file at `config/puma/<environment_name>.rb` and then falls back to `config/puma.rb`.

If you want to prevent Puma from looking for a configuration file in those locations, include the `--no-config` flag:

```
$ puma --no-config

# or

$ puma -C "-"

```

The other side-effects of setting the environment are whether to show stack traces (in `development` or `test`), and setting RACK\_ENV may potentially affect middleware looking for this value to change their behavior. The default puma RACK\_ENV value is `development`. You can see all config default values in `Puma::Configuration#puma_default_options` or [configuration.rb](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/61c6213fbab/lib/puma/configuration.rb#L182-L204).

Check out `Puma::DSL` or [dsl.rb](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/lib/puma/dsl.rb) to see all available options.

## Restart

Puma includes the ability to restart itself. When available (MRI, Rubinius, JRuby), Puma performs a "hot restart". This is the same functionality available in *Unicorn* and *NGINX* which keep the server sockets open between restarts. This makes sure that no pending requests are dropped while the restart is taking place.

For more, see the [Restart documentation](/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/restart.md).

## Signals

Puma responds to several signals. A detailed guide to using UNIX signals with Puma can be found in the [Signals documentation](/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/signals.md).

## Platform Constraints

Some platforms do not support all Puma features.

* **JRuby**, **Windows**: server sockets are not seamless on restart, they must be closed and reopened. These platforms have no way to pass descriptors into a new process that is exposed to Ruby. Also, cluster mode is not supported due to a lack of fork(2).
* **Windows**: Cluster mode is not supported due to a lack of fork(2).
* **Kubernetes**: The way Kubernetes handles pod shutdowns interacts poorly with server processes implementing graceful shutdown, like Puma. See the [kubernetes section of the documentation](/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/kubernetes.md) for more details.

## Known Bugs

For MRI versions 2.2.7, 2.2.8, 2.2.9, 2.2.10, 2.3.4 and 2.4.1, you may see `stream closed in another thread (IOError)`. It may be caused by a [Ruby bug](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13632). It can be fixed with the gem <https://rubygems.org/gems/stopgap_13632>:

```
if %w(2.2.7 2.2.8 2.2.9 2.2.10 2.3.4 2.4.1).include? RUBY_VERSION
  begin
    require 'stopgap_13632'
  rescue LoadError
  end
end
```

## Deployment

* Puma has support for Capistrano with an [external gem](https://github.com/seuros/capistrano-puma).
* Additionally, Puma has support for built-in daemonization via the [puma-daemon](https://github.com/kigster/puma-daemon) ruby gem. The gem restores the `daemonize` option that was removed from Puma starting version 5, but only for MRI Ruby.

It is common to use process monitors with Puma. Modern process monitors like systemd or rc.d
provide continuous monitoring and restarts for increased reliability in production environments:

* [rc.d](/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/jungle/rc.d/README.md)
* [systemd](/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/systemd.md)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1842534#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-06-01 13:38:58 UTC  ``` In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This is a similar but different vulnerability from [CVE-2020-11076](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11076). The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.
