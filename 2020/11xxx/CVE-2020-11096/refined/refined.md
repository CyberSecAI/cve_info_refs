Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11096:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order` function of FreeRDP, where an out-of-bounds read occurs due to improper handling of bitmap cache data. Specifically, there's an issue when reading the cache bitmap v3 order which can cause a global out of bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Out-of-bounds read: The primary issue is that the code reads data beyond the allocated buffer, which could lead to memory corruption and other issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Information disclosure: An attacker may be able to read sensitive data from memory that is outside of the intended buffer.
- Denial of service: A crash could occur if the memory access leads to an invalid read or write.
- Possible arbitrary code execution: Although not confirmed in the provided documents, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be chained to gain arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network: A malicious server can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted RDP messages, triggering the out-of-bounds read in the client application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to control the RDP server or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to manipulate the RDP stream between the server and the client.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted bitmap cache related messages to the client.
- No authentication is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- This vulnerability is present in FreeRDP versions prior to 2.1.2.
- The issue is related to the `update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order` function.
- A workaround is to disable bitmap cache via the command line option `-bitmap-cache` in FreeRDP clients.
- The vulnerability was reported by Antonio Morales from GitHub Security Lab.
- Patches are available in FreeRDP version 2.1.2.
