## Releases

* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [qemu](/security/cves?package=qemu) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled bochs-display devices. A

local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service or

possibly execute arbitrary code in the host. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-15034](/security/CVE-2019-15034))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory during certain VNC

operations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause QEMU

to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 19.10.

([CVE-2019-20382](/security/CVE-2019-20382))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly generated QEMU Pointer

Authentication signatures on ARM. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to bypass PAuth. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.10.

([CVE-2020-10702](/security/CVE-2020-10702))

Ziming Zhang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled ATI VGA emulation. A

local attacker in a guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04

LTS. ([CVE-2020-11869](/security/CVE-2020-11869))

Aviv Sasson discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled Slirp networking. A

remote attacker could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 19.10.

([CVE-2020-1983](/security/CVE-2020-1983))

Subject: CVE-2020-11869 qemu: integer overflow in ati_2d_blt()
 in hw/display/ati-2d.c could lead to DoS

Hello all,

An integer overflow flaw was found in QEMU in the way it implemented the
ATI VGA
emulation. This flaw occurs in the ati_2d_blt() routine while handling MMIO
write
operations through ati_mm_write() callback. A malicious guest could abuse
this
flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service.

Upstream patch:
   ->
<https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=ac2071c3791b67fc7af78b8ceb320c01ca1b5df7>

This issue was reported by Ziming Zhang.
CVE-2020-11869 requested via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you,

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.
