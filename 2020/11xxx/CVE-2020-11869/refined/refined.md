Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-11869:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow exists in the `ati_2d_blt()` function within the ATI VGA emulation code of QEMU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in `ati_2d_blt()` function
- Improper handling of MMIO write operations via the `ati_mm_write()` callback.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious guest can exploit this vulnerability to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) on the host machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker within a guest virtual machine.
- The attacker triggers the vulnerability by manipulating MMIO write operations through the `ati_mm_write()` callback.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a guest virtual machine using QEMU.

**Additional notes**
- The vulnerability only affects Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as noted in the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4372-1).
- The issue was reported by Ziming Zhang.
