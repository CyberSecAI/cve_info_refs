Hi,

```
early last autumn we have conducted an assessment on MicroStrategy
Intellitence Server & Web 10.4, that brought to the discovery of six
different vulnerabilities and recently at the registration of a total of
five CVE(s).
```

CVE-2020-11450 - Information Disclosure in Axis2 Happiness Page

```
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above exposes JVM configuration, CPU
architecture, installation folder and other info through the URL
“/MicroStrategyWS/happyaxis.jsp”. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to learn more about the environment the application is
running in.
```

CVE-2020-11453 - Server-Side Request Forgery in Test Web Service

```
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above is vulnerable to Server-Side
Request Forgery in the “Test Web Service” functionality exposed through
the path “/MicroStrategyWS/”. The functionality requires no
authentication and, while it is not possible to pass arbitrary schemes
and parameters in the SSRF request, it is still possible to exploit it
to conduct port scanning. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
to enumerate the resources allocated in the network (IP addresses and
services exposed).
```

CVE-2020-11452- Server Side Request Forgery in adding external data

```
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above includes a functionality to
allow users to import files or data from external resources such as URLs
or databases in order to parse contents for dashboard creation. By
providing an external URL under attacker control it’s possible to send
requests to external resources or leak files from the local system using
the “file://” stream wrapper.
```

CVE-2020-11451 - Remote Code Execution in Upload Visualization Plugin

```
The “Upload Visualization” plugin in the Microstrategy admin panel
(version 10.4 and above) allows an administrator to upload a zip
archive containing files with arbitrary extensions and data. Access to
admin panel could be reached through SSRF (for example via
CVE-2020-11452).
```

CVE-2020-11454 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting in the Dashboard

```
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above is vulnerable to Stored
Cross-Site Scripting in the “HTML Container” and “Insert Text”
functionalities in the window allowing for the creation of a new
dashboard. In order to exploit this vulnerability an user need to have
access to a shared dashboard or the ability to create a dashboard on the
application.
```
