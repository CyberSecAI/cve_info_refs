```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application's "HTML Container" and "Insert Text" functionalities within the dashboard creation window do not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected dashboard. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or further attacks.
- Attack vectors: An attacker needs to have access to a shared dashboard or the ability to create a dashboard on the application. The attacker injects malicious script through the vulnerable "HTML Container" or "Insert Text" functionalities.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have user access with the ability to create or access shared dashboards.
