Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free error that occurs in the `update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order` function within FreeRDP. This function reads bitmap data from a stream, reallocates memory for it, and frees the memory in certain error conditions. The double free occurs when a zero length is provided for the allocation, leading to the original buffer being freed twice.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double free condition, where the same memory region is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.
- The code does not properly check the new length being passed to realloc. A zero length will lead to the original buffer being freed by realloc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Client Crash:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the FreeRDP client application crashing.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash can lead to a denial of service for the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious or manipulated RDP server sending specially crafted bitmap data to the FreeRDP client.
- The server sends a `CACHE_BITMAP_V3_ORDER` that has a zero length for bitmap data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control or manipulate the RDP server to send the malicious data to the vulnerable client.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the FreeRDP implementation details regarding `CACHE_BITMAP_V3_ORDER` processing.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects FreeRDP versions greater than 1.2 and before 2.0.0.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the new length is greater than zero before calling `realloc`. This ensures that realloc is not called with a zero size if it is not valid and the original buffer is not freed prematurely.
- The vulnerability is identified as having a "Low" severity.
- There are no known workarounds except to upgrade to a patched version.
