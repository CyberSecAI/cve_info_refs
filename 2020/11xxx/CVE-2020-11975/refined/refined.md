- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Apache Unomi allows the use of OGNL scripting in conditions. This scripting capability permits the invocation of static Java classes from the JDK, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code within the context of the running Java process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the use of OGNL scripting which provides access to static Java classes, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permission level of the running Java process. This could lead to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by providing malicious OGNL scripts as conditions to the vulnerable Apache Unomi instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to send malicious OGNL scripts to the Unomi server. The specifics of how to do this are not detailed.
