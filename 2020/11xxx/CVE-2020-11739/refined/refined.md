Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing memory barriers in the read-write unlock paths within the Xen hypervisor, specifically on ARM architectures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Memory Barriers:** The core issue is the absence of memory barrier instructions in the read-write unlock paths. This allows processors to reorder memory access operations, potentially leading to incorrect execution sequences.
*   **Race Condition:** Due to the missing barriers, the unlock operation might become visible to other processors before all the memory accesses within the "critical section" are completed. This creates a race condition where concurrent access to shared data occurs.
*   **Unsafe Critical Sections:** Assumptions made within critical sections (e.g., a variable remains unchanged after a check) are no longer valid due to potential race conditions, invalidating data integrity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Leaks:** A malicious guest may trigger the vulnerability and potentially leak hypervisor memory. Specifically mentioned is the case with concurrent use of `XENMAPSPACE_grant_table`.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the race condition could lead to hypervisor crashes, causing a denial-of-service for the system.
*   **Information Leak:** Data residing in the hypervisor memory could be exposed to the malicious guest.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated to be guaranteed, the vulnerability could potentially be a vector for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest OS:** A malicious guest OS running on Xen can exploit this issue through hypercalls.
*   **Hypercalls:** The vulnerability affects read-write locks used in hypercalls, such as grant-table operations, making these attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Guest:** The attacker needs to have control over a guest OS running on the Xen hypervisor.
*   **Concurrent Access Trigger:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the concurrent access to the vulnerable critical section

**Additional Notes:**

*   **ARM Architecture Specific:** The vulnerability is specifically stated to affect ARM architectures, which are susceptible to memory reordering. x86 systems are not affected.
*   **All Xen versions affected:** The issue is present in all versions of the Xen hypervisor.
*   **No mitigation:** There are no known mitigations other than patching to address the vulnerability.
*   **Vendor Patch Availability:** Patches are available for various distributions, including SUSE, Fedora, and openSUSE. SUSE provides a detailed list of affected products and their fixed versions.

**Summary of Affected Systems:**

*   Systems running any version of Xen hypervisor are vulnerable.
*   Vulnerability is architecture specific to ARM based systems.
*   x86 systems are not vulnerable to this specific issue.
