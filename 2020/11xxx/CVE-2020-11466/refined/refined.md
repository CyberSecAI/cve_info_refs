Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-11466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary cause is a lack of proper privilege validation at multiple API endpoints within the Deskpro software. Specifically, the `/api/tickets` endpoint did not adequately restrict access based on user roles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** The `/api/tickets` endpoint allowed any authenticated user to retrieve sensitive information about all helpdesk tickets stored in the database.
*   **Ticket Modification:** The vulnerability also leaked ticket authentication codes, which could be used to make unauthorized changes to tickets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data contained within helpdesk tickets.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or alter ticket data due to leaked auth codes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This specific vulnerability, when combined with others (such as the JWT secret leak), enables an attacker to escalate their privileges to administrator and achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Endpoint Abuse:** The attacker directly accessed the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/tickets`.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Deskpro system.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** This is part of an exploit chain that leads to remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker must have an account on the Deskpro system. This can be achieved via self-registration, which is enabled by default.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Deskpro instance to make API requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post by Redforce provides significant details about how this vulnerability was chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution on Deskpro instances.
*   The blog post also details the timeline of discovery, exploitation, and the response of Bitdefender and Deskpro.
*   The vulnerability affected versions prior to 2019.8.0.
