Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Anchore Engine's skopeo wrapper handled OS override options when downloading container images. Specifically, the system attempted to derive the OS override option from the image manifest itself, instead of using an explicit enumeration of supported OS overrides.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Command Injection:** By crafting a malicious container image manifest, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands into the skopeo command, potentially leading to remote code execution on the analyzer host. The vulnerability arises because the system was not using a predefined list of acceptable operating system override values.
2.  **Insecure Input Handling**: The system was using a value derived from the image manifest directly in a command to be executed. While there was an attempt at sanitization, it could be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the Anchore Engine analyzer service. This could lead to:
    - Access to the database credentials used by Engine, which have read-write ability.
    - Access to the running engine analyzer service environment.
    - If the Engine is run as root, then the attacker could gain root access to the execution environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

1. **Malicious Container Image:** The primary attack vector involves a crafted container image with a malicious manifest.
2.  **API Request:** The image analysis operation is triggered by an authenticated user via a valid API request to the Anchore Engine or by a manifest alteration of an image that anchore is already monitoring.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Image Registry Access:** An attacker would need the capability to push a crafted image to an image registry that Anchore Engine can access.
2.  **Authenticated User or Image Monitoring:** The attacker would need either to be an authenticated user able to trigger the analysis of a malicious image, or be able to alter the manifest of a container image already monitored by Anchore.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Anchore Engine version 0.7.1.
*   The fix involves removing the shell input path from any external source, thus preventing the command injection vulnerability. This was done by using an explicit enumeration of the os override options.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gabor Matuz, who responsibly disclosed it to Anchore.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
