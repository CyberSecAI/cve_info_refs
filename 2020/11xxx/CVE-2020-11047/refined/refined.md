{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the `autodetect_recv_bandwidth_measure_results` function. The function reads 8 bytes from the stream without ensuring that the stream has at least 8 remaining bytes, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious RDP server can potentially extract up to 8 bytes of client memory by sending a crafted, short bandwidth measurement result message and reading data from beyond the boundary of the buffer.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious server sends a manipulated bandwidth measurement result message to the FreeRDP client.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the RDP server to send a crafted message to a vulnerable FreeRDP client."
