Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11888:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `python-markdown2` handles element names during HTML conversion. Specifically, the regex used to parse element names was too permissive, failing to properly sanitize input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue is that the `python-markdown2` library does not properly sanitize element names in Markdown input, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary HTML attributes, including event handlers.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the output HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via crafted Markdown input, which would then be executed within the context of the user's browser when the HTML output is rendered.
*   **Session Hijacking:** In the context of a web application using the flawed `python-markdown2` library, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies or credentials.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker could modify content on the web page, or redirect users to other malicious websites.
*   **Data Theft:**  An attacker could potentially steal information from the user, by executing malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Markdown Input:** The primary attack vector is through providing specially crafted Markdown input that contains malicious HTML elements and attributes.
*   **Mishandled Element Names:** The vulnerability is triggered by the mishandling of non-alphanumeric characters in element names, specifically characters like `@` or `-` combined with an `onclick` attribute.
    *   Example payload: `<lol@/ //id="pwn"//onclick="alert(1)"//**abc**`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Markdown Input:** An attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious Markdown input into a system or application that uses `python-markdown2` to process and render Markdown. This could be through comments fields, text boxes, or any other input mechanism that processes markdown.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The vulnerability does not require any special privileges.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to interact with the malicious markdown (e.g., by viewing the content in their browser).

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was addressed in `python-markdown2` version 2.3.9.
*   Patches were released for various distributions, including Fedora and openSUSE.

In summary, CVE-2020-11888 is an XSS vulnerability in `python-markdown2` resulting from insufficient input sanitization of element names, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
