Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11032:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within text fields, specifically when handling ticket descriptions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw.  Malicious SQL code injected into a ticket description is executed when certain actions are performed on the ticket.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, which may lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the GLPI database. This could result in a complete compromise of the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Text Field Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious SQL code into a text field, specifically the description field of a ticket.
*   **Trigger via 'addme\_assign' or 'addme\_observer' buttons:** The injected SQL is then triggered when the user clicks on either 'addme\_assign' or 'addme\_observer' buttons.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Technician Account:** The attacker needs to have a technician-level account in the GLPI instance. This implies that the attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GLPI software.

**Additional Details (beyond official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is described as "High" severity.
*   The specific vulnerable versions are GLPI 9.4.5.
*   The patched version is GLPI 9.4.6.
*   The vulnerability is present since commit [4f7b489](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/commit/4f7b4897c85dae2b7b4c9887f0c74f17fb605864) and is fixed with commit [ebca9b1](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/commit/ebca9b1a7e6a347e30273f281e3518f34e42c8c4)
*   The provided description notes that the severity is not critical, as it requires a technician account, while the severity is labeled as "High".

In summary, CVE-2020-11032 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in GLPI that can be exploited by authenticated technician users by injecting malicious SQL code into ticket descriptions, posing a significant risk to the integrity and security of the GLPI application.
