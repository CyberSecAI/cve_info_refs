The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0526. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2020-11778, it describes a vulnerability that could be related.

Based on the information provided:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning that the malicious script is stored on the server (router in this case).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The advisory does not explicitly mention the full impact, however, an XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector would likely involve injecting the malicious script via a vulnerable web interface provided by the router, this can often be achieved through user controlled input fields which aren't properly sanitized on the backend.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely need to be authenticated to the web interface to inject the malicious script. The advisory does specify a CVSS:3.0 vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N which does indicate local network access (AV:L) and high privileges (PR:H) are required to exploit the vulnerability.

The advisory lists the affected NETGEAR product models and the firmware versions that are vulnerable.
