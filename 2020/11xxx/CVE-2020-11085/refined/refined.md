{
  "CVE-2020-11085": {
    "Description": "In FreeRDP before 2.1.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in cliprdr_read_format_list. Clipboard format data read (by client or server) might read data out-of-bounds. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.",
    "Root cause": "An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `cliprdr_read_format_list` function when parsing clipboard format data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash or denial-of-service when a client or server reads out-of-bounds. The impact is considered low because the client disconnects or the server disconnects the peer upon recognizing the out-of-bounds read.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious RDP server or client could send crafted clipboard format data to trigger the out-of-bounds read."
