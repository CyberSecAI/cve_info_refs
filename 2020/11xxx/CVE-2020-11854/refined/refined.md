Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-11854:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of a **hard-coded password** for a diagnostics user account within Micro Focus Operations Bridge Manager (OBM) and Application Performance Management (APM). This allows for unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of a hardcoded password, making it trivially easy to compromise the system.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** This flaw allows attackers to bypass authentication and gain access to the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected OBM or APM installations. This means an attacker can gain complete control over the system.
*   **System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary code, attackers can potentially read sensitive data, modify system configurations, install malware, and disrupt services.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute code in the context of SYSTEM, granting them the highest level of privileges on the machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack requires network access to the OBM or APM application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers require network connectivity to the vulnerable OBM or APM instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication as the hardcoded credential provides access.
