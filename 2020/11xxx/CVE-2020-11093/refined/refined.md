Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2020-11093:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-11093. The security advisory titled "**Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender.**" accurately describes the vulnerability. The provided commit `55056f2` also aims to address this vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks in the `NymHandler` when processing NYM transactions. Specifically, when a DID attempts to update another DID using a NYM transaction, the system was not properly verifying if the updating DID had the necessary permissions. The code was not checking if the updating DID was the owner of the DID being updated or if it was authorized as an endorser for that DID, when neither the ROLE nor VERKEY were being changed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control for NYM transactions. Any DID, regardless of its role or permissions, could modify the metadata of another DID (specifically the `from` field), as long as the `role` and `verkey` were not modified.
*   **Ledger Spamming:** As a result, an attacker could repeatedly send NYM transactions to modify the metadata (such as the alias) of a target DID, effectively spamming the ledger.
*   **Alias Spoofing/Modification:** The ability to change a DID's alias opens the possibility for alias spoofing or modification.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Ledger Pollution:** Malicious actors could flood the ledger with unnecessary NYM transactions, potentially impacting performance and storage.
*   **Metadata Manipulation:** Attackers can alter the metadata associated with a DID, such as the alias.
*  **Potential for Misidentification**: Modification of the `from` field could create confusion and potential misidentification of the actual owner of the DID.
*   **Reduced Trust:** The integrity of the ledger is compromised by allowing unauthorized modifications.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Indy network to submit transactions.
*   **Valid DID:** An attacker must possess a valid DID on the network to sign and send the malicious transactions.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network connectivity to the Indy network.
*   **Indy Client:** The attacker requires an Indy client (like `indy-cli`) to interact with the network and submit transactions.
*   **Valid DID:** An attacker must have a valid DID, but does not require any special role or permissions other than the ability to sign a transaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix implemented by commit `55056f2` addresses this vulnerability by adding a check to skip NYM edit operations that do not change the `role` or `verkey` if the transaction signer is not authorized.
*   The provided `auth_rules.md` file describes the expected authorization rules, highlighting the intended behavior for "Endorser using"
*   The security advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be triggered if neither the `ROLE` nor `VERKEY` are being changed, implying that there are existing authorization rules for operations that change `ROLE` or `VERKEY`.
* The advisory also notes that while the vulnerability allows for updates to the ledger state (seqNo + txnTime) without changes to state data, they initially considered it a minor bug, but, given its impact on DID ownership and metadata, recognized it as a higher severity.
* The advisory also points out that the vulnerability is located in the `NymHandler` method `update_state` in the line 62
* The content provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability using a provided `full_attack.sh` script
* The advisory also contains a section that notes the responsible disclosure by  `@alexandredeleze`

In summary, CVE-2020-11093 describes a critical access control vulnerability in `indy-node` that could be exploited by any user with a valid DID to potentially spam the ledger and modify the metadata of another user's DID.
