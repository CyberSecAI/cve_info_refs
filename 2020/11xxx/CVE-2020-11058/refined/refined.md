{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stream out-of-bounds seek in `rdp_read_font_capability_set` could lead to a later out-of-bounds read.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds seek",
    "Out-of-bounds read"
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A manipulated client or server might force a disconnect due to an invalid data read.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious RDP client or server sending a specially crafted font capability set.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the RDP data stream, either as a malicious server or by compromising the client."
