Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection within the Castel NextGen DVR application. The application includes a `__RequestVerificationToken` with state-changing requests, but it does not validate this token. This means that even if the token is missing or invalid, the requests will still be processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing CSRF Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of server-side validation for the `__RequestVerificationToken`. The application does not check if the token is valid or present before processing the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unintended State Changes:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended state-changing actions.
- **Account Manipulation:** An attacker can create, edit, or delete user accounts, including creating an admin account.
- **Configuration Changes:** Vulnerable to modification of application settings, such as SMTP configuration.
- **Secondary Exploitation:** By creating an admin account via the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information such as SMTP credentials, and leverage it to compromise other accounts, or further compromise the system.
- **Full system compromise:** Combining the CSRF vulnerability with other authorization bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-11680) escalates the impact to a full system compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker crafts a malicious webpage that includes a form or script that sends an HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a logged-in user into visiting the malicious webpage via email or another method.
- **Browser Exploitation:** The user's browser will send the crafted request to the vulnerable application on behalf of the user, thus leveraging the user's existing authenticated session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No prior access is required.**
- **Knowledge of the application's vulnerable endpoints** (e.g., the URLs and parameters for creating users, modifying settings).
- **Ability to host or distribute a malicious webpage.**
- **The attacker must rely on a user already being logged into the vulnerable application.**

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is demonstrated by removing the `__RequestVerificationToken` from state-changing requests.
- The application processes the request even without the token, meaning it is not being validated.
- The vulnerable endpoints include those for creating/modifying user accounts, alerts, archiving, file stores, LDAP settings, and SMTP settings.

This information provides a clear understanding of the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-11682) in the Castel NextGen DVR application.
