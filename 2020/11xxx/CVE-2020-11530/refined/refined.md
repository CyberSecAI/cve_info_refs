Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11530:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `chopslider/get_script/index.php` file of the Chop Slider 3 WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `$id` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without using prepared statements or parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. This occurs because the `$id` parameter from the GET request is directly concatenated into the SQL query string:
   ```php
   $cs_result = $wpdb->get_row('SELECT * FROM ' . CHOPSLIDER_TABLE_NAME . ' WHERE chopslider_id =' . $id);
   ```
   This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries within the context of the WordPress database user.
- **Data Breach:** This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Denial of Service:** By performing resource intensive queries the attacker might cause performance issues leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP GET request to the `chopslider/get_script/` endpoint.
- **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `id` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication and could be exploited by anyone with network access.
- **Knowledge of Plugin Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `chopslider/get_script/` file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Chop Slider version 3.
- The provided example injection strings demonstrate both content length manipulation and delay-based injection techniques, indicating a blind SQL injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 03/04/2020 with no response, and the CVE was assigned on 04/04/2020. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 07/05/2020.
- The recommended solution is to use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
