Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect permissions assigned to a resource used by the Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter service during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permission Assignment:** The installer sets insufficient or incorrect permissions on a resource utilized by the service. This allows a low-privileged user to potentially modify or access it.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this permission issue, a local attacker can gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to escalate from a low-privileged user to the SYSTEM level.
- **Code Execution:** This escalated privilege can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Full System Control:** Gaining SYSTEM level access can lead to complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Exploiting Incorrect Permissions:** The attacker leverages the incorrect permissions on the resource to escalate their privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have initial access to the system and the ability to execute low-privileged code.
- No special network access or user interaction is required beyond local code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter versions 10.40 and earlier.
- Micro Focus has released a patch to address the vulnerability
- The vulnerability was reported by Pedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security.
