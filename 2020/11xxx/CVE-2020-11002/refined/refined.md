    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a result of a server-side template injection in the self-validating feature of dropwizard-validation. It allows attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).",

      "attack_vectors": "By injecting arbitrary Java EL expressions into violation messages, attackers can execute code on the server.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious Java EL expressions, likely through a vulnerable input field of the application that uses the self-validating feature of `dropwizard-validation`."
