  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-11086",
    "description": "In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound read in ntlm_read_ntlm_v2_client_challenge that reads up to 28 bytes out-of-bound to an internal structure. This has been fixed in 2.1.0.",
    "affected_versions": "<= 2.0.0",
    "fixed_versions": "2.1.0",
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds read in the `ntlm_read_ntlm_v2_client_challenge` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read up to 28 bytes of out-of-bound memory.",
        "attack_vector": "Network",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with a FreeRDP server using NTLM authentication.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs in the NTLMv2 authentication process, specifically when reading the client challenge message. While 28 bytes can be read out of bounds, the impact of this vulnerability is described as low because a check is triggered which aborts processing the read data. This vulnerability affects both FreeRDP clients and servers using NTLM authentication. The fix was implemented in commit c098f21fdaadca57ff649eee1674f6cc321a2ec4 which implemented a check to prevent reading out of bounds."
