Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-11549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the sharing of the same password for both the web administration interface (HTTPS) and the underlying operating system's root account (accessible via Telnet if enabled). This means that gaining access to the web admin password also grants root access to the device.
*   The password for the web UI is synced to satellites in clear text via HTTP, making it possible to retrieve the password on a compromised satellite after some time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Credential Reuse:** The same password is used for both the web administration interface and the root account.
*   **Insecure Password Storage:** Passwords for the Web UI are stored in plaintext within the configuration file on the device.
*   **Insecure Communication:** The password for the web UI is synced between devices in clear text over HTTP.
*   **Weak Authentication:**  The SOAP authentication mechanism uses a hardcoded username and a password derived from MAC addresses using a simple MD5 hash, which is easily computed by an attacker.
*   **Unauthenticated Access to SOAP API:** The SOAP interface on the Orbi Pro systems is available via HTTP without proper authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to read and write configuration data if they know the password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) with Root Privileges:** By exploiting the weak SOAP authentication (CVE-2020-11551), an attacker can change the admin password on a satellite, enable telnet, and then gain root access to the device.
*   **Full Network Compromise:** After gaining root access on a satellite, attackers can retrieve the original admin password, gain access to the router/AP, and compromise the entire network. This includes reading and writing configuration parameters.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive information such as cleartext passwords, SSIDs, pre-shared keys of all configured WiFis, and other system settings.
*   **Persistence:** Attackers can establish persistence on the system for future use.
*   **Arbitrary Configuration Changes:**  Attackers can write arbitrary WiFi configuration data, such as authentication details, network settings, DNS, and system administration interface configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the Orbi Pro devices, either on the wired network (LAN) or a specific wireless network.
*   **SOAP API:** The primary attack vector is the unauthenticated SOAP API, which allows reading and writing of configuration data, including passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Orbi Pro devices (either via wired LAN or the primary admin WiFi network or the employee network if the setting is enabled for access).
*   **Basic Networking Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of networking and how to interact with HTTP and SOAP APIs.
*   **Exploitation Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SOAP requests, calculate the authentication password based on MAC addresses, and exploit vulnerabilities. The provided python scripts can be used for the exploitation process.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions a "bonus level" where the configuration backup files are "encrypted" using a weak pseudo-random number generator making it possible to decrypt the config and obtain the admin password.
*   The advisory mentions that some hardcoded default credentials were found in the code, although it is unclear if they are still active, or a legacy code.
*   Netgear silently pushed updates to fix the vulnerabilities, without notifying the researchers.
*   The fix implemented by Netgear on April 25th only prevents exploitation within minutes, but does not prevent an attacker from pwning the system within days or weeks, according to the advisory.
*   The vendor did not fully fix the issue according to the advisory (CVE-2020-11549), and only addressed the other ones (CVE-2020-11550, CVE-2020-11551)
