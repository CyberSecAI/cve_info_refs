    "summary": "The `postData()` function in `xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js` specifies the wildcard (`*`) as the `targetOrigin` when calling the `postMessage()` function on the `parent` object. Therefore any domain can load the application hosting the “magical iframe” and receive the messages that the “magical iframe” sends.",

        "details": "The `postData()` function in `xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js` uses a wildcard `*` as the `targetOrigin` when calling `postMessage()` on the `parent` object. This allows any domain to receive messages sent by the 'magical iframe'.",
        "impact": "An attacker can load the vulnerable application within a malicious site and receive sensitive data sent from the 'magical iframe', including data retrieved from the local storage. This can be combined with a lack of origin validation when receiving messages to extract all information from local storage.",
