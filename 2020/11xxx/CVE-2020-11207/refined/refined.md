Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-11207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from flaws in the automatically generated code by Qualcomm's Hexagon SDK, specifically when handling string arguments and in-out buffers within the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) libraries.
*   The SDK generates stub and skeleton code that improperly handles the length of input arguments, leading to a potential for out-of-bounds read/write access. Specifically, type casting to a signed integer for checking buffer boundaries can be bypassed with a negative input, leading to heap overflows.
*   Lack of version control allows loading older, vulnerable versions of the DSP libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect String Handling:** The stub code created by the SDK marshals string arguments by storing the string length in two places: a dedicated argument and also within the buffer itself. The skel code then extracts both lengths, compares them as signed integers. An attacker can ignore the stub code and provide a negative value for the string length, thus bypassing the validation.
*   **Incorrect Buffer Handling:** The stub code for in-out buffers splits them into separate input and output buffers, but the length of the input buffer can be manipulated with a negative value, causing a heap overflow during copy operations.
*  **Downgrade Vulnerability:** Lack of version checking for DSP libraries allows an attacker to load an older, vulnerable version of a library. This can bypass patches and exploit known vulnerabilities.
*   **Lack of Approved Library List**: There is no list of approved or denied libraries for a device, leading to the ability to run libraries from different devices, which can allow exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive information like photos, videos, call recordings, real-time microphone data, and GPS location by turning the phone into a spying tool.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can render the mobile phone unresponsive, making all stored information unavailable.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute malicious code on the DSP, hiding their activities.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Vulnerabilities in DSP drivers can be exploited to expand the attacker's privileges to the guest OS or DSP kernel level.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Access to camera and audio stream data can lead to manipulation of real-time data.
*   **System Instability:** Can trigger a DSP kernel panic, leading to device reboot and DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious Android application can exploit these vulnerabilities. The application doesn't need special permissions, only the ability to invoke DSP functions.
*   **Direct DSP Invocation:** Attackers can directly invoke methods from skel libraries by using the `remote_handle_open` and `remote_handle_invoke` functions and crafting malicious parameters to bypass the standard stub code.
*   **Downgrade Attack:** By placing a vulnerable, older version of the library in a path searched earlier, the malicious application can force loading of the exploitable library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to install an app:** The attacker needs the ability to install a malicious application on an Android device.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Libraries:** The attacker needs to know which libraries are vulnerable and how to exploit them.
*   **Understanding of FastRPC:** The attacker needs to be able to use the FastRPC mechanism to communicate with the DSP.
*  **Bypass Standard Stub Code**: The attacker needs to bypass the intended stub code and provide the malicious input directly to the DSP.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This research was conducted by Check Point Research, who discovered over 400 vulnerabilities in Qualcomm's DSP chips.
*   Qualcomm has assigned CVE-2020-11207 along with others for the reported vulnerabilities and addressed the issues in their November 2020 security patch.
*   The research used a combination of fuzzing with QEMU and AFL to identify vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were found in the DSP's user domain but also affect the QDI drivers in the Guest OS domain, leading to a wider range of potential exploits.
