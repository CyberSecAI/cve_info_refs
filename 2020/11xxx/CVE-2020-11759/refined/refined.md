Based on the provided documents, here's the information about CVE-2020-11759:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflows in `CompositeDeepScanLine::Data::handleDeepFrameBuffer` and `readSampleCountForLineBlock`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can write to an out-of-bounds pointer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a maliciously crafted EXR image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted EXR image file to a vulnerable application. No special privileges or network access is explicitly required, so it would be a local attack, with user interaction required for the vulnerable application to process the malicious image file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in OpenEXR versions prior to 2.4.1.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the software handles deep scanline data, particularly when processing sample counts and frame buffer data.
*   Multiple sources confirm the out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to integer overflows during the processing of deep data.
*   Apple's security advisories confirm that this CVE affects iCloud for Windows and watchOS, indicating that the vulnerability exists in the ImageIO library that is used on those platforms.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in OpenEXR version 2.4.1.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates the vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
