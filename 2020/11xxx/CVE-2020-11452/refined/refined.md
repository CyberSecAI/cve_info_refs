Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2020-11452:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the MicroStrategy Web application's functionality that allows users to import data from external resources such as URLs or databases. By providing a crafted external URL, an attacker can exploit this functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied URLs used in the data import process, allowing an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs.
- Lack of URL scheme validation: The application allows the use of the "file://" scheme, which permits reading local files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- SSRF: An attacker can send requests to external resources, potentially enumerating internal network resources and services.
- Local file disclosure: By using the "file://" stream wrapper, an attacker can potentially access and leak sensitive files from the local system.
- The vulnerability could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities for further impact (e.g. CVE-2020-11451).

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker provides a malicious URL to the vulnerable import functionality. This could be an external URL under the attacker's control or a "file://" URL targeting local resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to access the data import functionality of MicroStrategy Web 10.4 or possibly later versions.
- The attacker has to be able to provide an external URL that will be used by the server for importing data.
