  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-11677",
      "root_cause": "The `mkdict.c` program uses the variable `sbuf` as both source and destination of `sprintf()` in the `mask_tick()` function, leading to undefined behavior and potential data corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The program `mkdict.c` has an issue where the variable `sbuf` is used as both the source and destination in a `sprintf` call, causing undefined behavior and potential data corruption.",
        "The program also contains a buffer overflow vulnerability where it copies an environment variable into a 30-byte buffer using `strcpy()` without any boundary checks.",
        "Data is not escaped when writing a certain format output file, such as in `write_csvfile()`, where values are written without escaping the field delimiter (semicolon). If any of the fields contain a semicolon, it would break out of the field."
      ],
      "impact": "Potential data corruption and buffer overflow. If an attacker can control the input or environment variables, they could cause the program to crash, corrupt data, or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local user with the ability to execute the program and control input or environment variables.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local user with the ability to execute the program and control input or environment variables to exploit the vulnerability. The report also indicates that the arguments might be reachable through the network if called by another tool on the system, but more information is needed to confirm."
