Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-11089:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `irp` (I/O Request Packet) handling functions within FreeRDP. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing incoming data streams related to various channel redirections.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability allows reading data from memory locations outside of the intended buffer boundaries. This occurs in several IRP functions:
    *   `parallel_process_irp_create`
    *   `serial_process_irp_create`
    *   `drive_process_irp_write`
    *   `printer_process_irp_write`
    *   `rdpei_recv_pdu`
    *   `serial_process_irp_write`
*   The vulnerability is related to how the client processes data in the mentioned channel redirections.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads can potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the client's memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a malicious server could cause the client to crash or become unstable. This is due to accessing invalid memory locations, which could lead to program termination.
*   **Code Execution (Potential):** Although not directly confirmed in the provided information, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be chained to more severe issues such as arbitrary code execution.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attacks:** The attack is initiated by a malicious RDP server sending specially crafted data to the vulnerable FreeRDP client. This can happen over a network connection.
*   **Channel Redirection:** The attack targets IRP handling in specific RDP channels, including:
    *   Parallel port redirection
    *   Serial port redirection
    *   Drive redirection
    *   Printer redirection
    *   Multitouch redirection

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious RDP Server:** The attacker must be able to control or impersonate an RDP server that the vulnerable client connects to.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network such that they can communicate with the victim's RDP client.
*   **Knowledge of RDP Protocol:** The attacker needs to be familiar with RDP protocol details to craft malicious payloads for the vulnerable channel redirections.
*   **Authentication:** The SUSE information states "Authentication: Single" for the CVSS v2 score, meaning the attacker needs to have authenticated with the RDP service.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided GitHub commit logs show fixes in multiple files (`drive_main.c`, `printer_main.c`, `rdpei_main.c`, `serial_main.c`, `rdg.c` and `nego.c`)
*   The Suse security advisory mentions a severity of "important".
*   The vulnerability is fixed in FreeRDP version 2.1.0 and later.
*   Workarounds are suggested to avoid using the vulnerable channel redirections (e.g. avoid using `/parallel`, `/drive`, `/servial`, `/printer` or `+multitouch` command line options).
*   The `lists.opensuse.org` content shows that the fix was part of a larger update including fixes for many CVEs.

In summary, CVE-2020-11089 involves an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in FreeRDP's IRP handling functions, which can be exploited by a malicious RDP server to potentially disclose information, cause a denial of service, or potentially lead to code execution. The vulnerability affects multiple RDP channel redirections and requires the attacker to control a malicious server and establish a network connection with a vulnerable client.
