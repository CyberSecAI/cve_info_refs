Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the Faye server recognizes meta channels. It uses a prefix-match instead of a strict equality check when parsing channel names. Specifically, the server treats a message to any channel that's a prefix of `/meta/handshake`, `/meta/connect`, `/meta/subscribe`, `/meta/unsubscribe`, or `/meta/disconnect` as if it were an exact match. This means that a message to, for example, `/meta/subscribe/x` is still processed as a subscription request, bypassing intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass for subscription requests. Extensions that implement access control for channels typically check incoming messages to the `/meta/subscribe` channel. Because the server incorrectly parses channels, a client can bypass these checks by sending messages to `/meta/subscribe/x` or similar channels.
*   **Improper Input Validation**: The server does not perform a strict equality check on the channel name when processing meta messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Subscription:** A malicious client can bypass authentication extensions and subscribe to channels without proper authorization, thus gaining access to sensitive data or actions.
*   **General Meta Channel Manipulation:** The vulnerability affects all meta channels, so similar bypasses can occur for other meta operations (handshake, connect, disconnect, and unsubscribe).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious client sends a message to a meta channel with an appended path segment, e.g., `/meta/subscribe/x`.
*   The server incorrectly interprets this as a valid meta channel request (e.g., a subscription request for `/meta/subscribe`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the Faye server.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in both Node.js and Ruby versions of the Faye server since version 0.5.0.
*   The issue was fixed by implementing a strict equality check for meta channel names.
*   The patch was released in versions 1.0.4, 1.1.3, and 1.2.5.
*   A workaround for users who cannot install the patch was to change extensions to check if the channel *begins* with the expected channel name (e.g., `message.channel.startsWith('/meta/subscribe')`).

The provided information aligns with the CVE description, which is about an authentication bypass in the Faye server due to improper channel parsing. The content also gives more details about the vulnerability.
