Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11524:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in the `RLEDECOMPRESS` function of `interleaved.c`. This occurs because of a misjudgment of unsigned data during decompression, causing an excessive amount of data to be decompressed and copied. The `ENSURE_CAPACITY` function uses unsigned integer data types, which results in the judgment always being true, even when the available buffer is smaller than the data size to be copied. When the data copy is performed, the size of the data exceeds the allocated buffer `interleaved->TempSize` which leads to the out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write.
- Incorrect size calculation and capacity check in the RLE decompression algorithm, specifically in `ENSURE_CAPACITY`.
- Use of unsigned integer types that prevent accurate size checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption, leading to a crash (denial of service).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if exploited further.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted RDP data stream with RLE compressed bitmaps.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted RDP data stream to a vulnerable FreeRDP server/client.
- Attacker needs to have a session established via RDP.
- Authentication is required as a single authenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be triggered over the network.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The `ENSURE_CAPACITY` function incorrectly calculates available buffer space, failing to prevent the out-of-bounds write.
- The vulnerability was fixed by commit `7b1d4b49391b4512402840431757703a96946820` which corrected the  `ENSURE_CAPACITY` function to handle boundary checks.

- Suse's security advisory indicates the issue is considered moderate, with CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 and CVSSv2 score of 6.0.
