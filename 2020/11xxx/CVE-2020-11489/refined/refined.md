Based on the provided document, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2020-11489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of default SNMP community strings in the AMI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware of NVIDIA DGX servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Default SNMP community strings are used. This is a well-known security weakness, as these default strings are often publicly known or easily guessable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to information disclosure. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data through the SNMP protocol by using the default community strings.
*   The vulnerability also has a low potential impact on system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
*   The attack requires no special privileges (PR:N).
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs network access to the BMC of the DGX server.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system.

**CVSS v3.1 Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L
