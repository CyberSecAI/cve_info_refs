|  |  | title: Securing the Admin API |
|  |  | --- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # Overview |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Kong's Admin API provides a RESTful interface for administration and |
|  |  | configuration of APIs, plugins, consumers, and credentials. Because this |
|  |  | API allows full control of Kong, it is important to secure this API against |
|  |  | unwanted access. This document describes a few possible approaches to securing |
|  |  | the Admin API. |
|  |  |  |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Network Layer Access Restrictions |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Reduce Listening Footprint |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | By default, Kong will accept requests for both the public-facing entrypoint, and |
|  |  | the Admin API, on `0.0.0.0`, which will bind to all available interfaces on the |
|  |  | host. Reducing this exposure footprint by limiting the interfaces by which the |
|  |  | Admin API can be accessed is a foundational step. This setting can be adjusted |
|  |  | via the `admin\_listen` Kong configuration directive. For example: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | `admin\_listen 127.0.0.1:8001` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This will define the Nginx `listen` directive used by Kong to the prescribed |
|  |  | value, instructing Kong to only respond to requests received on the localhost |
|  |  | interface. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [Back to TOC](#table-of-contents) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Layer 3/4 Network Controls |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In cases where the Admin API must be exposed beyond a localhost interface, |
|  |  | network security best practices dictate that network-layer access be restricted |
|  |  | as much as possible. Consider an environment in which Kong listens on a private |
|  |  | network interface, but should only be accessed by a small subset of an IP range. |
|  |  | In such a case, host-based firewalls (e.g. iptables) are useful in limiting |
|  |  | input traffic ranges. For example: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```bash |
|  |  | # assume that Kong is listening on the address defined below, as defined as a |
|  |  | # /24 CIDR block, and only a select few hosts in this range should have access |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ grep admin\_listen /etc/kong/kong.conf |
|  |  | admin\_listen 10.10.10.3 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # explicitly allow TCP packets on port 8001 from the Kong node itself |
|  |  | # this is not necessary if Admin API requests are not sent from the node |
|  |  | $ iptables -A INPUT -s 10.10.10.3 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8001 -j ACCEPT |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # explicitly allow TCP packets on port 8001 from the following addresses |
|  |  | $ iptables -A INPUT -s 10.10.10.4 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8001 -j ACCEPT |
|  |  | $ iptables -A INPUT -s 10.10.10.5 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8001 -j ACCEPT |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # drop all TCP packets on port 8001 not in the above IP list |
|  |  | $ iptables -A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8001 -j DROP |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Additional controls, such as similar ACLs applied at a network device level, are |
|  |  | encouraged, but fall outside the scope of this document. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [Back to TOC](#table-of-contents) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Kong API Loopback |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Kong's routing design allows it to serve as a proxy for the Admin API itself. In |
|  |  | this manner, Kong itself can be used to provide fine-grained access control to |
|  |  | the Admin API. Such an environment requires bootstrapping a new API that defines |
|  |  | the `admin\_listen` address as the API's `upstream\_url`. For example: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```bash |
|  |  | # assume that Kong has defined admin\_listen as 127.0.0.1:8001, and we want to |
|  |  | # reach the Admin API via the url `/admin-api` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | $ curl http://localhost:8001/apis \ |
|  |  | --data name=admin-api \ |
|  |  | --data uris=/admin-api \ |
|  |  | --data upstream\_url=http://localhost:8001 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # we can now transparently reach the Admin API through the proxy server |
|  |  | $ curl localhost:8000/admin-api/apis |
|  |  | { |
|  |  | "data":[ |
|  |  | { |
|  |  | "uris":[ |
|  |  | "\/admin-api" |
|  |  | ], |
|  |  | "id":"653b21bd-4d81-4573-ba00-177cc0108dec", |
|  |  | "upstream\_read\_timeout":60000, |
|  |  | "preserve\_host":false, |
|  |  | "created\_at":1496351805000, |
|  |  | "upstream\_connect\_timeout":60000, |
|  |  | "upstream\_url":"http:\/\/localhost:8001", |
|  |  | "strip\_uri":true, |
|  |  | "https\_only":false, |
|  |  | "name":"admin-api", |
|  |  | "http\_if\_terminated":true, |
|  |  | "upstream\_send\_timeout":60000, |
|  |  | "retries":5 |
|  |  | } |
|  |  | ], |
|  |  | "total":1 |
|  |  | } |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | From here, simply apply desired Kong-specific security controls (such as |
|  |  | [basic][basic-auth] or [key authentication][key-auth], |
|  |  | [IP restrictions][ip-restriction], or [access control lists][acl]) as you would |
|  |  | normally to any other Kong API. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [Back to TOC](#table-of-contents) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Custom Nginx Configuration |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Kong is tightly coupled with Nginx as an HTTP daemon, and can thus be integrated |
|  |  | into environments with custom Nginx configurations. In this manner, use cases |
|  |  | with complex security/access control requirements can use the full power of |
|  |  | Nginx/OpenResty to build server/location blocks to house the Admin API as |
|  |  | necessary. This allows such environments to leverage native Nginx authorization |
|  |  | and authentication mechanisms, ACL modules, etc., in addition to providing the |
|  |  | OpenResty environment on which custom/complex security controls can be built. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For more information on integrating Kong into custom Nginx configurations, see |
|  |  | [Custom Nginx configuration & embedding Kong][custom-configuration]. |

**Kong** or **Kong API Gateway** is a cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable API Gateway distinguished for its high performance and extensibility via plugins. It also provides advanced AI capabilities with multi-LLM support.

By providing functionality for proxying, routing, load balancing, health checking, authentication (and [more](#features)), Kong serves as the central layer for orchestrating microservices or conventional API traffic with ease.

Kong runs natively on Kubernetes thanks to its official [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller).

---

## Getting Started

If you prefer to use a cloud-hosted Kong, you can [sign up for a free trial of Kong Konnect](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register?utm_medium=Referral&utm_source=Github&utm_campaign=kong-gateway&utm_content=konnect-promo-in-gateway&utm_term=get-started) and get started in minutes. If not, you can follow the instructions below to get started with Kong on your own infrastructure.

Let’s test drive Kong by adding authentication to an API in under 5 minutes.

We suggest using the docker-compose distribution via the instructions below, but there is also a [docker installation](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/install/docker/#install-kong-gateway-in-db-less-mode) procedure if you’d prefer to run the Kong API Gateway in DB-less mode.

Whether you’re running in the cloud, on bare metal, or using containers, you can find every supported distribution on our [official installation](https://konghq.com/install/#kong-community) page.

1. To start, clone the Docker repository and navigate to the compose folder.

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong
  $ cd docker-kong/compose/
```

2. Start the Gateway stack using:

```
  $ KONG_DATABASE=postgres docker-compose --profile database up
```

The Gateway is now available on the following ports on localhost:

* `:8000` - send traffic to your service via Kong
* `:8001` - configure Kong using Admin API or via [decK](https://github.com/kong/deck)
* `:8002` - access Kong's management Web UI ([Kong Manager](https://github.com/Kong/kong-manager)) on [localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)

Next, follow the [quick start guide](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/getting-started/configuring-a-service/) to tour the Gateway features.

## Features

By centralizing common API functionality across all your organization's services, the Kong API Gateway creates more freedom for engineering teams to focus on the challenges that matter most.

The top Kong features include:

* Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via a RESTful admin API or declarative configuration.
* Authentication and authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, OAuth, ACLs and more.
* Proxy, SSL/TLS termination, and connectivity support for L4 or L7 traffic.
* Plugins for enforcing traffic controls, rate limiting, req/res transformations, logging, monitoring and including a plugin developer hub.
* Plugins for AI traffic to support multi-LLM implementations and no-code AI use cases, with advanced AI prompt engineering, AI observability, AI security and more.
* Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.
* Native [ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller) support for serving Kubernetes.
