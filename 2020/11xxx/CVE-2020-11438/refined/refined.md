The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in LibreHealth EHR version 2.0.0. One of them is related to CVE-2020-11438.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The LibreHealth EHR application is affected by a systemic Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The application accepts POST requests sent from arbitrary origins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Systemic CSRF vulnerability: The application does not properly validate the origin of POST requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE): By chaining the CSRF vulnerability with a known insecure file upload vulnerability, an unauthenticated remote attacker can upload a malicious PHP script and execute it, leading to full server compromise.
- Escalation of privileges: An attacker can perform actions on behalf of authenticated users by tricking them into visiting a malicious webpage.
- Data breach: Exploitation of this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities allows for the potential exfiltration of sensitive medical records and personally identifiable information (PII) stored in the application's database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Phishing attacks: An attacker creates a malicious webpage that contains forged POST requests targeting the vulnerable application. When an authenticated user visits this page, the requests are executed by their browser within the application context, leading to the exploitation of vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a webpage that can be accessed by a victim user who is already authenticated to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication to the vulnerable application is required for the attacker.
