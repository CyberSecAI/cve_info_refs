Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11879:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the non-standard `attach` parameter within `mailto:` URIs in several email clients, specifically Evolution, Thunderbird, KMail and IBM Notes. This parameter, when present in a `mailto:` URI, can be used to attach local files to a composed email.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the implementation of a proprietary (non-RFC6068) `attach` parameter within the `mailto:` URI scheme by certain email clients. This parameter allows specifying local files to be attached to an email.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Attachment:** The main vulnerability is the ability to attach arbitrary files from the local filesystem to an email through a `mailto:` link.
*   **Lack of User Awareness/Confirmation:** In many cases, the attachment of files happens without clear user consent or notification, especially when combined with techniques like directory attachment or prepending multiple `attach` parameters to hide the critical attachment.
*   **Bypass of Warnings:** While some email clients show a warning for files beginning with a dot or located in `/etc`, this can be circumvented by attaching the whole directory or using wildcards.
*   **NTLM Hash Leak:** IBM Notes on Windows can be exploited to leak the user's NTLM hashes to an attacker-controlled SMB server when network share paths are used within the `attach` parameter.
*   **IMAP message attachment:** Thunderbird can be exploited to attach emails from the user's IMAP server using a custom `imap://` scheme, and also decrypt encrypted emails in the process of attachment
*   **Auto-saving Drafts:** Vulnerable email clients can automatically save drafts (including malicious attachments) to the IMAP "drafts" folder, which can be accessed by an attacker in certain scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive files (e.g., PGP private keys, SSH keys, configuration files, bitcoin wallets) from the victim's computer.
*   **Credential Theft:** NTLM hashes can be stolen, enabling further attacks on the victim's network.
*   **Deanonymization**: Access to IMAP emails may deanonymize users by showing their access to multiple email accounts.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Exfiltration of decrypted emails may leak sensitive information contained within.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Websites:** Attackers can embed malicious `mailto:` links with the `attach` parameter on a website.
*   **Malicious Documents:** Malicious documents (e.g., PDFs) can contain `mailto:` links with the `attach` parameter.
*   **Malicious Emails:** Attackers can use `mailto:` links in emails sent to the victim.
*  **Malicious IMAP server**: The attack can be performed by a malicious IMAP server with no user interaction using the auto-save drafts feature of vulnerable email clients

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Mailto Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to trigger a `mailto:` URI. This can be achieved by a malicious website, PDF document, or any other means to trigger mailto links.
* **Passive MitM (Optional):** The attacker may be a passive man-in-the-middle, with read access to the victim's IMAP server, to exfiltrate the attachments when the drafts are automatically saved.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click the `mailto:` link (or open a malicious file containing it), and may need to send the email in order to trigger the attack.
* **For NTLM Hash Leak:** The user must use IBM Notes on Windows and the attacker must control a SMB server.
* **For IMAP exfiltration:** The user must use Thunderbird, and the attacker must know the UIDs of the target emails.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content provides more details than the typical CVE description, including the specific attack vectors, the impact of exploiting the vulnerability and the affected email clients
*   The research paper linked provides additional context and details regarding this vulnerability, as well as other related vulnerabilities in email clients.
*   The issue is that the `attach` parameter is not part of the official `mailto` specification (RFC6068), yet certain email clients have chosen to implement it.
*   The paper also points out the dangers of auto-saving drafts to an IMAP server, which can be leveraged in combination with the `attach` parameter for exfiltration.

In summary, CVE-2020-11879 is a vulnerability that arises from the misuse of the proprietary `attach` parameter in `mailto:` URIs. This allows attackers to exfiltrate arbitrary files and leak NTLM credentials, highlighting the dangers of proprietary features and unexpected behavior within email clients.
