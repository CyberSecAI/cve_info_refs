The provided content relates to CVE-2020-11963.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of Bash Shell Metacharacter Injection and Incorrect Access Control in the web panel of IQrouter devices running firmware up to version 3.3.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Shell Metacharacter Injection:** The web panel's use of Bash shell allows for the injection of malicious metacharacters, leading to code execution.
2.  **Incorrect Access Control:** The `diag_set_password` and `reset_password` functions in the web panel allow remote attackers to arbitrarily change the root password.
3.  **Embedded Credentials:** The router has a default root account with an empty password which enables remote access via SSH without any prior authentication.
4.  **Incorrect Access Control (Device Control):** Remote attackers can control the device (restart network, reboot, upgrade, reset) without authorization.
5. **Incorrect Access Control (Log Disclosure):** The system logs are accessible to remote attackers without authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
*   Remote code execution with root privileges.
*   Denial of Service (DoS).
*   Escalation of privileges.
*   Information disclosure (including system logs and potentially email of IQrouter owner).
*   Full remote control of the router via SSH.
*   Arbitrary change of the root password.
*   Device control (restart network, reboot, upgrade, reset).

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities via the web panel of the IQrouter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the IQrouter remotely. No prior authentication is needed in some cases due to the lack of a default password.
