The provided content is related to CVE-2020-11685.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GoLand IDE was using plain HTTP to access the plugin repository.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of unencrypted HTTP protocol for communication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and intercept or modify the plugin data being transmitted. This could potentially allow the attacker to inject malicious plugins into the IDE.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, man-in-the-middle attack during communication between GoLand and the plugin repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the GoLand IDE and the plugin repository (e.g., being on the same network or controlling a network node).
