The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Although the advisory does not mention CVE-2020-11769, it does detail a vulnerability (PSV-2018-0518) that affects multiple Netgear router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The advisory identifies a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which means that malicious script can be injected and stored on the device and later executed by other users when they access the compromised area.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:** The advisory does not specify the exact impact, but stored XSS can lead to a variety of malicious actions:
- Account hijacking
- Data theft
- Redirecting users to malicious sites
- Defacement of the web interface

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the attacker injects the malicious script which gets stored in the device, usually through a vulnerable input field. The attack is executed when a user views the stored script through the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a vulnerable input field of the router's web interface. The advisory indicates that a high privilege is not necessary and the CVSS vector specifies local access.
