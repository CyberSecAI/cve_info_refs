Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11091:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2020-11091.  The advisory published by `weaveworks` explicitly mentions CVE-2020-11091. It describes a vulnerability related to IPv6 rogue router advertisements that can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. The commit diff shows the code changes made to mitigate the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that even in an IPv4-only cluster, if IPv6 is not completely disabled on the host, the host may still accept IPv6 router advertisements and configure its IPv6 stack accordingly. A malicious actor can send "rogue" router advertisements to redirect some or all of the host's IPv6 traffic to a container they control.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **IPv6 Router Advertisement Acceptance:** The primary weakness is that the host operating system, by default, accepts IPv6 router advertisements even when it's primarily using IPv4, and does not disable `accept_ra` on its network interfaces.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The host doesn't validate the source or authenticity of IPv6 router advertisements, trusting them implicitly.
*   **CAP_NET_RAW Capability:** The use of `CAP_NET_RAW` capability by containers allows the containers to perform network operations such as sending router advertisements.
*   **DNS Resolution Behavior:** Many HTTP libraries will attempt to connect via IPv6 first if an AAAA record is returned by DNS, creating an opportunity for the attacker even if IPv6 is not actively used.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept traffic intended for other services by acting as a rogue IPv6 router, redirecting network traffic to their own controlled container.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Possible):** The advisory notes that if combined with other vulnerabilities (such as the `apt` vulnerability CVE-2019-3462), the attacker could escalate privileges from the container to the host system.
*   **Service Impersonation:**  The attacker's container, acting as a rogue router, can also respond to DNS requests, inserting itself as a fake service and intercepting communications intended for the real service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Rogue Router Advertisements:** The attacker sends crafted IPv6 router advertisements.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run a container with `CAP_NET_RAW` capability on the same network as the victim host.
*   **DNS Spoofing**: The attacker can use their position on the network to inject their own address via DNS.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Root Privileges Inside a Container:** The attacker needs to be able to run a process as root inside a container.
*   **CAP_NET_RAW Capability:** The attacker's container must have the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability.
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker's container needs to be on the same network as the target host and/or service.

**Mitigation:**

The fix implemented in Weave Net 2.6.3 and later disables the `accept_ra` option on the veth devices created by Weave Net.  This prevents the host from accepting the rogue router advertisements.  Additionally, the advisory recommends not running containers with `CAP_NET_RAW` capability.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided commit diff shows the code changes to disable `accept_ra` for veth interfaces created by weave, using sysctl calls.
