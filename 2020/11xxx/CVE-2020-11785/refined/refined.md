The provided content is related to CVE-2020-11785.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the web interface of several NETGEAR routers, gateways, and WiFi systems. This means malicious script can be stored within the device configuration and executed when an administrator accesses the affected page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Account hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Modification of router settings
    - Potentially further network compromise

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected NETGEAR devices. An attacker would need to inject malicious script into a field that gets stored and later rendered within the administrative interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to access the web administration interface of the affected NETGEAR device and be logged in, or somehow have an injected script executed within the admin's session.
- The CVSS vector indicates high privileges are required for exploitation (PR:H).
