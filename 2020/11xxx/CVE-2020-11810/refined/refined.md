    "CVE-2020-11810": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists in OpenVPN where a data channel packet with a victim's peer-id can be injected before the data channel crypto parameters are initialized.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The peer-id float checks are not performed correctly during the time between peer-id allocation and data channel key initialization.",
        "The tls_pre_decrypt() function sets the packet length to zero if the data channel key isn't initialized.",
        "The openvpn_decrypt() function returns true if the packet length is zero.",
        "The process_incoming_link_part1() returns true, which triggers a float commit if a packet with zero length is processed and 'floated' flag is true"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id causing the victim's connection to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Injecting a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet with a victim's peer-id from a different IP address.",
        "The attack must occur during a small time window between the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response back to the client."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the victim's peer-id and must be able to send packets to the OpenVPN server during the small timing window after the victim's connection has started but before the data channel is fully initialized.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability only works if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use. The attacker can not inject or steal VPN traffic from the other session, this is a denial of service vulnerability."
