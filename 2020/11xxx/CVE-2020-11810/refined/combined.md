An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker can
inject a data channel v2 (P\_DATA\_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id.
Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before the
data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim's
connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the small
time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim client
connection starting and the server PUSH\_REPLY response back to the client.
This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use.

# [[Openvpn-devel] [PATCH v2] Fix illegal client float](/search?l=openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net&q=subject:%22%5C%5BOpenvpn%5C-devel%5C%5D+%5C%5BPATCH+v2%5C%5D+Fix+illegal+client+float%22&o=newest)

[Lev Stipakov](/search?l=openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net&q=from:%22Lev+Stipakov%22)
[Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:32:28 -0700](/search?l=openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net&q=date:20200415)

```
From: Lev Stipakov <l...@openvpn.net>

There is a time frame between allocating peer-id and initializing data
channel key, which is performed on receiving push request.
```
```

If a "rogue" data channel packet arrives during that time frame from
another address and  with same peer-id, this would cause client to float
to that new address. This is because:

 - tls_pre_decrypt() sets packet length to zero if
   data channel key has not been initialized, which leads to

 - openvpn_decrypt() returns true if packet length is zero,
which leads to

 - process_incoming_link_part1() returns true, which
calls multi_process_float(), which commits float

Note that problem doesn't happen when data channel key
is initialized, since in this case openvpn_decrypt() returns false.

Fix illegal float by adding buffer length check before calling
multi_process_float().

This should fix Trac #1272.

Signed-off-by: Lev Stipakov <l...@openvpn.net>

## Description

An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P\_DATA\_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim's connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH\_REPLY response back to the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use.

## Commit Message

```

From: Lev Stipakov <lev@openvpn.net>

There is a time frame between allocating peer-id and initializing data
channel key, which is performed on receiving push request.

If a "rogue" data channel packet arrives during that time frame from
another address and  with same peer-id, this would cause client to float
to that new address. This is because:

 - tls_pre_decrypt() sets packet length to zero if
   data channel key has not been initialized, which leads to

 - openvpn_decrypt() returns true if packet length is zero,
which leads to

 - process_incoming_link_part1() returns true, which
calls multi_process_float(), which commits float

Note that problem doesn't happen when data channel key
is initialized, since in this case openvpn_decrypt() returns false.

Fix illegal float by adding buffer length check before calling
multi_process_float().

This should fix Trac #1272.

just went through the entire flow with Lev and David and this all makes
a lot of sense now. Couldn't come up with a better fix for this issue.

Your patch has been applied to the master and release/2.4 branch (bugfix).

I have amended the commit message to make it more clear what is the
risk (DoS against another random user of the same server, but no traffic
injection or stealing)

Code change is "obviously correct".  Have still given it a t_client
run for good measure :-)

An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim's connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response back to the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1963967#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2021-05-24 14:01:13 UTC  ``` Created openvpn tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1963969](show_bug.cgi?id=1963969 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2020-11810 openvpn: race condition between allocating peer-id and initializing data channel key [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1963968](show_bug.cgi?id=1963968 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-11810 openvpn: race condition between allocating peer-id and initializing data channel key [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1963967#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-05-24 17:32:07 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

Fix illegal client float ([CVE-2020-11810](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6crj-vqv7-qq9r "CVE-2020-11810"))

```
There is a time frame between allocating peer-id and initializing data
channel key (which is performed on receiving push request or on async
push-reply) in which the existing peer-id float checks do not work right.

If a "rogue" data channel packet arrives during that time frame from
another address and  with same peer-id, this would cause client to float
to that new address. This is because:

 - tls_pre_decrypt() sets packet length to zero if
   data channel key has not been initialized, which leads to

 - openvpn_decrypt() returns true if packet length is zero,
   which leads to

 - process_incoming_link_part1() returns true, which
   calls multi_process_float(), which commits float

Note that problem doesn't happen when data channel key is initialized,
since in this case openvpn_decrypt() returns false.

The net effect of this behaviour is that the VPN session for the
"victim client" is broken.  Since the "attacker client" does not have
suitable keys, it can not inject or steal VPN traffic from the other
session.  The time window is small and it can not be used to attack
a specific client's session, unless some other way is found to make it
disconnect and reconnect first.

[CVE-2020-11810](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6crj-vqv7-qq9r "CVE-2020-11810") has been assigned to acknowledge this risk.

Fix illegal float by adding buffer length check ("is this packet still
considered valid") before calling multi_process_float().

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-969414e05b
2020-05-03 04:40:20.140402
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openvpn
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 2.4.9
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <https://community.openvpn.net/>
Summary : A full-featured SSL VPN solution
Description :
OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible tunneling application that uses all
of the encryption, authentication, and certification features of the
OpenSSL library to securely tunnel IP networks over a single UDP or TCP
port. It can use the Marcus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumers LZO library
for compression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Update to latest upstream OpenVPN 2.4.9 release. It contains a security fix for
CVE-2020-11810. This security issue is quite hard to abuse, requiring a fairly
precise timing attack combined with guessing a just assigned peer-id reference.
If successful, only a single client just initiating a new connection will
experience a denial of service situation. This wi why the severity is rated
low.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Sun Apr 19 2020 David Sommerseth dazo@eurephia.org - 2.4.9-1
- Update to upstream OpenVPN 2.4.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update can be installed with the "dnf" update program. Use
su -c 'dnf upgrade --advisory FEDORA-2020-969414e05b' at the command
line. For more information, refer to the dnf documentation available at
<http://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#upgrade-command-label>

All packages are signed with the Fedora Project GPG key. More details on the
GPG keys used by the Fedora Project can be found at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1169925#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-04-20 14:25:19 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-11810  There is a time frame between allocating peer-id and initializing data channel key (which is performed on receiving push request or on async push-reply) in which the existing peer-id float checks do not work right.  If a "rogue" data channel packet arrives during that time frame from another address and  with same peer-id, this would cause client to float to that new address. This is because:   - tls_pre_decrypt() sets packet length to zero if    data channel key has not been initialized, which leads to   - openvpn_decrypt() returns true if packet length is zero,    which leads to   - process_incoming_link_part1() returns true, which    calls multi_process_float(), which commits float  Note that problem doesn't happen when data channel key is initialized, since in this case openvpn_decrypt() returns false.  The net effect of this behaviour is that the VPN session for the "victim client" is broken.  Since the "attacker client" does not have suitable keys, it can not inject or steal VPN traffic from the other session.  The time window is small and it can not be used to attack a specific client's session, unless some other way is found to make it disconnect and reconnect first.  CVE-2020-11810 has been assigned to acknowledge this risk.  Fix illegal float by adding buffer length check ("is this packet still considered valid") before calling multi_process_float().

# CVE-2020-11810

| **Name** | CVE-2020-11810 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P\_DATA\_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim's connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH\_REPLY response back to the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use. |

CVE ID         : CVE-2017-12166 CVE-2020-11810 CVE-2020-15078 CVE-2022-0547

Several issues were discovered in OpenVPN, a Virtual Private Network server
and client, that could lead to authentication bypass when using deferred
auth plugins.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1169925#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-04-20 14:25:19 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-11810  There is a time frame between allocating peer-id and initializing data channel key (which is performed on receiving push request or on async push-reply) in which the existing peer-id float checks do not work right.  If a "rogue" data channel packet arrives during that time frame from another address and  with same peer-id, this would cause client to float to that new address. This is because:   - tls_pre_decrypt() sets packet length to zero if    data channel key has not been initialized, which leads to   - openvpn_decrypt() returns true if packet length is zero,    which leads to   - process_incoming_link_part1() returns true, which    calls multi_process_float(), which commits float  Note that problem doesn't happen when data channel key is initialized, since in this case openvpn_decrypt() returns false.  The net effect of this behaviour is that the VPN session for the "victim client" is broken.  Since the "attacker client" does not have suitable keys, it can not inject or steal VPN traffic from the other session.  The time window is small and it can not be used to attack a specific client's session, unless some other way is found to make it disconnect and reconnect first.  CVE-2020-11810 has been assigned to acknowledge this risk.  Fix illegal float by adding buffer length check ("is this packet still considered valid") before calling multi_process_float().

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-11810 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11810)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P\_DATA\_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim's connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH\_REPLY response back to the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-c1cb4ebcd9
2020-04-29 02:13:31.168514
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : openvpn
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 2.4.9
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <https://community.openvpn.net/>
Summary : A full-featured SSL VPN solution
Description :
OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible tunneling application that uses all
of the encryption, authentication, and certification features of the
OpenSSL library to securely tunnel IP networks over a single UDP or TCP
port. It can use the Marcus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumers LZO library
for compression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Update to latest upstream OpenVPN 2.4.9 release. It contains a security fix for
CVE-2020-11810. This security issue is quite hard to abuse, requiring a fairly
precise timing attack combined with guessing a just assigned peer-id reference.
If successful, only a single client just initiating a new connection will
experience a denial of service situation. This wi why the severity is rated
low.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Sun Apr 19 2020 David Sommerseth dazo@eurephia.org - 2.4.9-1
- Update to upstream OpenVPN 2.4.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update can be installed with the "dnf" update program. Use
su -c 'dnf upgrade --advisory FEDORA-2020-c1cb4ebcd9' at the command
line. For more information, refer to the dnf documentation available at
<http://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#upgrade-command-label>

All packages are signed with the Fedora Project GPG key. More details on the
GPG keys used by the Fedora Project can be found at
<https://fedoraproject.org/keys>

# [[Openvpn-devel] [PATCH v2] Fix illegal client float](/search?l=openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net&q=subject:%22%5C%5BOpenvpn%5C-devel%5C%5D+%5C%5BPATCH+v2%5C%5D+Fix+illegal+client+float%22&o=newest)

[Lev Stipakov](/search?l=openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net&q=from:%22Lev+Stipakov%22)
[Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:32:28 -0700](/search?l=openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net&q=date:20200415)

```
From: Lev Stipakov <l...@openvpn.net>

There is a time frame between allocating peer-id and initializing data
channel key, which is performed on receiving push request.
```
```

If a "rogue" data channel packet arrives during that time frame from
another address and  with same peer-id, this would cause client to float
to that new address. This is because:

 - tls_pre_decrypt() sets packet length to zero if
   data channel key has not been initialized, which leads to

 - openvpn_decrypt() returns true if packet length is zero,
which leads to

 - process_incoming_link_part1() returns true, which
calls multi_process_float(), which commits float

Note that problem doesn't happen when data channel key
is initialized, since in this case openvpn_decrypt() returns false.

Fix illegal float by adding buffer length check before calling
multi_process_float().

This should fix Trac #1272.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
