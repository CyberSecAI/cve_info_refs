The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple router, gateway, and WiFi system models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The advisory states there is a stored cross-site scripting security vulnerability on various Netgear product models. The specific nature of the vulnerability (how the XSS is stored or triggered) is not detailed in this document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability remains if the recommended firmware update is not performed. However, the impact of successful exploitation (e.g. unauthorized access, data theft, malicious actions) is not specifically detailed in this advisory. The CVSS score implies the impact includes high confidentiality and integrity impact, but no impact to availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The advisory does not specify the exact method to trigger the XSS vulnerability. The CVSS vector indicates the attack can occur locally (AV:L), with a low complexity (AC:L) and requires high privileges (PR:H). User interaction is not required (UI:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would require high privileges, likely administrative access to the affected device to inject the malicious script for persistent exploitation.

**Affected devices (with vulnerable firmware versions):**
- D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.56
- R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.46
