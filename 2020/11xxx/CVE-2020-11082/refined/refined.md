Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11082

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided parameters used in generating pagination links within the Kaminari gem. Specifically, the `original_script_name` parameter was not included in the list of parameters to be excluded during the generation of pagination URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the generated pagination links, leading to potential XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code injection: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages containing pagination links generated by the Kaminari gem.
- XSS attacks:  The injected script can execute within the user's browser context, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL parameters: An attacker can craft a URL containing the `original_script_name` parameter with malicious code. When the application uses Kaminari to generate pagination links, this code is included in the links.
- User interaction: The crafted URL needs to be visited by a victim, either through a direct link or by embedding it in a malicious website or email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft URLs with specific parameters.
- Ability to induce a user to visit the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Kaminari versions `<= 1.2.0`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `1.2.1` by adding `original_script_name` to the list of excluded parameters.
- A workaround is available for users who cannot immediately update the gem by overriding the `PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST` constant within their application.
- Debian has issued security advisories (DSA-5005-1 and DLA-2763-1) to address this vulnerability for affected releases.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Moderate" severity.
