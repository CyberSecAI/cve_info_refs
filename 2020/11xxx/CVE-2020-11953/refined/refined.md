Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-11953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the NTP server setting field in the web interface of Rittal's PDU and CMC III devices. Specifically, when a user attempts to modify the NTP server IP address, the provided input is not correctly handled, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Arbitrary commands can be inserted into the NTP server IP address field.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Since the command is executed as root, a low-privileged user (e.g., 'pdu' or 'admin') can execute commands with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with root privileges. This can lead to:
    *   Full system compromise.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Malware installation.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Lateral movement within the network

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of Rittal PDU and CMC III devices.
*   The attacker needs to access the web interface with valid low privileged credentials (e.g., 'pdu' or 'admin').
*   The attacker then manipulates the request sent to the web server when changing the NTP server settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires network access to the device's web interface.
*   The attacker needs valid login credentials for the web interface (e.g., 'pdu' or 'admin').
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a web proxy like Burp Suite).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab
*   The issue is fixed in PDU firmware version V5.15.40 and CMC III firmware version V3.15.70\_4
*   The advisory mentions that the PDU is not updated regularly, which makes this vulnerability a potential risk
