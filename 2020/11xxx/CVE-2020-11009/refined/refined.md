Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-11009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient authorization checks in the Rundeck API allowed authenticated users to access data and logs they were not authorized to view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Authenticated users could craft requests to access execution data, logs, job details, and other resources by manipulating IDs, bypassing access controls.
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** Certain API endpoints failed to properly verify if the requesting user had the necessary permissions (`read`, `view`, `export`, etc.) to access the requested resources.
- Specifically, the following were vulnerable:
  - Accessing job executions and logs without `read` or `view` access to the associated job.
  - Retrieving a list of running executions without `read` access to events.
  - Viewing job option definitions or workflow steps without access to the Job.
  - Viewing SCM diff of a modified Job definition without Project `export` access.
  - Viewing a New User Profile form for a different user without `admin` access.
  - Accessing Plugin Input Parameters for a SCM plugin without authorization for `import`, `scm_import`, `export`, or `scm_export` actions.
  - Retrying job executions without `read` or `view` access to the Execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information such as:
  - Execution data and logs.
  - Job definitions and configurations.
  - Workflow steps.
  - Job Option definitions.
  - SCM diffs of modified Job definitions
  - Potentially sensitive data, secrets, or intellectual property exposed in Rundeck execution outputs and job data
- The severity of the impact depends on the Rundeck configuration and how it's used, ranging from low risk in tightly restricted environments to high risk when access is broadly granted and sensitive information is exposed in execution outputs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted API Requests: Attackers exploit vulnerable API endpoints by crafting malicious requests to access unauthorized resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must have a valid account on the Rundeck system.
- Knowledge of API Endpoints: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoints and be able to craft requests that bypass authorization checks.
