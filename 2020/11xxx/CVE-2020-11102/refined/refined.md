Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-11102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking in the Tulip network interface card (NIC) emulator within QEMU. Specifically, when copying data to and from the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) frame buffers, the code does not verify if the frame size exceeds the allocated buffer length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Write:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The `tulip_copy_tx_buffers` function and `tulip_copy_rx_bytes` function fail to ensure that data written to the TX/RX buffers does not exceed their boundaries.
*   **Potential for Infinite Loop:** The `tulip_xmit_list_update` function iterates over descriptors to process them, and this process may lead to an infinite loop because the iteration isn't limited or checked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote user/process could trigger this flaw causing QEMU to crash.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system with the privileges of the QEMU process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during network data transfer operations handled by the emulated Tulip NIC.
*   A remote attacker or a malicious process could send specially crafted network data to the emulated guest machine to trigger this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send or manipulate network traffic that is processed by the vulnerable QEMU instance.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be local to the QEMU host, remote exploitation is possible.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix includes adding checks to `tulip_copy_tx_buffers` and `tulip_copy_rx_bytes` to ensure the data length does not exceed the size of the buffers.
*   A limit to the number of iterations in the `tulip_xmit_list_update` function was added to prevent the potential infinite loop.
*   The receive function `tulip_receive` also got an update to check the incoming size is not larger than the frame buffer size

**Additional Notes**

* The provided information includes patches for the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability affects QEMU versions prior to 4.2.0-r5 (according to Gentoo advisory GLSA 202005-02).
* The vulnerability was reported by Ziming Zhang and Li Qiang of Ant Financial.
