Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-11838

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is not explicitly stated but is inferred to be related to improper input sanitization or handling within the ArcSight Management Center application, which allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored within the application and executed when other users interact with the affected parts of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability could lead to:
    *   Malicious script execution in the context of another user's session.
    *   Potential session hijacking or credential theft.
    *   Defacement or alteration of the application's content seen by users.
    *   Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.
*   **Injection of malicious scripts:** The attacker needs to find a way to insert the malicious script into the system by using a vulnerable input or function of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the ArcSight Management Center application.
*   **User Interaction:** For the stored XSS to execute, another user has to interact with the affected part of the application where the malicious script is stored.
*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not need specific privileges to inject malicious script, as long as a vulnerable function is available for use.
*   **User Interaction:** The CVSS vector implies that User Interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document specifies that this vulnerability exists in versions 2.6.1, 2.7.x, 2.8.x, 2.9.x prior to 2.9.4 of ArcSight Management Center.
*   The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by ING Tech Poland.
*   A patch or upgrade to version 2.9.4 (or later) of ArcSight Management Center resolves the vulnerability.
