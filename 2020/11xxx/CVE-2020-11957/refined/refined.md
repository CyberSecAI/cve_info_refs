This is because the random number generation procedure used for generating Na/Nb during pairing was incorrectly generating a 64-bit random number instead of the required 128-bit random number as defined by the Bluetooth Specification. This could allow an attacker within range to potentially pair with a device using a more predictable key. The attacker would need to be within wireless range of the vulnerable device."
