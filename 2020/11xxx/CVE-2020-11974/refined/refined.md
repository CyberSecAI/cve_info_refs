Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-11974:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content includes a message with the subject "CVE-2024-31864: Apache Zeppelin: Remote code execution by adding malicious JDBC connection string". This is the correct CVE identifier.
   - It references ZEPPELIN-5990, which is also present in the provided information

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is an "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')" vulnerability within Apache Zeppelin.
   - Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing JDBC connection strings. An attacker can inject malicious code or sensitive configuration through the JDBC URL.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

   - **Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization or validation of user inputs used in the JDBC URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, commands, or configurations.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

    -  **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code into the JDBC connection string, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server where Apache Zeppelin is running.
    - **Sensitive Configuration Exposure:** Attackers could potentially inject configurations to gain access to sensitive data or systems.
    
**5. Attack vectors:**

   - The primary attack vector is through the JDBC interpreter configuration where a user can specify the JDBC connection string.
   - An attacker would need to manipulate or supply a malicious JDBC URL via a Zeppelin configuration.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

    - The attacker needs to have the ability to configure a JDBC connection within Apache Zeppelin.
    - This could potentially be via the Zeppelin UI, API, or configuration files (depending on the specific attack path).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Apache Zeppelin version 0.11.1, and users are advised to upgrade.
- The related Jira issue is ZEPPELIN-5990.
- The fix involved disabling certain sensitive configurations for JDBC URLs.
