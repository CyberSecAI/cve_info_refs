The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the maccms v10 software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user input when accepting POST data during the user information saving process and when displaying user information. Specifically, the `nickname` field is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not filter or encode user-supplied data (specifically the nickname) when saving or displaying it.
- Stored XSS: The malicious payload is stored in the database and executed when the affected user profile page is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser (e.g., administrator or user).
- Potential for session hijacking, account takeover, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the XSS payload into the user's nickname field during the user profile edit.
- The XSS is triggered when an administrator views/edits the user's profile.
- The XSS is triggered when the affected user logs in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access and modify user profile information in the backend. An attacker with administrative privileges or a compromised user account with editing access can exploit the vulnerability.
