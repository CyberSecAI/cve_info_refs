The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the IBOS open-source office automation system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the `emailbody[content]` parameter when sending emails. Specifically, the application fails to filter or encode special characters, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the `emailbody[content]` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `emailbody[content]` parameter before displaying it, allowing for the execution of injected JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email body. This allows the attacker to perform various actions within the context of the victim's browser session, such as:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Steal the victim's cookies, potentially gaining access to their account.
  - **Data exfiltration:** Steal sensitive information.
  - **Defacement:** Modify the appearance of the web page.
  - **Malicious Actions:** Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, such as sending further emails.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email Injection:** An attacker can send a crafted email with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `emailbody[content]` parameter.
- **Network Manipulation:** The attacker can intercept and modify the HTTP request of the email submission, injecting the malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the IBOS system to send emails.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- **Packet Capture/Manipulation Tool:** The attacker needs to be able to capture and modify HTTP requests, such as using a proxy tool.

**Additional details from content:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `emailbody[content]` within the email sending functionality.
- The example exploit uses `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` as the payload, which demonstrates cookie stealing.
- The vulnerability was tested on IBOS version 4.5.4, running on Windows OS.
- The report suggests encoding special characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`, and `%` and filtering keywords like `script` and `javascript` or filter Javascript event handlers to prevent the vulnerability.
