## Description

![@T3qui1a](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17540142?u=9c369adae725000f5eeb1300bb9fa77764bdd0b7&v=4&size=48)[T3qui1a](https://github.com/T3qui1a)opened [on Oct 31, 2019](https://github.com/Kliqqi-CMS/Kliqqi-CMS/issues/259#issue-515291262)

This is a SQL Injection vulerable in "admin\_update\_module\_widgets.php" file.

At line 47, "$recordIDValue" Parameters are not wrapped in single quotes. And the parameters also are not safely processed.

When you have installed modules. There is a time-based sql injection.(If the tables didn't exists datas, time-based didn't work)
