Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. It's located in the user addition functionality after logging into the backend of GreenCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:** The web application does not properly validate or protect against CSRF attacks when adding a new user. The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates this weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to add a new administrator account to the GreenCMS system.
*   This could grant the attacker full control over the CMS, allowing them to modify content, install malicious plugins, steal data, or completely take over the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is by crafting a malicious HTML page or script (like the provided `<script>`) that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, will trigger the user addition functionality. This malicious page can be hosted anywhere.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the GreenCMS system.
*   The attacker needs to trick an already logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing emails, or by compromising a website the administrator frequently visits.
* The attacker is required to know the general structure of the HTTP request needed to add an administrator, but they do not need to know specific anti-CSRF tokens.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (POC) script: `<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>`. While this script itself might not trigger the user addition, it's included to suggest a CSRF attack. This suggests the lack of CSRF token verification and/or other anti-CSRF measures on the user addition endpoint.
*   The issue was reported in 2019.

This analysis goes into more detail than the placeholder CVE description, outlining the specific nature of the CSRF vulnerability and how it might be exploited.
