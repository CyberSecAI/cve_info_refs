- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'email' parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the 'email' parameter in the `forgot_password.php` page via an HTTP POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application, no authentication required for the `forgot_password.php` page.
