Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the `admin.php/admin/type/info.html` endpoint of the `maccms10` application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **CSRF:** The application doesn't implement proper CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by an authenticated administrator, can perform actions on the application. In this case, it modifies the 'english name' of a category.
2.  **XSS:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it back in the admin interface. Specifically, the `type_en` parameter is vulnerable to XSS, where the provided HTML payload is injected without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
1. **CSRF:** Force an authenticated admin user to modify category names by submitting a crafted form via the admin panel.
2. **XSS:** Inject malicious JavaScript into the admin panel, leading to arbitrary code execution within the admin's browser session. The specific example demonstrates stealing the admin user's cookies using `alert(document.cookie)`, thus gaining full access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a POST request to `/admin.php/admin/type/info.html`. This form is designed to modify the `type_en` field with the XSS payload.
2. **XSS:** Once the admin views the modified category name in the admin interface, the injected JavaScript payload is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into opening the crafted HTML page (CSRF).
2. The attacker needs a working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious form and the XSS payload.
3. The target needs to be logged in to the admin interface for the attack to succeed.

**Details beyond CVE description:**
The provided content offers a specific and detailed example of the exploit, showing a sample HTML form that includes the XSS payload within the type_en field as well as the necessary hidden inputs to complete the form submission. It also includes a screenshot of the XSS payload being rendered in the admin panel, which further confirms the XSS vulnerability.
