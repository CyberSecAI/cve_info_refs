Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input, specifically within the title field of the CMS. The application fails to sanitize or encode the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts are stored in the database and then executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to steal the user's `JEECMS-Auth-Token` and cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
- **Data theft:** Attackers can potentially access and steal sensitive information stored in the application's database or within the browser.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim, including modifying data, making unauthorized purchases, or spreading malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Field:** The primary attack vector is through the `title` field in the `member-vipcenter.htm` page.
- **Payload:** The attacker inserts a malicious script using the `<svg/onload=alert(1)>` payload or similar within the vulnerable input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the JEECMS system with the ability to modify content (e.g., post).
- **Access to Vulnerable Page:** The attacker must have access to the `member-vipcenter.htm` to trigger the XSS.

**Additional details:**

- The attacker is using the `<svg>` tag with the `onload` attribute to execute JavaScript code.
- The payload can be used to steal the authentication token and cookies.
- The vulnerability is located in `ContentFrontServiceImpl.class`, `ContentContributeDto.class`, and `Content.class`
