Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the Metinfo 7.0.0beta CMS. Specifically, the `langconfig` parameter in the `/metinfo/7.0beta/admin/?n=language&c=language_web&a=doAddLanguage` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `langconfig` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   **Potential Data Breach/Modification:** This could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data within the database. The provided example uses `sleep(10)` which could cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **`langconfig` parameter:** The malicious SQL injection is placed within the `langconfig` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator in the Metinfo CMS.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running Metinfo CMS.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/metinfo/7.0beta/admin/?n=language&c=language_web&a=doAddLanguage`.
*   The injection occurs through the `langconfig` parameter in the POST data.
*   A sample payload is provided:
   ```
   langconfig=1%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,sleep(10)%23
   ```
*   The attacker sends the above payload along with other POST data. The other parameters are not used in the SQL injection, but they are needed to make the request pass validation checks. The attack can be successful using other combinations of parameters, but the `order` and `mask` columns are needed.
