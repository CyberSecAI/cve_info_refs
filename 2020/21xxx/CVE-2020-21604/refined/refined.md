Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow that occurs during the decoding process of H.265 video files. Specifically, the issue arises in the `_mm_loadl_epi64` function within the `ff_hevc_put_hevc_epel_pixels_8_sse` function, which is related to motion compensation calculations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs when the code attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size on the heap. In this case, the `_mm_loadl_epi64` intrinsic attempts to read 8 bytes from a memory location that is outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the decoding process due to the memory access violation. This leads to denial of service.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the content of the overflow. The provided ASan output shows the memory corruption happening in a low-level SSE instruction. If an attacker can precisely craft the input stream to control this memory corruption, it's theoretically possible to overwrite critical data on the heap to achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted H.265 video file:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted H.265 video file. The attacker can achieve this by crafting a video file that, when decoded, leads to out-of-bounds memory access in the specified location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable `libde265` library with a malicious H.265 video file. This could be achieved through various means depending on the specific application that utilizes `libde265`. The attacker would not need access to the system other than the ability to provide the video file as an input to a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided ASan output shows the exact location of the crash and the call stack, making debugging and patching this issue much easier. It also shows that the overflow happens 80 bytes beyond the allocated memory region.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 5346-1) confirms that this CVE is among a large set of vulnerabilities that have been fixed in version 1.0.11-0+deb11u1, indicating the severity and number of issues in earlier versions.
- The issue was found via fuzzing, which is a common method to identify memory corruption issues.
