LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.

#### Inim Electronics Smartliving SmartLAN/G/SI <=6.x Hard-coded Credentials

Title: Inim Electronics Smartliving SmartLAN/G/SI <=6.x Hard-coded Credentials

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2019-5546](ZSL-2019-5546.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: System Access, DoS

Risk: (4/5)

Release Date: 09.12.2019
##### Summary

SmartLiving anti-intrusion control panel and security system provides
important features rarely found in residential, commercial or industrial application
systems of its kind. This optimized-performance control panel provides first-rate
features such as: graphic display, text-to-speech, voice notifier, flexible hardware,
end-to-end voice transmission (voice-on-bus), IP connectivity.

SMARTLAN/SI:
The system-on-chip platform used in the SmartLAN/SI accessory board provides point-to-point
networking capability and fast connectivity to the Internet. Therefore, it is possible
to set up a remote connection and program or control the system via the SmartLeague
software application. In effect, the SmartLAN/SI board grants the same level of access
to the system as a local RS232 connection.

SMARTLAN/G:
The SmartLAN/G board operates in the same way as the SmartLAN/SI but in addition provides
advanced remote-access and communication functions. The SmartLAN/G board is capable of
sending event-related e-mails automatically. Each e-mail can be associated with a subject,
an attachment and a text message. The attachment can be of any kind and is saved to an
SD card. The message text can contain direct links to domains or IP addressable devices,
such as a security cameras. In addition to e-mails, the SmartLAN/G board offers users
global access to their control panels via any Internet browser accessed through a PC,
PDA or Smartphone. In fact, the SmartLAN/G has an integrated web-server capable of
distinguishing the means of connection and as a result provides an appropriate web-page
for the tool in use. Smartphones can control the system in much the same way as a
household keypad, from inside the house or from any part of the world.
##### Description

The devices utilizes hard-coded credentials within its Linux distribution image.
These sets of credentials (Telnet, SSH, FTP) are never exposed to the end-user and cannot
be changed through any normal operation of the smart home device. Attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by logging in and gain system access.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
