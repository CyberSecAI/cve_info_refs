Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the Linux distribution image of Inim Electronics Smartliving SmartLAN/G/SI devices. These credentials, which are for Telnet, SSH, and FTP, are not exposed to end-users and cannot be changed through normal device operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of static, unchangeable credentials within the device's firmware.
*   **Lack of User Control:** End-users cannot modify or change these default credentials, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **System Access:** Successful exploitation grants attackers unauthorized access to the system via Telnet, SSH, or FTP.
*   **Full Control:** The attacker gains the same level of control as a local RS232 connection.
*   **Potential for DoS:** The advisory mentions Denial of Service (DoS) as a possible impact, though the method isn't specified it can likely result from the control gained by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network via Telnet, SSH, or FTP. This could be from the local network or via the internet if the devices are exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target device.
*   **Credential Knowledge:** The attacker must be aware of the hardcoded credentials (which are found in the /etc/passwd file).
