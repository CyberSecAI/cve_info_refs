  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The GIF loader in libsixel does not properly check the LZW code size, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A maliciously crafted GIF image can cause a stack buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted GIF file to the `img2sixel` tool.",

          "commit": "7808a06b88c11dbc502318cdd51fa374f8cd47ee",
          "description": "The fix introduces a check for the LZW code size. If the code size is greater than the maximum allowed, an error is returned and processing is stopped."
        }
      ],
  "details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `gif_process_raster` function within `fromgif.c`. Specifically, the LZW minimum code size (lzw_cs) read from the GIF file is not validated against the maximum allowed code size (gif_lzw_max_code_size). If a crafted GIF provides a `lzw_cs` value greater than `gif_lzw_max_code_size`, the code attempts to write to an out-of-bounds memory location on the stack via the `g->codes` array, resulting in a stack buffer overflow."
