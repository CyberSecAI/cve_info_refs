Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-21161 (based on the provided blog content, although the CVE description is a placeholder)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization on a POST parameter within the Ruckus Wireless ZoneDirector product. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to neutralize or encode user-supplied input before rendering it in the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Stealing user cookies and session tokens, leading to account takeover.
  - Impersonating the user and modifying the content of the page presented to the user.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Potentially exploiting browser vulnerabilities (although not demonstrated).
  - Performing phishing attacks by displaying fake login pages.
  - Stealing user information.
  - Injecting malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the vulnerable Ruckus Wireless ZoneDirector application. The malicious payload is injected into a URL parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable application. This means the attacker would have to be able to reach the application on the network, which could be an internal network or a reachable interface if it is exposed to the internet.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious XSS payload and inject it into the vulnerable parameter.
- The attacker needs to know the parameter which is vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable version is specified as Ruckus Wireless version 9.8.3.0.
- The blog post includes images showing the use of Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request with the XSS payload. It also shows the successful execution of the payload.
