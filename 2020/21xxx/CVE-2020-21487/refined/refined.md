Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper encoding of ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) output before sending it to the browser. Specifically, user-provided input, such as the `RootFolder` parameter in the `webroot local folder` method, is included in the output without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a potential XSS issue. Since the output is not encoded, a malicious user could inject HTML or JavaScript code via the `RootFolder` parameter or other similar input fields, leading to execution of malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in user's browser. This could potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    - Account compromise: Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the web interface of the pfSense ACME package.
- Specifically, a malicious user can exploit the `webroot local folder` method and input malicious code within the `RootFolder` parameter, which when processed is not properly encoded before outputting to the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to input data into the ACME package settings, typically through the pfSense web interface. This likely means the attacker would require some level of authentication on the firewall.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit log indicates that the vulnerability was fixed by adding proper text encoding to the output.
- The vulnerability was present in the ACME package of pfSense.
- The issue was resolved in version 0.6.3_1 of the ACME package.
- The fix involved changes to `acme_accountkeys.php` and `acme_certificates.php` files to prevent the output from being interpreted as HTML.
- The fix replaces the `html()` function with `text()` and applies `white-space: pre-wrap` to preserve formatting. It also replaces newlines with `<br />` tags in one of the instances.
