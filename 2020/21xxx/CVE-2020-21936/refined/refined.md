Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-21936:

**1. Login Bypass**

*   **Root Cause:** The router's login mechanism can be bypassed by sending specific requests, resulting in a partially authorized token and UID.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate authentication checks allow bypassing the login process.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain partial access to the router's functionality without proper credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `/HNAP1/` endpoint.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the router's web interface.

**2. /HNAP1/GetDownLoadSyslog Authentication Bypass**

*   **Root Cause:** The authentication mechanism for accessing the Syslog download functionality is not properly implemented.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication allows unauthenticated access to download system logs.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can download system logs without authentication.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an unauthenticated HTTP request to `/HNAP1/prog.fcgi?method=/HNAP1/GetDownLoadSyslog`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the router's web interface.

**3. Plain Text Password and Private Key Exposure**

*   **Root Cause:** The router logs sensitive information, including the admin password and private keys, in plain text within the syslog.
*   **Weakness:** Logging of sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Attackers who can access the system log can extract the admin password and private keys, gaining full control of the router.
*   **Attack Vector:** By downloading the syslog file, using the vulnerability described in point 2.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the router's web interface, access to the downloaded log file.

**4. Unauthenticated Access to Sensitive Information via HNAP1/GetMultipleHNAPs**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/HNAP1/GetMultipleHNAPs` endpoint allows unauthenticated access to certain methods that return sensitive information.
*   **Weakness:** Improper authentication and authorization controls for the `GetMultipleHNAPs` functionality.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can access sensitive router information, including connected devices, website filtering rules, and network settings, without authentication.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending an unauthenticated HTTP request to `/HNAP1/` with the `GetMultipleHNAPs` action.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the router's web interface.

**5. HNAP1/GetNetworkTomographySettings RCE**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability in the `HNAP1/GetNetworkTomographySettings` endpoint.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation when handling user-supplied data.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the router, potentially leading to complete compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a malicious payload through the `/HNAP1/GetNetworkTomographySettings` endpoint. Requires bypassing browser-side input validation, which can be achieved using browser extensions or proxy tools.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the router's web interface, ability to bypass client-side validation mechanisms.

**6. HNAP1/SetWLanApcliSettings RCE**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability in the `HNAP1/SetWLanApcliSettings` endpoint, particularly when the router is in repeater mode.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization when processing user-supplied parameters, specifically the password field when configuring the repeater.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the router, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the vulnerability through the router's web interface when configuring the repeater mode, injecting a malicious command in the password field.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the router, the router must be in repeater mode.

**Summary:**

The identified vulnerabilities within the Motorola CX2 router, relate to authentication bypass, information disclosure and remote code execution.  These issues stem from a lack of proper authentication and input validation, which could lead to complete compromise of the router.
