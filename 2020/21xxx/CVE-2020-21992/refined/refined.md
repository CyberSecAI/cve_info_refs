Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21992:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `web.cgi` binary of Inim Electronics SmartLiving SmartLAN devices. Specifically, the `testemail` module within this binary is vulnerable.
*   The `par` POST parameter, when used with the `testemail` module, is not properly sanitized.
*   The `web.cgi` binary (an ARM executable) uses the `system()` function to execute commands via the `mailx` service.
*   A format string vulnerability in how `mailx` is used allows for OS command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `par` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a `system()` call.
*   **Use of `system()`:** The use of `system()` with unsanitized input is a classic security risk.
*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The manner in which mailx is called allows for format string exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the vulnerable device with root privileges.
*   **Full System Access:**  Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control of the device.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** Default credentials can be used to bypass access restrictions.
*   **Potential DoS:** Although the primary impact is RCE, DoS is also listed as an impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over HTTP/HTTPS.
*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker sends a POST request to the `web.cgi` with the `mod=testemail` parameter.
*   **`par` Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious OS commands into the `par` parameter, which are executed when the `system()` function is called by the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device (SmartLAN).
*   **Authentication Credentials:** The attacker requires valid credentials for the web interface. The exploit code indicates that default credentials such as `user=admin;pass=pass;code=9999` can be used.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The `web.cgi` binary is an ELF 32-bit LSB executable for ARM architecture.
*   The vulnerable code calls `snprintf` to construct the command string, incorporating the attacker-controlled `par` parameter.
*   The assembled command string passed to `system()` looks something like this: `sh -c echo "Hello!" | mailx -s "Email test" <injected-command>`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered due to the `mailx` command usage which allows for format string injection.

**Affected Devices:**

*   SmartLiving 505
*   SmartLiving 515
*   SmartLiving 1050, SmartLiving 1050/G3
*   SmartLiving 10100L, SmartLiving10100L/G3
*   SmartLAN/SI and SmartLAN/G boards

**Important Note:**

The Ubuntu security notice explicitly states: "Does not apply to software found in Ubuntu." This indicates that while the CVE is registered, the vulnerability does not affect any software within Ubuntu's repositories, it's an issue with the embedded device firmware.

The provided exploit script, `smartlan_exploit.sh`, clearly demonstrates the exploitation process by sending a crafted POST request containing the malicious command within the `par` parameter.

This vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic of Zero Science Lab.
