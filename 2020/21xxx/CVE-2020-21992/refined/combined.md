# Inim Electronics SmartLiving SmartLAN/G/SI <=6.x Root Remote Command Execution
#
#
# Vendor: INIM Electronics s.r.l.
# Product web page: https://www.inim.biz
# Link: https://www.inim.biz/en/antintrusion-control-panels/home-automation/control-panel-smartliving?
# Affected version: <=6.x
# Affected models: SmartLiving 505
# SmartLiving 515
# SmartLiving 1050, SmartLiving 1050/G3
# SmartLiving 10100L, SmartLiving10100L/G3
#
# Summary: SmartLiving anti-intrusion control panel and security system provides
# important features rarely found in residential, commercial or industrial application
# systems of its kind. This optimized-performance control panel provides first-rate
# features such as: graphic display, text-to-speech, voice notifier, flexible hardware,
# end-to-end voice transmission (voice-on-bus), IP connectivity.
#
# SMARTLAN/SI:
# The system-on-chip platform used in the SmartLAN/SI accessory board provides point-to-point
# networking capability and fast connectivity to the Internet. Therefore, it is possible
# to set up a remote connection and program or control the system via the SmartLeague
# software application. In effect, the SmartLAN/SI board grants the same level of access
# to the system as a local RS232 connection.
#
# SMARTLAN/G:
# The SmartLAN/G board operates in the same way as the SmartLAN/SI but in addition provides
# advanced remote-access and communication functions. The SmartLAN/G board is capable of
# sending event-related e-mails automatically. Each e-mail can be associated with a subject,
# an attachment and a text message. The attachment can be of any kind and is saved to an
# SD card. The message text can contain direct links to domains or IP addressable devices,
# such as a security cameras. In addition to e-mails, the SmartLAN/G board offers users
# global access to their control panels via any Internet browser accessed through a PC,
# PDA or Smartphone. In fact, the SmartLAN/G has an integrated web-server capable of
# distinguishing the means of connection and as a result provides an appropriate web-page
# for the tool in use. Smartphones can control the system in much the same way as a
# household keypad, from inside the house or from any part of the world.
#
# Desc: SmartLiving SmartLAN suffers from an authenticated remote command injection vulnerability.
# The issue exist due to the 'par' POST parameter not being sanitized when called with
# the 'testemail' module through web.cgi binary. The vulnerable CGI binary (ELF 32-bit
# LSB executable, ARM) is calling the 'sh' executable via the system() function to issue
# a command using the mailx service and its vulnerable string format parameter allowing
# for OS command injection with root privileges. An attacker can remotely execute system
# commands as the root user using default credentials and bypass access controls in place.
