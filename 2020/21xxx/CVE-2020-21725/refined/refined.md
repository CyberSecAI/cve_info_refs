The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in OpenSNS v6.1.0, specifically a sleep-based blind SQL injection.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized user input in the `pid` parameter within the `Addons/ChinaCity/Controller/ChinaCityController.class.php` file, specifically around line 50. This parameter is used directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization of the `pid` parameter.
- Blind SQL injection: The injection is blind, meaning the attacker does not directly see the results of the query but can infer information based on the server's response time using the `sleep()` function.
- Unauthorised access: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: An attacker could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
- Denial of service: By injecting a long sleep time, an attacker could cause a denial of service.
- Complete compromise: An attacker may be able to compromise the entire system given the right database permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/index.php?s=%2Fhome%2Faddons%2F_addons%2Fchina_city%2F_controller%2Fchina_city%2F_action%2Fgetcity.html`.
- Manipulated 'pid' parameter: The vulnerable parameter is 'pid', which is an array. The malicious SQL query is inserted into the `pid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the server running OpenSNS.
- No authentication is required, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.

The provided information gives a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its location and how to exploit it, and provides more detailed information than is available in the standard CVE description.
