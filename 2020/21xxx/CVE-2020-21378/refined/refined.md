{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `admin_members_group.php` file where the `$id` variable is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. Although a `checksql` function exists for filtering SQL injection keywords, it can be bypassed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Bypassable SQL filtering mechanism"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information such as database usernames and database names.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request",
      "Manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable path (`/5owghc/admin_members_group.php`) and the ability to send crafted HTTP requests. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.",
      "additional_details": "The exploit leverages the `RLIKE` operator to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition via resource exhaustion. By repeatedly concatenating padded strings and matching them with regular expressions, the server is forced to perform computationally expensive operations, leading to delays. The exploit focuses on data exfiltration (database username/name) rather than a complete takeover."
