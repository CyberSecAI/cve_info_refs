Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21688:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a double-free or heap-use-after-free error within the FFmpeg library. This occurs specifically when remuxing RTP hint tracks, indicating an issue in how memory is handled during this process.
* The vulnerability is triggered in `libavutil/mem.c:231:5` within the `av_freep` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Double-free:** The code attempts to free a memory region that has already been freed, which leads to a crash or potentially exploitable memory corruption.
*   **Heap-use-after-free:** The code accesses memory that has already been released, which is also a critical memory corruption issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) due to program crashes.
*   Potentially, the heap corruption could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly stated. The provided description states, "several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FFmpeg multimedia framework, which could result in denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if malformed files/streams are processed."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing specially crafted or malformed media files or streams, specifically those that include RTP hint tracks.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when remuxing such files. The provided reproducer shows a command to trigger it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed media file or stream to a vulnerable FFmpeg instance, specifically when remuxing an RTP hint track.
*   The attacker does not need a privileged position on the machine; they only require access to the vulnerable instance and the ability to pass it an affected media file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue was reported using AddressSanitizer (ASAN), which is a memory error detector, highlighting that memory corruption is at play.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the git commit `22c3cd176079dd104ec7610ead697235b04396f1`.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4998-1) includes this CVE, meaning that Debian users were impacted and should update the package.

**Summary of extracted information:**
The vulnerability is a double-free or heap-use-after-free when remuxing RTP hint tracks. This memory corruption leads to a denial-of-service and potentially arbitrary code execution. The attack vector is providing a malformed file with RTP hint tracks to be remuxed.
