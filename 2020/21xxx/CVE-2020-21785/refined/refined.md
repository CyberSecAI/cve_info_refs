Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is insufficient sanitization of the filename parameter used in the database backup functionality. The application constructs a command string using the user-provided filename, which leads to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the filename parameter, before using it in a system command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the command string executed by the system.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The input validation performed on the filename is inadequate, and fails to block characters that are essential for command injection. The provided description mentions filtering of file types and some sensitive characters, but it is not effective enough to prevent the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the command injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. The provided example shows execution of the `ipconfig` command.
*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain full control over the server hosting the application, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of the IBOS application's database backup function.
*   **Filename Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious filename containing special characters that can be interpreted as shell commands.
*   **Direct Command Execution:** By injecting commands through the filename, the attacker can bypass the application's logic and directly execute system commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the database backup functionality within the IBOS application's administration interface.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge about the command injection vulnerability to craft a payload that can successfully execute commands.
*   **Access to the Web Application:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to interact with the database backup function.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `IBOS\system\core\utils\Database.php`.
*   The command is executed using the following structure:
    ```
    `{$mysqlBin}mysqldump --force --quick {$command1} --add-drop-table {$command2} {$command3} --host="{$db['host']}" {$command5} --user="{$db['username']}" --password="{$db['password']}" "{$db['dbname']}" {$tablesstr} > {$dumpFile}`;
    ```
*   The `$dumpFile` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.
*   The provided payload `2020-01-17\_exdEQ1ro&ipconfig>kkkkkk&ss` demonstrates successful command execution.
*   The `ipconfig` command output was redirected to the file `kkkkkk`, which was later accessed via a browser.
*   The vulnerability was found in IBOS version 4.5.4 OPEN.

**Solution:**

*   The recommended solution is to implement more thorough input validation and sanitization on the filename parameter. This involves filtering out special characters that can be used for command injection before passing the filename to the system command.
