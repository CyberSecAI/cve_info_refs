The content is related to CVE-2020-21359.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file upload functionality within the "超级控制台->模板->模板管理" section of the maccms10 system. Specifically, the application's file extension whitelist validation can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate file extension validation: The system uses a whitelist to allow specific file extensions during uploads. However, this validation can be bypassed by appending a dot (`.`) to the end of the filename, such as `1.php.`. This bypass allows arbitrary file uploads despite the extension checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution (RCE): By uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g., a webshell) with a bypassed extension, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows full control over the server and potentially access sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload functionality within the maccms10 administration interface.
- Bypassing file extension whitelist validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the administrative backend of maccms10 ("超级控制台->模板->模板管理").
- Ability to upload files.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability and how to exploit it (adding a dot to the end of the file name).
