Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-21994:

**Root Cause:**

*   The AVE DOMINAplus system stores administrative login credentials in cleartext within an XML file (`/xml/authClients.xml`). This file is located in an unprotected directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The system fails to properly protect user credentials, storing them in plain text within an XML file.
*   **Inadequate Access Controls:** The directory containing the sensitive XML file is not protected, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The exposure of credentials allows an attacker to bypass the system's authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Access:** Successful exploitation grants unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Security Bypass:** The vulnerability enables attackers to bypass authentication controls.
*   **DoS (Denial of Service):** The advisory mentions DoS as a potential impact, although the specific attack vector for this isn't detailed in the provided text. The access gained could facilitate DoS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker directly requests the vulnerable XML file (`/xml/authClients.xml`) via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected AVE DOMINAplus device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any existing credentials or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of AVE DOMINAplus products, including various Web Server, Touch Screen, and App versions.
*   The default credentials were noted as "admin:password".
*   The configuration and camera credentials were also noted as vulnerable at `/xml/tsconf.xml`
*   A Python proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available.
