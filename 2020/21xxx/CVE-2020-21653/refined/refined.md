Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `sj()` method in `/application/admin/controller/index.php` of Myucms v2.2. This method takes a `title` parameter from a POST request and uses it to fetch data, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. The application allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL in the `title` parameter, which the server then attempts to fetch. This can be used to:
    *   Read local files using the `file://` protocol.
    *   Access internal network resources that are not directly reachable from the internet.
    *   Make requests to external websites.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the input in the `title` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By using the `file://` protocol, an attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files containing database credentials.
*   **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker can use the server as a proxy to scan the internal network for open ports and vulnerable services.
*   **External Site Interactions:** The attacker can make the server make requests to arbitrary external sites, potentially leading to further attacks or information exposure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/admin.php/index/sj` with the `title` parameter set to a malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to the application:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which is likely behind an authentication wall. However, the content doesn't explicitly state if the user needs to be authenticated, only that they must "login."
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must know about the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin.php/index/sj`) and how to exploit it by manipulating the `title` parameter.
