The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the Motorola CX2 router, and CVE-2020-21935 is mentioned as one of them, alongside several other CVEs. Based on the provided information, CVE-2020-21935 is associated with a command injection vulnerability through `HNAP1/SetWLanApcliSettings`, although the specific steps to exploit this particular vulnerability are detailed alongside others.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2020-21935, specifically:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `HNAP1/SetWLanApcliSettings` function when the router is in repeater mode.

**Vulnerability:**
- Command injection vulnerability.

**Impact:**
- Arbitrary system command execution on the router with root privileges.
- Complete compromise of the device.

**Attack Vector:**
- Web interface of the router via the HNAP1 API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have access to its web interface.
- The router must be set to repeater mode.
- The attacker needs to modify network parameters via the web interface.
- The attacker needs to bypass input validation which can be achieved via browser developer tools or using a proxy.

**Detailed steps for exploitation are as follows:**
1. Set the router to repeater mode.
2. Initiate the "extend wireless network" function.
3. Input a malicious payload within the password field for the extended network.
4. Submit the form.
5. The router might throw an error on the first attempt, but the attack should be successful after submitting the form again.
6. The injected command will be executed, leading to arbitrary code execution. The specific example provided is `iwpriv apclix0 set ApCliWPAPSK=&& ping www.baidu.com`, but any command can be injected.
