Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-21606

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `put_epel_16_fallback` function when decoding a specially crafted HEVC (H.265) video file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `put_epel_16_fallback` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash caused by the heap buffer overflow can lead to a denial of service, making the application unavailable.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While the provided information doesn't confirm arbitrary code execution, heap buffer overflows are a known vector for such attacks, meaning it is a potential outcome if exploited further.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HEVC file:** A specially crafted HEVC video file is required to trigger the vulnerability. This file could be delivered through various means, such as:
    *   Directly to a user for local processing
    *   Via a web service that processes user provided video files
    *   Embedded in a webpage that would automatically process a malicious file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** An attacker must be able to provide the specially crafted HEVC file to a vulnerable application or service that uses the libde265 library.
*   **No special privileges:**  The vulnerability is triggered during normal processing of the video file, and does not appear to require special user or system privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in `fallback-motion.cc` at line 289.
*   The ASAN output provides details on the location of the heap overflow and the call stack, which is helpful for debugging.
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) file is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The issue was discovered through fuzzing.
*   The vulnerability affects the `libde265` library, an implementation of the H.265 video codec.
*   Debian has released a security update (DSA-5346-1) to address this vulnerability, along with others.

**Summary:**

This CVE describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `put_epel_16_fallback` function of the `libde265` library. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a malicious HEVC file, leading to a denial of service and potentially enabling arbitrary code execution. The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description and includes a crash log, source file details, and a POC file.
