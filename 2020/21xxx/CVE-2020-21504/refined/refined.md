Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified XSS vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the Waimai Super Cms application. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens to impersonate users.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information from the user's browser.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.
    - **Phishing attacks:** Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited through the following HTTP parameters and headers:
    - `Referer` header: used in `/admin.php?m=Config&a=add` and `/admin.php/Link/addsave` requests
    - `page` parameter: used in requests to the root `/` path using the `delURL=1` and `url=x` query parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with malicious payloads in the `Referer` header or `page` parameter.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability in the `/?delURL=1&url=x&page=` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin pages to exploit the `Referer` header vulnerability.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations:**
- `/admin.php?m=Config&a=add`
- `/admin.php/Link/addsave`
- `/?delURL=1&url=x&page=`

**Payload Examples:**
- `Referer: '"><script>alert(123)</script>`
- `Referer: '"><script>alert(456)</script>`
- `POST /?delURL=1&url=x&page=%22;alert(xssone);%20var%20d=%22 HTTP/1.1`

**Additional Notes**

- The provided content includes screenshots demonstrating successful XSS attacks.
- The issue report indicates that these vulnerabilities were found in the "master" branch of the Waimai Super Cms project.
- The vulnerability in `/?delURL=1&url=x&page=` does not require the user to be logged in.
