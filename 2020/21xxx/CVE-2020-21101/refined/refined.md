Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the 'Add Asset' page of Screenly-OSE. The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided in the "Asset URL" field when adding new assets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious JavaScript is stored in the system's database/storage and executed when a user views the asset later.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application doesn't sanitize the 'Asset URL' field, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary Javascript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the victim views the asset. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Defacing the application's UI
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is the 'Add Asset' functionality within Screenly-OSE.
*   The attacker inputs a malicious payload (JavaScript code) within the "Asset URL" field.
*   When another user views the main 'Schedule Overview' page or other sections where this asset is loaded, the stored malicious script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to add assets within the Screenly-OSE application. This likely requires a user account with appropriate permissions.
*   The attacker does not require any special network position or ability to intercept traffic. The attack is purely client-side, leveraging the stored malicious content.

**Additional Details:**
*   The content provided is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including the specific steps for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is also present when uploading a file as an asset in addition to just a URL.
*   The vulnerable API endpoint is `/api/v1.2/assets`.
*   A proof of concept is provided showing how to inject JavaScript using the `<img>` tag's `onerror` attribute.
