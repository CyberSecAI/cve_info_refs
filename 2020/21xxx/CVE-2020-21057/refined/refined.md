Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is due to an unsanitized "folder" variable in the `app\edit\folderdelete.php` file of FusionPBX versions up to 4.5.7. This variable is taken directly from the URL, allowing an attacker to manipulate it and specify any folder path on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where the lack of sanitization on the "folder" variable enables an attacker to access and delete arbitrary directories within the server's filesystem.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is the failure to properly validate or sanitize the "folder" parameter received from the URL before using it in the `rmdir()` function, which is used to delete the folder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Folder Deletion:** An authenticated attacker could delete any folder on the server's filesystem that the web server process has write access to.
*   **Potential Data Loss/System Instability:** Deleting critical system folders could lead to data loss, system instability, or complete system failure.
*   **Denial of Service:** By deleting specific folders, an attacker could disrupt the normal functioning of the FusionPBX application, leading to a denial-of-service situation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP URL Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with a "folder" parameter pointing to the target directory for deletion. The attacker sends a request to the `/app/edit/folderdelete.php` script with the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the FusionPBX system. This means they would need to have a valid login for the FusionPBX web interface.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable URL:** The attacker would need knowledge of the vulnerable file path `app\edit\folderdelete.php` and how the `folder` parameter works.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub commit diff shows that the fix involved renaming `folderdelete.php` to `folder_delete.php` and commenting out the functionality. In this particular commit, the functionality is disabled, likely as a temporary measure until a more robust fix could be implemented.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Pierre Jourdan and fixed by Mark J Crane on the same day (13/08/2019) indicating a quick response to the report.
