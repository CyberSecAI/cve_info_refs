Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control enforcement in the MyDomoAtHome (MDAH) REST API. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive data due to inadequate access controls.
- Lack of Authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication, meaning anyone can potentially access the sensitive data.
- Missing authorization checks: The API does not enforce proper authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated requests to access sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of System Information: Attackers can gain access to internal system details.
- Exposure of Sensitive Information: This includes potentially sensitive data such as camera URLs with embedded credentials, device configurations and other potentially sensitive information.
- Security Bypass: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security measures designed to protect the sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Specially Crafted Requests: Attackers send specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoint. In particular, the `/devices` endpoint is vulnerable to information disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
- No Authentication Needed: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of API endpoint: Attacker must have knowledge of vulnerable endpoint `/devices`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable software is MyDomoAtHome (MDAH) REST API Domoticz ISS Gateway version 0.2.40.
*   The vulnerability was tested on various NodeJS versions (10.15.0, 8.15.1, 8.15.0, 8.11.1, 8.9.4, 4.8.7, 4.2.2) with EJS as the Webmanager/Engine and Express as the Renderer.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) involves sending a GET request to the `/devices` endpoint, which reveals sensitive device parameters like `localjpegurl`, `localmjpegurl`, `remotejpegurl`, and `remotemjpegurl`, which contain camera URLs with embedded credentials.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko Krstic ('LiquidWorm') from Zero Science Lab.
