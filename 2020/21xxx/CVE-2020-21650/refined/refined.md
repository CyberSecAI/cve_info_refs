The provided content describes a vulnerability in Myucms v2.2, specifically within the `config.php`'s `add()` method. This aligns with CVE-2020-21650, which involves arbitrary command execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `add()` method in `WWW\application\admin\controller\Config.php` directly incorporates user-provided input from the `accesskey` parameter into a PHP configuration file without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically the input is written as a string into `application/extra/web.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The vulnerability stems from the direct injection of unvalidated user input into a PHP file, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `accesskey` parameter is not sanitized before being written to the `web.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control of the web server by injecting malicious PHP code, allowing them to execute commands, modify files, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored on the server including database credentials.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can deface the website by altering its content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request to the `admin.php/config/add` endpoint. The attacker needs to provide the malicious PHP code within the `accesskey` parameter of the URL, such as `accesskey=%27,phpinfo(),%27`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user to access the `/admin.php/config/add` URL
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
