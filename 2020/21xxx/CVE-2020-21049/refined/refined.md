{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing allocation size limit, which could lead to a large memory allocation when processing a crafted image.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "A large memory allocation could lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption, or potentially a crash if memory allocation fails.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted image file, specifically a PSD file, which causes an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient bounds checking.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted image file to the application."
  },
  "additional_details": "The commit `0b1e0b3` introduces a `SIXEL_ALLOCATE_BYTES_MAX` macro to limit the allocation size to 128MB, addressing the missing limit. The issue #74 also includes an Address Sanitizer output showing the crash in `stbi__psd_decode_rle` function, further indicating a memory safety issue.",
