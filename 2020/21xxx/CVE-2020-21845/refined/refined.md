Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Content Relevance:**

The content from `vyshnavvizz.blogspot.com` directly relates to a vulnerability in Codoforum, specifically version 4.8.3, which is within the scope of the unspecified CVE (CVE-2020-21845).

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Manage Users" section of the admin dashboard. Specifically, HTML tags are not filtered when creating a new user.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the presence of **HTML Injection**. User-supplied input is directly rendered without proper encoding, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By injecting HTML, an attacker can potentially:
    *   Modify the appearance of the admin dashboard, potentially misleading administrators.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites using `<a>` tags.
    *   Potentially execute malicious scripts using `<script>` tags, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks (though this isn't explicitly stated in the provided text, it's a strong possibility given HTML injection).
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive information through forms or other techniques that require active user interaction.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Manage Users" section of the Codoforum admin panel. Specifically, by injecting HTML into input fields such as "username" or "password" during the creation of new users.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs administrative access to the Codoforum instance to access the admin dashboard.
    *   The attacker must be able to navigate to the "Manage Users" section.
    *   The attacker must be able to input HTML code into the user creation fields.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided blog post explicitly states that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable, implying that the vulnerability is accessible over a network.
*   The blog post provides a basic Proof of Concept (POC) by injecting `<h1>Vyshnav</h1>` and showing that the HTML is executed.
*   The blog post mentions the affected product is CodoForum version 4.8.3.
