Say good bye to the old, cluttered and cumbersome
forum interfaces. Our Forum software has a fresh UI which is
simple, clean and impressive with a fast and secure engine
underneath.

## Mobile Ready

No more separate apps or websites for mobile
devices. Codoforum provides a free layout structure that is fully
responsive, which can not only spread throughout large screens but
also squeeze into tiny devices.

## Rich Content

Our WYSIWYG shows live preview as you type. It
recognizes Markdown as well as BBCode if you are coming from another
forum script. Images and other rich content can be easily embedded,
files can be attached and code blocks are prettified.

login system and it provides name and avatar synchronization too.
Now you don't need a separate login for your website and your forum
software.
It also supports the most popular social logins,
reducing the time-to-post and increasing the likelihood of engaging
a visitor.
