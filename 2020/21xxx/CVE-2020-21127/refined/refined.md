Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `logs/index.class.php` file of Metinfo CMS. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Specifically, it's a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application does not directly output the results of the injected SQL query, making it necessary to use techniques like time-based injection (e.g., `sleep()`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This can lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive data).
    *   Data modification (altering database records).
    *   Potential full database compromise.
    *   Privilege escalation (if the database user has higher permissions)
*   **System takeover:** Depending on the database privileges, it could allow for potential access to the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/?n=logs&c=index&a=dodel` endpoint.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel of the Metinfo CMS. The provided payload includes cookies which suggests the need to authenticate.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** An understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques is required to craft a proper payload.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Metinfo CMS instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `logs/index.class.php` file between lines 32 and 45.
*   The provided payload demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using the `sleep()` function to verify the injection.
