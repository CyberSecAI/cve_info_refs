Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability present in the NukeViet CMS module, specifically within the "shops" module. This vulnerability is found in two separate locations:
  - `index.php?language=vi&nv=shops&op=detail`
  - `index.php?language=vi&nv=shops&op=search_result`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- The `search_result.php` vulnerability is noted to have the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of the vulnerability is rated as "CRITICAL".
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, extract sensitive information, or even achieve remote code execution.
- The `search_result.php` vulnerability is specifically called out to have RCE capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints by manipulating parameters in the URL.
  -  `http://nukeviethost/index.php?language=vi&nv=shops&op=detail`
  - `http://nukeviethost/index.php?language=vi&nv=shops&op=search_result`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely without any prior access.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes references to specific proof-of-concept (POC) files: `POC-15171` and `POC-15181`. It also refers to disclosure documents (`Bug_Disclosure_Full.pdf` and `Bug_Disclosure_Search.pdf`) which likely contain further technical details.
- Patches were released to address the vulnerabilities
- A security advisory on `nukeviet.vn` confirms the existence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in NukeViet 4 and the shops module.
- The advisory highlights that the `shops` module vulnerability is particularly dangerous.
- Specific files that were modified by the patch are
  - `modules/shops/funcs/detail.php`
  - `modules/shops/funcs/search_result.php`
- The vulnerability is server-side
