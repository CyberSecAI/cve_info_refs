Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-21999

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authenticated OS command injection flaw in the `pingTest.php` script of the FaceSentry Access Control System. The script takes user input from the `strInIP` POST parameter and passes it directly to the `exec()` function within a `sudo ping` command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands by manipulating the `strInIP` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The core issue is that user-controlled data is directly used in a system command without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Authentication Bypass via Default Credentials:** The exploit utilizes default credentials to authenticate to the web interface before exploiting the command injection. This is not part of the vulnerability itself but needed to exploit it.
- **Use of `sudo` without proper input validation:** The `ping` command is executed with `sudo`, meaning any injected command will also run with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Root Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges. This effectively allows an attacker to fully compromise the device.
- **Access Control Bypass:** While not directly stated in the CVE, the exploit code also has functionality to unlock doors. This can be an impact for system where the device manages access.
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker with root access can gain access to sensitive data stored on the device.
- **System Manipulation:** An attacker could modify device settings, install malware, and disable the device, causing a disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `pingTest.php` script.
- **`strInIP` Parameter:** The attacker injects commands within the `strInIP` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the FaceSentry device's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker requires valid login credentials. The vulnerability can be exploited using the default credentials provided with the device. This is what is used in the exploit code.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `pingTest.php` script and the `strInIP` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit is effective against the following firmware versions:
    - 6.4.8 build 264 (Algorithm A16)
    - 5.7.2 build 568 (Algorithm A14)
    - 5.7.0 build 539 (Algorithm A14)
- The exploit was tested on various Linux distributions and PHP versions running on ARM architectures.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic of Zero Science Lab.
- The vendor was unresponsive.
