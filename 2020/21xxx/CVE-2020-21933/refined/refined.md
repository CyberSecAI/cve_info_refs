The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Motorola CX2 router, including CVE-2020-21933.

**CVE-2020-21933:** This entry is specifically related to the unauthenticated access to sensitive information through the `HNAP1/GetMultipleHNAPs` method.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `HNAP1/GetMultipleHNAPs` endpoint does not enforce authentication, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The `HNAP1/GetMultipleHNAPs` endpoint lacks proper authentication, allowing anyone to access it.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `GetStationSettings`, `GetWebsiteFilterSettings`, and `GetNetworkSettings` methods return sensitive data such as connected device MAC addresses, website filter rules and network configurations that should not be accessible without authentication. Specifically, `parent_control_rule` contains website filter rules.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can obtain sensitive information about the router's configuration and connected devices without any authentication. This information can be used for further malicious activities, such as reconnaissance, targeted attacks, or social engineering.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `HNAP1/GetMultipleHNAPs` endpoint, without prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or be able to send HTTP requests to the router. No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific API calls involved and the sensitive information that can be leaked. The provided `curl` command can be used to reproduce the vulnerability.
