The provided content describes an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in NewsOne CMS version 1.1.0. This vulnerability is not related to CVE-2020-21976, which is a placeholder.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation or sanitization. Specifically, the "user\_image" field on the `/auth/edit` page is vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The system does not restrict the file type or content uploaded via the "user\_image" field, allowing the upload of malicious files.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application lacks proper validation of uploaded files, allowing attackers to bypass security measures.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, such as PHP scripts, leading to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP script, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially compromising the entire system.
    *   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could overwrite existing files or upload new ones to deface the website.
    *   **Data Theft or Manipulation:**  The attacker could use the compromised server to access or modify sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/auth/edit` endpoint with a malicious file uploaded as "user\_image".
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a regular user. The demo credentials provided in the content (member/member12345) could be used to gain access to the vulnerable functionality.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable web application.
