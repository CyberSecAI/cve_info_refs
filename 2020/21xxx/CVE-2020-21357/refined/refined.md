The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in PopojiCMS version 1.2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when creating or editing user accounts, specifically the email field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the email field when adding a new user. This payload is then stored in the database.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When the user information is viewed, the stored JavaScript code is executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Cookie theft
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email field when adding or editing a user via the "Tambah Pengguna" (Add User) functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the privilege to add or edit users within the PopojiCMS application.
