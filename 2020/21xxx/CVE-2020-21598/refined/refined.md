Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21598:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `ff_hevc_put_unweighted_pred_8_sse` function. This function is related to motion compensation during HEVC video decoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a heap-buffer-overflow, meaning the code writes past the allocated boundary of a buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact, as stated in the Debian LTS advisory, is a denial of service. This is supported by the ASan output that shows the program aborting.
*   **Potentially arbitrary code execution:** The Debian security advisory notes that multiple issues in `libde265`, including this one, "may result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed media file is processed." While the provided information does not confirm code execution, it does highlight the possibility.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted video file:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted HEVC video file. This means the attacker would need to provide a malformed video file to the vulnerable decoder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted video file to a system that uses the vulnerable version of `libde265`. This could be through various means, like:
    *   A website that processes user-uploaded video files
    *   A media player application
    *   Any service that decodes HEVC video using libde265

**Additional Details:**

*   The ASan output provides a call stack leading to the vulnerability, starting from `main` in `dec265.cc`, showing that `dec265` was used to trigger this issue.
*   The issue is present in `x86/sse-motion.cc` at line 149.
*   The provided POC file can be used to trigger this vulnerability.
