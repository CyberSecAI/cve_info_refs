Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21532:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow within the `setfigfont()` function in fig2dev.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Global buffer overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs in a globally allocated buffer, specifically within the `setfigfont()` function. This type of overflow can lead to corruption of other global data or control flow hijacking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The provided information indicates a potential for "denial-of-service or other unspecified impact". This suggests the overflow could lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the context.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted XFig file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted XFig figure file that will be processed by fig2dev. This could be done through various means, such as tricking a user into opening a malicious file or processing a malicious file via an automated system.
