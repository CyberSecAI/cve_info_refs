  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'xyhai.php?s=/Link/index' page, the attacker can have that code executed when other users visit that page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious code into the system, likely through some form of input field that is later displayed on the vulnerable page. No other specific position is mentioned beyond being able to inject the malicious code."
