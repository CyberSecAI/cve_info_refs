Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21913:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability discovered in the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service, making the affected system or service unavailable.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** There is a possibility that this vulnerability could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to run malicious code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The provided information does not specify the exact attack vector, but it can be inferred that it involves triggering the use-after-free condition within the ICU library, likely through specially crafted input or manipulation of data that ICU processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that causes the vulnerable code path in ICU to be executed. This could involve:
    - Network access (if the affected system is a server)
    - Ability to interact with the affected software that relies on the ICU library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved using `LocalMemory` for `cmd` to prevent use-after-free, as detailed in the commit message: `ICU-20850 Use LocalMemory for cmd to prevent use after free`. This suggests the `cmd` variable was previously allocated in a way that made it susceptible to being freed prematurely.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of ICU, including those used in Debian 9 (Stretch) and Debian 10 (Buster) and likely other systems using the library.
*   The security advisories indicate that the issue has been addressed by updating the `icu` packages.
