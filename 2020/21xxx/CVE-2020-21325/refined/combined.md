## Description

![@DengyigeFeng](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29322812?v=4&size=48)[DengyigeFeng](https://github.com/DengyigeFeng)opened [on Nov 18, 2019](https://github.com/wuzhicms/wuzhicms/issues/188#issue-524216791)

1.In the set\_cache method of the \coreframe\app\core\libs\function\common.func.php file, when $data is not of the array type, $data will be written directly to the php file.

```
function set_cache($filename, $data, $dir = '_cache_'){
	static $_dirs;
	if ($dir == '') return FALSE;
	if (!preg_match('/([a-z0-9_]+)/i', $filename)) return FALSE;
	$cache_path = CACHE_ROOT . $dir . '/';
	if (!isset($_dirs[$filename . $dir])) {
		if (!is_dir($cache_path)) {
			mkdir($cache_path, 0777, true);
		}
		$_dirs[$filename . $dir] = 1;
	}

	$filename = $cache_path . $filename . '.' . CACHE_EXT . '.php';
	if (is_array($data)) {
		$data = '<?php' . "\r\n return " . array2string($data) . '?>';
	}
	file_put_contents($filename, $data);
}

```

The set\_cache method is called in the set method of the \coreframe\app\attachment\admin\index.php file, and $GLOBALS['setting'] has not been filtered，so anything can be written to the php file.

```
    public function set()
    {
        if (isset($GLOBALS['submit'])) {
            set_cache(M, $GLOBALS['setting']);
            MSG(L('operation_success'), HTTP_REFERER, 3000);
        } else {
            $show_dialog = 1;
            load_class('form');
            $setting = &$this->_cache;
            if(!isset($setting['show_mode'])) {
				$setting = array('show_mode'=>2,'watermark_enable'=>1,'watermark_pos'=>0,'watermark_text'=>'www.wuzhicms.com');
				set_cache(M, $setting);
			}
            include $this->template('set', M);
        }
    }

```

Finally, on line 21 of \coreframe\app\attachment\admin\index.php, a php file that can write arbitrary content will be loaded.

 `$this->_cache = get_cache(M);`
