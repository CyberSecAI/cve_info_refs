{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `set_cache` function in `common.func.php` directly writes data to a PHP file without proper sanitization when the data is not an array. This function is called by the `set` method in `index.php`, which passes unsanitized user-controlled data (`$GLOBALS['setting']`) to `set_cache`. Subsequently, the generated cache file is included in `index.php`, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unsanitized user input passed to `set_cache`",
    "Direct writing of unsanitized data to PHP file via `file_put_contents`",
    "Inclusion of arbitrary PHP file"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows an attacker to potentially gain full control over the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP request via the `attachment/admin/index.php?m=attachment&f=index&v=set` endpoint"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to log in to the administration panel of the WUZHI CMS."
