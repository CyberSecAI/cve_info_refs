- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in Metinfo7.0.0beta CMS. The email parameter is not properly sanitized when passed to the `get_user_by_email` function, which eventually leads to an unsanitized input in the SQL query in `get_user_by_emailid`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the SQL injection flaw due to inadequate sanitization of user-provided input.
    - Information Disclosure: The encryption key is disclosed in `/config/config_safe.php`, which allows attackers to create malicious payloads.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  An attacker can potentially manipulate the database, allowing unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.
    - In this instance, the attacker can bypass the authentication process via SQL injection in the password recovery mechanism.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is via a crafted email parameter in the password recovery process of the Metinfo CMS. 
    - The attacker needs to first obtain the encryption key from `config/config_safe.php`
    - The attacker then needs to encrypt the malicious SQL payload with the key via the `authcode` function, mimicking valid encrypted email values.
    - The encrypted payload needs to be sent to `/metinfo/7.0beta/member/getpassword.php` via a POST request.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have network access to the Metinfo CMS application.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application.
    - The attacker needs to be able to get the key via `/config/config_safe.php`, which may require knowledge of the system's file structure, or could be achievable by directory traversal (not specified).
