Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-21529:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Stack buffer overflow** in the `bezier_spline()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists specifically in the `bezier_spline()` function. This occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-Service:** The advisory mentions that buffer overflows can lead to a denial-of-service.
*   **Unspecified impact**: The advisory also indicates the potential for other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the processing of a malformed XFig figure file by `fig2dev`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted XFig file to `fig2dev`.
