- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CMS (Feehicms-2.0.8) only performs client-side (JavaScript) validation of the uploaded file's extension, which can be easily bypassed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient server-side validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script (e.g., a web shell) and gain remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system. The attacker can then execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker intercepts the file upload request using a tool like Burp Suite, modifies the request to upload a PHP file, and submits the modified request to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to access the avatar upload functionality in the CMS. They need to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request (e.g., using a proxy tool like Burp Suite). They also need to have knowledge of web application security and how to bypass client-side validation.
