The provided content relates to CVE-2020-21819.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `htmlescape` function within the `escape.c` file of the libredwg project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory through a pointer that has a NULL value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a crash due to a segmentation fault (SEGV), leading to a denial of service. The program terminates abruptly when the NULL pointer is dereferenced, preventing it from completing its intended operation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted DWG file (the PoC) that, when processed by the `dwg2SVG` tool, triggers the NULL pointer dereference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted DWG file to the `dwg2SVG` tool for processing. This could involve getting a victim to open the file, or by using it as part of a larger attack chain where the file is processed by a vulnerable server.
