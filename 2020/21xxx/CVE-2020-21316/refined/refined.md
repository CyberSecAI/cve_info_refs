The provided content relates to CVE-2020-21316.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the comment section of the application, specifically within the `username` parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores unsanitized user input (`username` parameter) in the database. When the comment is displayed, the stored script is executed within the context of the user's browser.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary web script execution: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- Administrator cookie theft: By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can steal administrator cookies and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP POST request to the `/post/addComment` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `username` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a comment with a crafted `username` parameter to an affected blog post.
