- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing comments, leading to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers. This can be used to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect users to malicious websites. In this case, it can capture other users' cookies.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to inject the malicious payload through the comment editing feature in the product overview, specifically by manipulating the "lastComment" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the application and able to edit comments. They must also be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, which can be achieved through tools like Burp Suite. The provided exploit requires manipulation of the `lastComment` parameter when editing a comment.
