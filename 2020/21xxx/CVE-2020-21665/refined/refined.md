Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes made in the commit, focusing on potential security implications:

**1. application/admin/controller/Ajax.php:**

*   **Vulnerability:** The commit includes a fix related to "修复排序表名安全检测" (fix sorting table name security detection). This indicates a potential vulnerability where the `table` parameter in the `weigh` function, which is used to construct database queries, was not properly validated. This could have allowed for SQL injection or other database manipulation attacks.
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper sanitization/validation of the `table` parameter passed through the POST request.
*   **Weakness:**  SQL Injection vulnerability due to the lack of input validation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted POST request to the `/admin/ajax/weigh` endpoint, with the `table` parameter set to a SQL injection payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to send POST requests to the application's `/admin/ajax/weigh` endpoint and must have the ability to inject malicious SQL queries into the table parameter.

**2. application/common/controller/Backend.php**

*   **Vulnerability:** The commit includes a fix related to "修复Selectpage编辑时分页大小错误" (fix the page size error when editing Selectpage). While not directly a security vulnerability, it is a bug fix related to the `selectpage` function.
*   **Root Cause:** Error in the logic of the `selectpage` function which was causing issues with pagination.
*  **Weakness:** Bug that causes incorrect pagination during a select page edit.
*   **Impact:** Not directly exploitable, impacts user experience.

**3. application/index/controller/User.php**

*   **Vulnerability:** The commit fixes a typo/logical error in the email verification process, changing `$mobile` to `$email`  in the line `$captchaResult = Ems::check($mobile, $captcha, 'register');`.
*   **Root Cause:** Error in the logic of the registration process where the email verification was checking the mobile variable instead of email variable.
*  **Weakness:** Logical error leading to misconfiguration of the email verification process.
*   **Impact:** Not directly exploitable, potential impact on functionality of the registration process.

**Summary:**

The primary security fix in this commit is the sanitization of the `table` parameter in the `Ajax.php` controller, which addresses a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Other fixes are primarily bug fixes related to pagination and email verification.

**Relation to CVE-2020-21665:**

Without the CVE description, it is difficult to say definitively if this commit directly addresses the reported vulnerability. However, given the "修复排序表名安全检测" fix within the commit, it is plausible that this commit is related to CVE-2020-21665, as the official CVE description likely references a SQL injection vulnerability stemming from unsanitized input. If the official description details a lack of input validation in the `weigh` function, or specifically relates to the `table` parameter, this commit likely represents a fix for that vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message "修复邮箱验证码错误" (fix email verification code error) aligns with the changes in `User.php`.
*   The commit provides a level of detail for the vulnerabilities being addressed.

**Response:**
