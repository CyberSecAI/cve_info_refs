The provided content describes a vulnerability in IBOS 4.5.4 OPEN, specifically an arbitrary file inclusion vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file extensions within the `CronController.php` when handling scheduled tasks. While the system verifies the save path and file name, it doesn't ensure the file has a specific extension, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files that may contain malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include a file with arbitrary content in the execution flow of the application.
*   **Insecure File Upload:** A separate command injection vulnerability (referenced as `https://gitee.com/ibos/IBOS/issues/I18IIV`) is used to create a file with the required content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a file with malicious PHP code and then executing it as part of a scheduled task, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. The provided example shows `phpinfo()` and `ipconfig` command execution.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could grant the attacker complete control of the server, leading to data theft, system manipulation, or further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Command Injection:** The attacker first exploits a command injection vulnerability to write a malicious PHP file to a directory accessible by the application, e.g., `/system/modules/recruit/cron`.
    The provided example uses the following payload to write a file named "zzzzzz" containing PHP code that executes a GET parameter named "test":
    `%26cd%20system%26cd%20modules%26cd%20recruit%26cd%20cron%26echo+eval($_GET["test"]);>>zzzzz%26aaa`
2.  **Scheduled Task Modification:** The attacker navigates to the scheduled task management interface and modifies an existing or creates a new scheduled task. They set the task script to include the previously uploaded file (e.g., "zzzzzz").
3.  **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker then triggers the scheduled task either via the UI, or waits for the scheduled time. The PHP code contained in the included file will be executed with the user's HTTP request. By adding the `test` parameter with commands, attacker can execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged into the IBOS system and have access to the management background to exploit the command injection vulnerability and modify scheduled tasks.
*   **Knowledge of Command Injection Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the command injection vulnerability used in the first step.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target IBOS server.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue was reported in January 2020, and the issue state is marked as "已完成" (Completed) in the report.
*   The vulnerability affects IBOS version 4.5.4 OPEN.
