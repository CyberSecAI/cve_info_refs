Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-21596:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `decode_CABAC_bit` function of the libde265 library.

**Vulnerability:**
- A global buffer overflow occurs due to improper bounds checking when accessing the `next_state_MPS` and `next_state_LPS` global arrays in `cabac.cc` during decoding of a bitstream.

**Impact:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) due to the program crashing with a global buffer overflow. The advisory also mentions "potentially the execution of arbitrary code", however, there are no details in this information about this impact

**Attack Vector:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted H.265 video file.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious H.265 video file to a vulnerable application that uses the `libde265` library.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was discovered through fuzzing.
- The vulnerability is located in `cabac.cc`, specifically line 180 in `decode_CABAC_bit` function.
- The overflow occurs when reading from the `next_state_MPS` and `next_state_LPS` global arrays, with a read occurring 31 bytes beyond the end of `next_state_MPS`.
- The issue was fixed in `libde265` version 1.0.11-0+deb11u1 for Debian bullseye and 1.0.3-1+deb10u2 for Debian buster LTS.
