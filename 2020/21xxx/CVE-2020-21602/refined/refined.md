Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21602:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback` function within the libde265 library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, where a write operation attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. Specifically, a write of size 2 bytes occurs at an address that is outside of the allocated memory region for a buffer of size 25360, allocated by thread T0.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The heap-buffer-overflow causes the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While the provided information only shows a crash, heap overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if crafted carefully.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed HEVC/H.265 video file: The vulnerability is triggered when decoding a specially crafted HEVC/H.265 video file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable software with a specially crafted HEVC/H.265 video file. This could happen when a user opens a malicious video file or if the software processes a video file from an untrusted source.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided ASan (AddressSanitizer) output pinpoints the exact line of code and function causing the crash: `fallback-motion.cc:223` in `put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback`.
- The function `put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback` is part of the fallback motion compensation routines.
- The provided crash input `libde265-put_weighted_bipred_16_fallback-heap_overflow.crash` can be used to trigger the vulnerability for testing and analysis.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 5346-1) confirms that multiple security issues were fixed, including CVE-2020-21602. The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability could lead to denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution if a malformed media file is processed.
