## Description

![@T3qui1a](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17540142?u=9c369adae725000f5eeb1300bb9fa77764bdd0b7&v=4&size=48)[T3qui1a](https://github.com/T3qui1a)opened [on Nov 29, 2019](https://github.com/youseries/ureport/issues/484#issue-530161732)

With the following source code, we can easily find that the 'class. Forname' method can load malicious classes.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17540142/69845356-60be1900-12ab-11ea-8e5f-2add90c11d26.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17540142/69845356-60be1900-12ab-11ea-8e5f-2add90c11d26.png)

'Class.forname' is a method for JVM to retrieve and load into memory. In this process, the static phase of loading class will be executed.

In other words, if a malicious class is defined in advance, you can execute the static code block of the malicious class here.

We successfully execute the code by loading the malicious classes set in advance.
