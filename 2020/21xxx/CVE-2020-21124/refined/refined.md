```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses `Class.forName` to load classes based on user-controlled input, allowing for arbitrary class loading and execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Uncontrolled class loading via `Class.forName`",
    "Unauthorized access to a designer page"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution through loading and executing malicious classes. The attacker can run malicious code on the server hosting the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends crafted input to a page that utilizes the vulnerable `Class.forName` method, specifying a malicious class to load.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable designer page and inject malicious input into the class name field to be loaded. The attacker must also be able to provide or have access to a malicious class definition."
