- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to CSRF and XSS attacks. Specifically, the `admin.php/admin/type/info.html` endpoint does not have adequate CSRF protection. Additionally, user-supplied data in the `type_en` parameter is not sanitized, allowing for XSS injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **CSRF:** Lack of CSRF protection at the `admin.php/admin/type/info.html` endpoint allows an attacker to forge requests.
    - **XSS:** The application does not sanitize user input provided via the `type_en` parameter, making it vulnerable to stored XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use CSRF to trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions, like creating a new classification with malicious content. The XSS vulnerability in the "english name" field allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the administrator's browser session, leading to session hijacking (cookie theft) and privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page (e.g., `test2.html`) containing a form that sends a POST request to `admin.php/admin/type/info.html` with attacker-controlled values.
    - **XSS:** The payload ` " onmouseover=alert(document.cookie) "` is injected into the `type_en` field, which is later rendered unsanitized in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page (or have a way to inject the malicious form into a page the admin visits).
    - The attacker needs to know the location of vulnerable endpoint `admin.php/admin/type/info.html` and the structure of required POST parameters.
