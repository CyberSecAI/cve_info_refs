The provided content is related to CVE-2020-21523.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in the Freemarker template engine used by the Halo blogging platform.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Freemarker templates.
- The ability to edit Freemarker template files in the "Edit Theme File" function allows malicious users to inject arbitrary code.
- Lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-provided Freemarker template code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious Freemarker code.
- Full compromise of the server running the Halo application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the "Edit Theme File" function, which allows editing of ftl files.
- The injected code is executed when a rendered page such as an arbitrary 404 page is visited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires a user to have access to the "Edit Theme File" function in the Halo admin panel.
- The attacker must be able to save the modified template.
