Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-21967

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper file content checks and improper output handling in the file upload functionality within the PrestaShop catalog feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the application allows users to upload files (specifically .html files) with malicious content and then executes this content when a user views the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that could steal user cookies.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can perform a range of malicious actions within the context of the user who views the malicious content, such as redirecting to a phishing site, modifying data, or taking over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript code using the file upload feature in the Catalog section.
- **User Interaction:** The malicious code executes when a customer views the uploaded file through the product page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload files via the catalog feature. In this case, the attacker is likely a back-office user.
- **Knowledge of File Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs to be aware of the file upload functionality within the catalog feature and the fact that it doesn't properly sanitize/validate the file content.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs the ability to create an HTML file containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific version affected is PrestaShop 1.7.6.7.
* The vulnerability is located within the catalog file upload functionality.
* The CVSS score provided (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N) indicates a high severity rating due to high confidentiality and integrity impact. Although the attack complexity is high and requires high privileges, the scope of the attack is changed, meaning that the code can have an impact outside of the security context of the vulnerable component.
*   The issue was reported to PrestaShop but was labeled "No change required" and closed as "expected as is". This implies that the developers decided not to fix the issue, possibly due to the assumption that only trusted users would be able to upload files. However, if a back-office user account is compromised, this issue could be exploited.
