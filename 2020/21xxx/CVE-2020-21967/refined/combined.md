## Description

![@p1nk15amak](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49667959?u=9ad9efacc7a2183e7af17923256ae1159120f935&v=4&size=48)[p1nk15amak](https://github.com/p1nk15amak)opened [on Jul 23, 2020](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/20306#issue-664648405)

An issue is discovered in PrestaShop version 1.7.6.7 under the Catelog feature when using the file-upload functionality for uploading the Files for various products. This issue exists because it fails to implement file content checks and improperly handles the output, resulting in cross-site scripting attack that leads to cookie stealing or malicious actions.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to Catelog feature
2. Click on File component and add the details accordingly.
3. Create a file with .html extension and enter the payload
   <script>alert('XSS!!');</script>within it. (Here its, uplod.html)
4. Upload the file
5. Login as customer and click on the file uploaded for the particular product.
6. You can see the XSS payload gets executed.
