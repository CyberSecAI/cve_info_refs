Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-21120

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the construction of SQL queries using untrusted input, specifically the `cookie_cart` parameter, within the `home\controls\cart.class.php` file of the UQCMS application. The application directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `cookie_cart` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. The application then uses the results of the first query to construct a new query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code can be inserted into the query through the `cookie_cart` parameter. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify the meaning of the SQL instructions or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- Potential for data exfiltration, modification, or deletion
- Potential to gain unauthorized access to the database server
- Could be used to escalate privileges within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to `/index.php/cart/num`.
- Malicious Cookie: The attack vector specifically utilizes a modified cookie named `cookie_cart`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests.
- Ability to modify the cookie header in the HTTP request, specifically the `cookie_cart` parameter.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and how it is used to build a SQL query.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerable file is `home\controls\cart.class.php`.
- The vulnerable version is UQCMS 2.1.3.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) is provided in the issue report with a malicious payload in the `cookie_cart` cookie parameter. This payload uses `updatexml()` to retrieve the database user.
- The content provides a link to OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet for recommended mitigation steps.
