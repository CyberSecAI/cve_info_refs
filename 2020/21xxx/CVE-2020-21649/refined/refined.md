The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Myucms v2.2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `/application/admin/controller/index.php` file's `sql()` method directly uses user-provided input to make an HTTP request without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows an attacker to control the URL used in a server-side HTTP request.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `sql` parameter, allowing it to be any URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can make the server send HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs.
- This can lead to:
    - Information disclosure by accessing internal resources or services not meant to be exposed publicly.
    - Port scanning of internal network and possible access to internal systems.
    - Potentially leveraging the server to make requests to internal endpoints, which might lead to further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a POST request to `/admin.php/index/sql` with a crafted URL in the `sql` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Myucms application. This likely requires having valid admin credentials.
