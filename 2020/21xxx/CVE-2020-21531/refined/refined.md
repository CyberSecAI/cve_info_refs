Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-21531:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Global buffer overflow in the `conv_pattern_index()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** A global buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling pattern indices within the `conv_pattern_index()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial-of-Service:** Exploiting the buffer overflow can lead to a denial-of-service.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The advisory mentions "other unspecified impact", which could mean other potential consequences such as arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the processing of specially crafted XFig figure files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XFig figure file to be processed by the vulnerable `fig2dev` utility. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening a malicious file or by exploiting a service using `fig2dev` to convert user-supplied files.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in `fig2dev`, a utility for converting XFig figure files.
*   The provided advisories highlight that this CVE was addressed in `fig2dev` version `1:3.2.6a-2+deb9u4` for Debian 9 (stretch) and `1:3.2.7a-5+deb10u5` for Debian 10 (buster).
*  The fix was released as part of Debian LTS advisories DLA-2778-1 and DLA-3304-1
