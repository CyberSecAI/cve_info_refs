Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `add_to_cart` action of the `flow` controller within the `ectouch-master` application.
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `goods` parameter of the POST request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize the input provided through the `goods` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the ability to:
    - Determine the length of the database name.
    - Extract the database name character by character.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as database names, table names, and user credentials.
- **Data Modification:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to craft queries to cause performance issues or other denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`index.php?m=default&c=flow&a=add_to_cart`).
- **`goods` parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payload is injected within the `goods` parameter, specifically within the `goods_id` field of the JSON structure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with a specific payload in the `goods` parameter.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to know SQL to construct appropriate queries for information extraction or other malicious operations.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided PoC is written in Python and uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests.
- The PoC uses `urllib.parse.quote` to encode the payload in the `goods` parameter, which is necessary for the request to be parsed correctly by the application.
- The PoC uses a technique to detect the SQL injection by checking for the `cart_number` string in the response.
- The vulnerable code is part of the `ectouch-master` application.
