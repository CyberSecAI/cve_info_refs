- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SystemDatabackup` controller's `seetable` function in the CRMEB system does not perform any security checks on the incoming `tablename` parameter. This parameter is directly used in a database query without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The lack of input sanitization on the `tablename` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion. In the provided example, the attacker is able to extract the database user.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET request to the `seetable` function within the `SystemDatabackup` controller, specifically by manipulating the `tablename` parameter. Example vulnerable URL: `http://localhost/admin/system.systemdatabackup/seetable?tablename=1`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator (cookies are required).
