{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The application discloses whether a user exists or not via the login error message. Specifically, it returns the message “Account does not exist” if a username is not found, and “wrong password” if the account exists but the password is incorrect.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "User enumeration vulnerability through differential error messages on login attempts."
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can identify valid usernames through a brute force approach.",
    "Attack vectors": "The login form on the guestbook page (<http://demo.8cms.com/index.php?c=guestbook>). The vulnerability is triggered when submitting a login request with incorrect credentials.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the login form and send HTTP requests. They also need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests in order to conduct the attack, which typically involves a tool like Burp Suite."
