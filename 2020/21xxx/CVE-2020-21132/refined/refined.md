Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `login_by_password` function of the Metinfo 7.0.0beta CMS. This function uses user-controlled input (specifically the username) directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the injection vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the username field during login, manipulating database queries and potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The CMS uses an encrypted cookie for authentication, but the encryption key is easily disclosed through a publicly accessible configuration file (`/config/config_safe.php`). This allows attackers to generate valid authentication cookies.
*  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the SQL query, thus leading to the SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database.
*   **Account Takeover:** By manipulating the SQL query, an attacker might be able to bypass the login system and gain administrative access.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on database configuration and privileges, SQL injection could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed by sending HTTP requests with a crafted `acc_auth` cookie.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the insecure cookie handling and generates the authentication cookie with the injected payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the key:** The attacker needs to know the encryption key, which can be obtained from the publicly accessible config file (`/config/config_safe.php`).
*   **Ability to craft cookie:** The attacker needs to encrypt a malicious payload using the key.
*   **Ability to send crafted HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server with a specially crafted cookie.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Metinfo instance to send HTTP requests.

**Summary of Attack Steps**

1.  **Get the encryption key:** Obtain the key from the `/config/config_safe.php` file.
2.  **Craft SQL Injection Payload:** Prepare a SQL injection payload to be used as a username, such as `username' OR 1=1-- -`.
3.  **Encrypt payload:**  Use the `authcode` function (provided in the content) to encrypt the SQL payload using the retrieved key and the constant `abcd`.
4.  **Send the Malicious Request:** Craft the HTTP request with the `acc_auth` cookie containing the encrypted payload and send it to the server, triggering the SQL injection when the `login_by_password` function is called.
