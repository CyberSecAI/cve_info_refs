  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Stack buffer overflow in the `put_qpel_fallback` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `put_qpel_fallback` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when decoding a specially crafted HEVC video file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious HEVC file to be processed by the vulnerable software."
