The provided content describes three Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Waimai Super Cms.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerabilities stem from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input within the application, specifically:
  - The `Referer` header
  - The `page` parameter in a URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects unsanitized input from the `Referer` header and the `page` parameter back to the user's browser.
  - **Lack of Input Sanitization/Encoding:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode the user-provided data before embedding it in the HTML response, leading to the execution of injected JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access a vulnerable page.
  - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the application.
  - **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious sites.
  - **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the visual appearance of a website.
  - **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal data from the webpage or the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP Referer header:** The attacker crafts a malicious `Referer` header with an XSS payload that the application reflects in the response.
  - **URL Parameters:** The attacker crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `page` parameter, which is reflected in the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, including setting a `Referer` header or URL parameters.
  - No special privileges or authentication are explicitly stated to be required to trigger these XSS vulnerabilities in this context, though the application itself might require authentication for full impact.
