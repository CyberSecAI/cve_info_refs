Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21697:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `mpeg_mux_write_packet` function within `libavformat/mpegenc.c`. This occurs when the MPEG-PS muxer attempts to access memory after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free. This means a pointer to a memory location is still used after that memory has been deallocated/freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to a crash (denial of service).
- It could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided text.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted AVI file that is then converted to an MPEG file using the `-c copy` option which uses the MPEG-PS muxer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious AVI file that can trigger the vulnerability in FFmpeg during the muxing process into a MPEG-PS container.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified using AddressSanitizer (ASAN).
- The issue is related to how the MPEG-PS muxer manages its internal packet queues.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `cfce16449cb815132f829d5a07beb138dfb2cba6`, which ensured the packet queue remains valid.
- This CVE is included in the Debian Security Advisory DSA-4998-1, indicating its importance for the security of Debian systems using FFmpeg.
