The content is related to CVE-2020-21526.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal bypass in the backend file writing interface. The application uses a `startsWith` function to check for directory traversal, but this check can be bypassed by including `../` sequences within the path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability
- Insufficient input validation
- Use of insecure `startsWith` check

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the server. This could include configuration files, executable files, or other sensitive data, potentially leading to:
- Arbitrary code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data corruption or loss
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP PUT request to the `/api/admin/themes/caicai_anatole/files/content` endpoint with a malicious `path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application's server.
- The attacker must have an `Admin-Authorization` header.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the application file system.
