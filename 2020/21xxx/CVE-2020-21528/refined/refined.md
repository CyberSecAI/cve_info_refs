Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21528:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a segmentation fault occurring in the `ieee_segment()` function within the NASM assembler. Specifically, the issue arises because the name for a section is not updated correctly during processing in the IEEE output format. This leads to a null pointer dereference when `strcmp` is called with a null pointer as argument.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The primary weakness is a null pointer dereference due to an incorrect section name causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the NASM assembler to crash. This could be exploited to prevent users from assembling code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious assembly file: The attacker provides a specially crafted assembly file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by NASM with the `-f ieee` option.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted assembly file to be processed by a vulnerable version of NASM. This can be achieved by enticing a user to process the crafted assembly file, or by integrating it in a workflow that uses the vulnerable NASM version.

**Additional details:**
- The provided bug report indicates that the issue was identified by a user named Suhwan on 2019-12-08, with a provided proof-of-concept (PoC) file triggering the vulnerability with a specific command (`nasm -f ieee -o /dev/null $PoC`).
- The bug was fixed in commit `93c774d482694643cafbc82578ac8b729fb5bc8b` after being bisected to commit `98578071b9d71ecaa2344dd9c185237c1765041e`.
- The vulnerable versions are reported as including `2.15.xx` and `nasm-2.14.03rc2`. The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that versions prior to `2.16.01` are affected.

The Gentoo Security Advisory, associated with GLSA 202312-09, also indicates that this vulnerability can be exploited both locally and remotely. However, based on the bug report, local exploitation is more clearly described. Remote exploitation might be feasible through scenarios where NASM is used to process files from untrusted sources, such as when building software.
