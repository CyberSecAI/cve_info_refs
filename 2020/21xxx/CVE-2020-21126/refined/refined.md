```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `admin/?n=admin&c=index&a=doSaveInfo` endpoint when updating an admin user account.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application is vulnerable to CSRF. The `doSaveInfo` endpoint lacks proper CSRF protection, making it susceptible to malicious requests triggered from a different origin.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the admin user's password, name, and other details by tricking a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions, potentially leading to account takeover.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page, which will then submit a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page with a crafted form to submit the malicious request. The attacker does not need direct access to the application's server."
