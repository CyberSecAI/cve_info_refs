The provided content describes three XSS vulnerabilities in Waimai Super Cms.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input within the application. Specifically, the `Referer` header and the `page` parameter in URLs are not properly handled, leading to injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web application.
- This code could be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Performing actions on behalf of a user
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website

**Attack vectors:**
-  HTTP `Referer` header: The attacker crafts a malicious `Referer` header in their HTTP request.
-  URL parameters: Specifically the `page` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `Referer` header or `page` parameter within these requests.
- No special privileges within the application seem to be required, as these are unauthenticated injection points.
