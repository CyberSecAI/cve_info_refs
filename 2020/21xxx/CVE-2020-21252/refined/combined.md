## Description

![@eqwadasd](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42021243?v=4&size=48)[eqwadasd](https://github.com/eqwadasd)opened [on Nov 11, 2019](https://github.com/Neeke/HongCMS/issues/13#issue-520843704)

CSRF exists in the background (administrator) to delete users:

The backend only cares about the values of the parameters' deleteuserids' and 'updateuserids'

So the attacker only needs to know the user's ID to construct a malicious link to complete the intrusion

The following is a normal request packet for deleting user operations。

I use this request package to construct a malicious html interface and only add the required parameters.

When a user with administrative rights clicks on this malicious link, the user (id=3) is successfully deleted.
