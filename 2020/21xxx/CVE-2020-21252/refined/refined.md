- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the user deletion functionality within the administrative backend.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability. The backend only checks the values of `deleteuserids` and `updateuserids` parameters without proper CSRF token verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick an authenticated administrator into deleting user accounts without their consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a request to delete a user with the `deleteuserids` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint. This can be distributed via a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the target user's ID and must trick an authenticated administrator into clicking the malicious link.
