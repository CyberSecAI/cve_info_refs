Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `app/admin/controller/Ajax.php` file, specifically on line 145. The 'table' parameter, received via a POST request, is directly used in an SQL query without proper filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the 'table' parameter, manipulating the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which may lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Extracting sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining higher levels of access.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Manipulating the database to cause malfunctions or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a malicious POST request to the `/admin/ajax/weigh` endpoint.
*   **Malicious 'table' Parameter:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `table` parameter within the POST request data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Account:** The attacker needs to be logged into the system with an administrator account in the background, This indicates that the vulnerability is triggered by administrator actions or by the administrator interface.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL `/admin/ajax/weigh`.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** Basic skills to send HTTP POST requests with a crafted body.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the `updatexml` function and `if` conditional to extract database information, specifically the current user.
*   The `user_rule` table is targeted in the example.
*   The `weigh` action in the `Ajax` controller is vulnerable.
