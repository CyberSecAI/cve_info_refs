The provided content describes a vulnerability in fluentd-ui versions 0.12-1.0, which is related to CVE-2020-21514 based on the description.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of a default "admin/changeme" password in fluentd-ui and the presence of a built-in command execution plugin (`in_exec`) in Fluentd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The software ships with a default username ("admin") and password ("changeme"). If not changed after initial deployment, it allows unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The `in_exec` plugin allows the execution of arbitrary commands on the system running Fluentd.
*   **Lack of Default Security:** The `in_exec` plugin is enabled by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker who gains access using the default credentials can leverage the `in_exec` plugin to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where fluentd-ui is running. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs network access to the fluentd-ui instance (typically exposed on port 9292 by default) to attempt login using default credentials and then exploit the `in_exec` plugin.
* **Web Interface:** The attacker interacts with the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the fluentd-ui instance over the network.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must be aware of the default "admin/changeme" credentials (or gain it through reconnaissance).
*   **Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to interact with the web interface to log in and configure the command execution plugin.
