  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows uploading files and doesn't properly validate the file type. By changing the file extension, an attacker can upload a PHP file as an image and then execute it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Lack of file type validation",
    "Arbitrary code execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Upload of a malicious file with a manipulated file extension (e.g., changing .php to .jpg).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the affected web application."
