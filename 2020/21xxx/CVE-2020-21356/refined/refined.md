The provided content describes a vulnerability related to a host path leak in the `upload.php` file of PopojiCMS version 1.2.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability occurs when the `name` parameter is removed during a file upload request to `upload.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability leads to a host physical path disclosure. This is because removing the `name` parameter results in the server revealing the server's file path in an error message.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure by exploiting this vulnerability. This information could be used to further target the system with more advanced attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves manipulating the file upload request by removing the `name` parameter from the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make file upload requests to the `upload.php` file. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be authenticated.
