The provided content contains information about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in JIZHICMS 1.5.1, specifically related to adding an administrator cookie. This aligns with the provided CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when creating or viewing articles, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, as the injected script is stored in the database and executed each time the affected page is loaded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Administrator Cookie Stealing:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can steal cookies of administrators who visit the page, allowing the attacker to impersonate them.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript can also be used to perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Article Creation:** A normal user creates a new article.
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** The user includes a malicious script such as `<script>alert(1)</script>` within the title or content of the article.
*   **Admin Accessing Article:**  When an administrator views the article, the injected script is executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs a user account capable of creating articles.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of how to inject HTML/JavaScript into the article creation fields.
*   An administrator must then visit the page with the injected script.
