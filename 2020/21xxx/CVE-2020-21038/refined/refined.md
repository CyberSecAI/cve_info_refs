The provided content is related to CVE-2020-21038.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the `referer` parameter in the login process. After a successful login, the application redirects the user to the URL specified in the `referer` parameter if it's not empty. This allows an attacker to control the redirect URL, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The application uses the `referer` parameter without proper sanitization to construct the redirect URL. The `safeUrl` function performs some filtering but does not prevent redirect to arbitrary external URLs.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Although the `safeUrl` function performs some sanitization of the URL, it does not enforce that the redirect occurs within the application's domain. It only checks for valid schemes (http/https) and removes some characters that could be used for XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL with a controlled `referer` parameter to redirect users to a phishing page. After the user logs in, they are redirected to the malicious page, which might look like the legitimate login page of the application, and they are tricked into providing credentials to the attacker.
- **Credentials Theft:** The attacker can set up a similar domain to the legitimate one, redirect users to a fake login page on that domain, and record user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Manipulated `referer` parameter:** The attacker crafts a URL that contains a malicious redirect URL in the `referer` parameter.
- **User interaction:** The attacker tricks the user into accessing the crafted URL, usually through a phishing email or link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the `referer` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick the user to visit the malicious URL before the user logs into the application.
- No privileged access to the server is needed.

The provided text also includes a Proof of Concept (PoC):
```
http://127.0.0.1/admin/login.php?referer=http://www.baidu.com
```

The text also suggests a fix which includes:
1. Validating that after login, the referer address is within the same domain
2. Allow redirects only within the application's domain.
