The provided content details a vulnerability in Myucms v2.2, specifically within the `addqq()` method of the `config.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input being directly used in a `file_put_contents` function, which allows for arbitrary PHP code injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsanitized user input: The `qq-appid` parameter from the GET request is not sanitized before being used to construct a string that will be written to a file.
- Arbitrary code injection: By injecting PHP code within the `qq-appid` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution on the server with the privileges of the webserver. This can result in a complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker makes a GET request to `admin.php/config/addqq` with a malicious payload in the `qq-appid` parameter.
- The application writes this malicious payload into the `qq.php` file.
- The attacker then makes a request to the `qq.php` file with the `ha` parameter containing the command they wish to execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in to the admin panel to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
