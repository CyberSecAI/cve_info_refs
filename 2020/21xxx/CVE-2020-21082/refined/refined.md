The provided content describes CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in maccms8, which can be combined to steal user and administrator cookies.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Lack of input sanitization allows for XSS attacks.
- Lack of CSRF protection allows for unauthorized actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the article management section, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This is present in both the admin panel (article management) and front-end when displaying article titles. Specifically, the `t_name` and `t_enname` parameters are vulnerable.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application lacks CSRF protection for the article category add/modify functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript to steal user cookies, including admin cookies, when a user hovers their mouse over the affected elements, potentially allowing them to hijack sessions.
- **CSRF:** An attacker can trick an administrator into performing unwanted actions by crafting malicious links or forms. For example, adding article categories with malicious XSS payloads.
- **Combined CSRF and XSS:** By combining both vulnerabilities, the attacker can use CSRF to inject XSS payloads which steal user or admin cookies, without the victim knowing, by loading a crafted page which automatically submits the form.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into article category names (Chinese and English) in the admin panel. The code is then executed when a user views the affected elements.
- **CSRF:** Crafting a malicious HTML page with a form that makes a request to add or modify article categories, and tricking an authenticated admin to access it.
- **Combined CSRF and XSS:** Using an iframe to submit a malicious request, leading to stored XSS execution and cookie stealing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **XSS:** Ability to create content within the CMS by exploiting the lack of input sanitization.
- **CSRF:** Ability to create a malicious webpage and lure a logged-in administrator to visit it.
- **Combined CSRF and XSS:** Ability to perform a CSRF attack combined with XSS injection.
