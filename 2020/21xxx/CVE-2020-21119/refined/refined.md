The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `admin_update_module_widgets.php` file of the Kliqqi-CMS project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `$recordIDValue` parameter in the SQL query is not properly sanitized or enclosed in single quotes, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied input (`$recordIDValue`) in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.
- The impact includes:
    - Time-based SQL injection is possible, allowing attackers to extract information.
    - Potential to modify or delete data.
    - Full database takeover if the web application database user has sufficient rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `admin_update_module_widgets.php` file.
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `$recordIDValue` parameter.
- The attacker would need to send a malicious crafted request with SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `admin_update_module_widgets.php` script.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and SQL injection techniques.
