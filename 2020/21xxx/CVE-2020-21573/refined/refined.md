The provided content is a GitHub issue page discussing a stack exhaustion error in an image processing project. However, it does not contain any information about a specific vulnerability described by CVE-2020-21573. The issue is about a potential bug in the code causing a stack overflow.

Based on the content:
- Root cause of the issue: The use of a large, locally defined buffer on the stack in the image processing code, causing a stack overflow with large input files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: The stack exhaustion is not a typical vulnerability but a programming error that can cause the application to crash.
- Impact of the issue: Program crash (stack exhaustion).
- Attack vectors: Providing a sufficiently large input image.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to provide input to the program.

While the issue describes a bug causing a crash, this is not related to a vulnerability described by a CVE.
