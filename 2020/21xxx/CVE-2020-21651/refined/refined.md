The provided content relates to CVE-2020-21651.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `add()` method in `WWW\application\admin\controller\point.php` of Myucms v2.2 does not sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically the `JIFENNAME` parameter is directly inserted into the database without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of input sanitization allows for SQL injection by injecting arbitrary SQL commands via the `JIFENNAME` parameter.
- Arbitrary Command Execution: The SQL injection allows the attacker to execute PHP code via functions such as `phpinfo()` due to the lack of sanitization of input written to database and subsequently executed when visiting extra/point.php.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- Information disclosure: Attackers may be able to extract sensitive information from the database or the server.
- System compromise: The attacker could potentially gain full control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `admin.php/point/add` with a malicious `JIFENNAME` parameter.
- Visiting the page extra/point.php triggers the execution of the injected code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in to access the admin panel.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
