Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21041:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `apng_do_inverse_blend` function located in `libavcodec/pngenc.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability occurs when comparing pixel data during the inverse blending process in the `apng_do_inverse_blend` function. Specifically, the `memcmp` function might read out of bounds, due to the calculation of `bpp * x` exceeding the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A remote malicious user can trigger a crash, potentially leading to a denial of service.
- **Memory corruption:** As a heap-based buffer overflow, it may also lead to memory corruption and potentially other issues

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) file. Specifically, it occurs when converting a PBM file to an APNG file using the provided ffmpeg command line.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted or malformed input file (specifically PBM).
- The attacker needs to have the target application (ffmpeg) process this file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was initially reported with a crash report involving `free(): invalid pointer`.
- The bug was fixed by commit `5d9f44da460f781a1604d537d0555b78e29438ba` which removed monowhite pixel format support for APNG encoding
- The vulnerability was present in the `git-master` version of ffmpeg before the fix.
- The Debian security advisories (DLA-2742-1 and DSA-4990-1) lists this CVE as one of the security issues addressed by the updates.
