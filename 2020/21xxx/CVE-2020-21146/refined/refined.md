- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying it, specifically when rendering usernames within blog posts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web application. This could result in various impacts, including but not limited to: session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and other malicious activities within the context of the application user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through user registration or login, where a malicious payload such as `<script>alert(1)</script>` is injected into the username field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to register/login to the site, using the malicious payload in the username field. They do not need prior access and can perform this attack as an external actor.
