Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-21365

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient restrictions of the same-origin policy within wkhtmltopdf. This allowed HTML files loaded from the `file` domain to access local files on the system, effectively bypassing expected security boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Same-Origin Policy:** The core weakness was a lax implementation of the same-origin policy, which should prevent scripts from one origin (e.g., a local file) from accessing resources from another origin (e.g., other local files).
- **Unrestricted Local File Access:** This allowed an attacker to craft a malicious HTML file that could read arbitrary local files on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker could read sensitive files on the victim's system, including configuration files, user data, or other confidential information. In the provided example, the `/etc/passwd` file is read, which could expose usernames.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Exposing files could provide additional information that could be used to launch more sophisticated attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML file that contains JavaScript code to read local files.
- **wkhtmltopdf Processing:** The victim must use the `wkhtmltopdf` tool to process the malicious HTML file, converting it to PDF, which would trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create or Supply Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to create or provide a crafted HTML file to the victim.
- **Victim Using wkhtmltopdf:** The victim must then use the vulnerable version of `wkhtmltopdf` to process the attacker-supplied HTML file.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by disabling local filesystem access by default. Users can enable it with the `--enable-local-file-access` or the `--allow <path>` options when necessary.
