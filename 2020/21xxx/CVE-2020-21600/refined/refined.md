Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability within the `put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback` function, specifically when decoding a crafted HEVC (H.265) video file. This overflow occurs due to incorrect calculations of buffer sizes or improper handling of input data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, which means that the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory region on the heap, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Incorrect buffer size calculation or handling:** The `put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback` function does not correctly calculate or handle the required buffer size, resulting in out-of-bounds write access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow, which leads to a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** This vulnerability could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on a target system if an attacker can carefully craft a malicious HEVC file to overwrite specific memory regions with attacker-controlled data, though this is not explicitly stated in this content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HEVC File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted HEVC video file. This file can trigger the vulnerability when processed by the vulnerable libde265 library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious HEVC File:** The attacker needs the capability to provide a malicious HEVC file to a system that is using the vulnerable libde265 library. This could involve serving the file over a network, via a website or through any other means that a user may access.
*   **Target System Must Process the File:** The attacker has to trick the targeted system into processing the crafted HEVC file with the vulnerable `libde265` library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `fallback-motion.cc` file in the `put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback` function at line 246.
*   The provided ASan output shows the specific memory location where the heap-buffer-overflow occurs and provides a call stack leading to the vulnerable function.
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) file is available to trigger this vulnerability, named `libde265-put_weighted_pred_avg_16_fallback-heap_overflow.crash`, which is packaged in a zip archive with password `leon.zhao.7`.
*   The issue was found during fuzzing, an automated testing technique for finding software vulnerabilities.
