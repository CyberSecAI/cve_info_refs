Manjit Singh, *IT Manager Corporate,*Sayaji Group

### Superior Technology

WiFiLAN is a vital part of our operation. We use WiFiLAN for support and for monitoring information. We have about 200 locations that we use to monitor our Wi-Fi systems. It enables us to give various reports to our customers as far as daily login reports , monthly reports, yearly reports and various other reports. I personally have been using WiFiLAN for about seven years. It makes us look very good as a business and very well organized. I've enjoyed over the past seven years working with Wifisoft team. They make it very easy to work with. They are on time doing things we ask. Like specially programing that we need to have done. Customize our reports that we need to have laid out differently. There are so many other functions of WiFiLAN. Companies that do advertising can get even more deeper is customizing and monitoring activities.

Authenticated XSRF leads to complete Account Takeover
=====================================================
```

. contents:: Table Of Content

Overview
========

Title:- Authenticated XSRF leads to complete account takeover in all
UNIBOX WiFi Hotspot Controller.
CVE ID:- Not -Yet - Assign
Author: Kaustubh G. Padwad
Vendor: Wifi-soft (<https://www.wifi-soft.com/>)
Products:
     1.Unibox SMB
     2.UniBox - Enterprise Series
     3.UniBox - Campus Series

Tested Version: :Controller Model : U-50 | UniBox 2.4 (Respetive for others)
Severity: High--Critical

Advisory ID
============
KSA-Dev-008

About the Product:
==================
UniBox is one of the most innovative and reliable Hotspot Controllers in
the market today. You can install UniBox to manage any sized WiFi
network without having to replace any existing infrastructure. With
UniBox, you don't need any other solution for managing WiFi access. It
comes packed with features so just one box is enough to handle all the
functions of WiFi hotspots.

Description:
============
An issue was discovered on Unibox U-50 with version Unibox 2.4 and
poterntially respected all other  devices. There is CSRF via
/tools/network-trace with resultant XSS due to  lack of csrf token and
user input validation.

Additional Information
======================
The web interface of the SMB Unibox  does not validate the csrftoken,and
the /tools/network-trace  page does not properly sanitize the
user input which leads to xss, By combining this two attack we can form
the XSRF request which leads to complete account takeover using XSRF.
