The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `yiicms` project, specifically in the News release functionality. This vulnerability is related to CVE-2020-21246.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it in the News release section. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code which is then executed by the browsers of users viewing the affected page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: The injected script is stored in the application's database and executed each time the page is accessed.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or encode user input before storing and rendering it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Session hijacking: An attacker could potentially steal session cookies.
- Account compromise: Malicious actions could be performed on behalf of the user, leading to account compromise.
- Defacement: An attacker could deface the website by altering the content.
- Phishing: An attacker could inject content that redirects the user to a malicious page.

**Attack vectors:**
- News release: The attacker injects the malicious script within the input field of the News release functionality.
- User interaction: When a user views the affected News release, the injected script gets executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create or modify News releases on the target system.
- No special position is required, the attacker must simply have the user-level privileges to interact with the affected functionality.
