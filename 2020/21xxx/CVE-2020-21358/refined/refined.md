{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection in the `/admin/users` endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions such as adding a new employee.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (csrf.html) that submits a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint. This page is then visited by a logged-in user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious HTML page (csrf.html). The attacker needs to know the structure of the request, which they can grab from legitimate requests."
