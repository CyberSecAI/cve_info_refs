Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper permissions in the installer for Intel(R) MPSS (Manycore Platform Software Stack) before version 3.8.6.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the installer's permission settings, which are not sufficiently restrictive. This allows a local user to potentially manipulate the installation process or installed files to gain elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Escalation of privilege: An authenticated user can gain higher privileges than they should have on the system. This could allow an attacker to perform actions that are normally restricted, potentially leading to complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user who has local access to the affected machine.
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an authenticated account on the system where Intel MPSS is installed.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the local system.
*   The attacker needs to perform a manual action for the vulnerability to be triggered (user interaction is required as stated in the CVSS vector: UI:R).

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.7 (Medium) with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This reflects the local attack vector, high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, the requirement for an authenticated user, and the need for user interaction for successful exploitation.
*   The vulnerability affects Intel MPSS versions prior to 3.8.6.
*   Intel recommends updating to version 3.8.6 or later to mitigate this issue.
