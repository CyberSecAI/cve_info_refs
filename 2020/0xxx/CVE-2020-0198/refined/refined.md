Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-0198:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `exif_data_load_data_content` function in the `exif-data.c` file of the `libexif` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer Overflow: Specifically, an integer overflow occurs when processing EXIF data, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The integer overflow can lead to a crash (specifically a UBSAN abort), causing a denial of service.
- Information Disclosure: Some sources suggest that an out-of-bounds read could also occur due to a missing bounds check which leads to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious EXIF Data: The vulnerability is triggered when processing specifically crafted EXIF data within an image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: While the exploit does require a user to interact with the crafted image (e.g. by opening the image with a vulnerable application), it doesn't seem to need any special privileges.
- Remote: The denial of service can occur remotely by having a user open the crafted image.

**Additional Details:**
- Patch: The vulnerability is addressed by a patch that prevents the integer overflow.  The fix was backported from commit `ce03ad7ef4e8aeefce79192bf5b6f69fae396f0c` from the upstream libexif repository.
- Affected Software: This vulnerability affects `libexif` across several distributions, including Android, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Gentoo.
- Android: It is included in the Pixel Update Bulletin of June 2020.
- Ubuntu: It was addressed in USN-4396-1.
- Fedora: It was addressed in updates FEDORA-2020-e99ef3282f (for Fedora 33) and FEDORA-2020-0aa0fc1b0c (for Fedora 32).
- Gentoo: It was addressed in GLSA 202011-19.

**In summary, CVE-2020-0198 is a moderate severity vulnerability caused by an integer overflow in `libexif` which can lead to a denial of service when processing maliciously crafted EXIF data. Successful exploitation requires a user to process a crafted image file.**
