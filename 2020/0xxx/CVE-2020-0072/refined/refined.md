Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2020-0072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) write in `rw_t2t_ndef.c` related to handling NFC (Near Field Communication) tags. Specifically, it occurs within the `rw_t2t_handle_tlv_detect_rsp` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OOB Write:**  The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write. The code improperly handles the size of the data being written during the processing of a Type 2 Tag NDEF message which allows writing outside of allocated buffers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially achieve remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. This means an attacker could take control of the device by executing arbitrary code, which could lead to device takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted NFC Tag:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious NFC tag containing specially formatted data. When a vulnerable device interacts with this tag, the OOB write is triggered.
- **NFC Interaction**: The attacker needs to be able to get the vulnerable device to interact with the crafted NFC tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within NFC range of the target device to initiate the attack.
- **Crafting Malicious NFC Tag:** The attacker must be capable of creating or modifying an NFC tag containing the malicious data.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content indicates that multiple similar vulnerabilities existed at the same time related to NFC handling (e.g., CVE-2020-0070, CVE-2020-0071, CVE-2020-0073).
- The issue was addressed in AOSP versions 8.0, 8.1, 9 and 10.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the Android Security Bulletin of April 2020.
