Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0142:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `rw_i93_sm_format` function within the NFC (Near Field Communication) component. Specifically, the commit message refers to "Prevent OOB read in rw_i93_sm_format".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: This means the software is trying to access memory outside the allocated buffer, which can lead to various security issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: As the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds *read*, it allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive data from memory. The severity is rated as Moderate for Information Disclosure (ID).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the NFC component, likely through crafted NFC tag interactions. The patch itself mentions the bug is triggered by `read i93 tag`, which points to the attacker sending a malformed i93 tag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable device's NFC interface, likely by presenting a specifically crafted NFC tag.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided text confirms that the patch was backported to address this issue by preventing the out-of-bounds read. The bug ID associated with this fix is 146435761. The patch also mentions a fix related to tag detection, suggesting the exploit is related to how the NFC subsystem detects and reads certain i93 tags.
- The vulnerability is categorized as an "ID" (Information Disclosure) issue with "Moderate" severity.
