- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The BIOS firmware for some Intel Processors is susceptible to vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is in the BIOS firmware for some Intel Processors.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring high privileges (PR:H) and low attack complexity (AC:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system with high privileges.
