{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Exif tags Make and Model could be undefined or lack string terminators, leading to out-of-bounds read when comparing their values to constant strings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Missing string terminators"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure due to out-of-bounds read.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a malformed EXIF image with undefined 'Make' and 'Model' tags or missing string terminators.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a crafted image file with malformed EXIF data."
