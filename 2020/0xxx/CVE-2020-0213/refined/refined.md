Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the handling of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) format conversions within the `libhevc` library. Specifically, the issue occurs when the width of the data being converted is less than 32 bits. The Neons SIMD functions, used for these conversions, do not support widths smaller than 32.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect width handling:** The code attempts to perform SIMD format conversion on data with widths less than 32 bits, which is not supported by the underlying SIMD functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure. Although it's not explicitly stated how this occurs, it suggests that by triggering the incorrect SIMD conversion, it can lead to revealing sensitive data that should not be accessible to the attacker or application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious media file:** The vulnerability can be exploited by processing a specially crafted media file that triggers the vulnerable code path. This could involve an attacker crafting a media file with specific encoding characteristics designed to cause the incorrect SIMD conversion.
- **Local Exploitation:**  As specified in the provided security bulletin, this can be triggered locally via an application, but could potentially also be triggered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a media file that triggers the vulnerable conversion process.
- They would either need to have access to an application to process the malicious file or have a means to get the targeted system to process a malicious file.
- They do not require elevated privileges to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is found in the `libhevc` library.
- The provided commit log indicates a fix that prevents the SIMD conversion from being called when the width is less than 32.
- This vulnerability is present in Android versions 10 and 11.
- The fix is included in the Google Play System updates for media codecs.
