    "related": true,
    "summary": "This CVE relates to an information disclosure vulnerability in the Android Framework. An app can access certain identifiers without proper permissions due to a side channel.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "Information Disclosure",
        "description": "The vulnerability allows an app to access the device's identifiers without the necessary permissions.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a side channel, where information can be accessed through a method not intended or protected by the permission system.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper access control",
          "Side channel vulnerability"
        ],
          "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to device identifiers, potentially leading to user tracking and profiling.",

      {
          "type":"General Description",
          "description":"The research paper '50 Ways to Leak Your Data: An Exploration of Appsâ€™ Circumvention of the Android Permissions System' discusses several side and covert channels that allow apps to bypass the Android permission model. One specific side channel described allows apps to access device identifiers without proper permissions. The paper details dynamic and static analysis techniques used to discover these vulnerabilities in real-world applications."

         {
        "type": "Specific example",
        "description": "One identified vulnerability is through the use of ioctl system calls by the Unity game engine, allowing apps to obtain device MAC addresses without the required ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission.",
           "details": "The Unity game engine uses ioctl calls (SIOCGIFCONF2 and SIOCGIFHWADDR) to obtain the MAC address of the WiFi network interface, bypassing the need for explicit permissions."
