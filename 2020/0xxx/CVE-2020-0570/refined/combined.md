The patch just make sure that we don't do wrong call when the search prefixes
contains '/'
But before 5.12 (commit 5219c37f7c98f37f078fee00fe8ca35d83ff4f5d), there were
no search prefixes with '/' in them.
So no need to apply the patch in earlier versions.

#### Description

With strace, it is visible that Qt (installed in /usr/lib64) tries to load a plugin relative to the current directory:

```
~> strace -fefile qdbusviewer |& grep -i hasw
[pid  3055] openat(AT_FDCWD, "haswell/libXcursor.so.1", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden)
[pid  3055] openat(AT_FDCWD, "haswell/libXcursor", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden)

```

This is undesirable as the CWD contents can be unknown, so it might be finding something which it's not supposed to.
