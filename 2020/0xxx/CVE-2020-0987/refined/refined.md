Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the processing of Enhanced Metafile (EMF) images. Specifically, a crafted `EMR_SETDIBITSTODEVICE` record in an EMF image can cause a read operation to go beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** This is the primary vulnerability. The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of an allocated buffer.
- **Improper handling of EMF images:** The vulnerability arises during the processing of EMF images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The immediate impact is the disclosure of sensitive information, as the out-of-bounds read could potentially reveal data in memory that the attacker should not have access to.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** The advisory mentions that an attacker can potentially use this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User interaction required:** The attacker needs to induce the target user to either open a malicious EMF file or visit a malicious website serving a crafted EMF image.
- **Malicious EMF file:** A specially crafted EMF file is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or host a malicious EMF file.
- No special privileges are required, but the attack depends on user interaction.

**Additional Information:**
- There are two advisories for this CVE, both describing an out-of-bounds read due to a crafted `EMR_SETDIBITSTODEVICE` record.
- The first advisory (ZDI-20-876) states the vulnerability exists in `mf3216.dll`.
- The second advisory (ZDI-20-647) states the vulnerability exists in `gdi32full.dll`.
- Both advisories say that an attacker could leverage this in combination with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.
