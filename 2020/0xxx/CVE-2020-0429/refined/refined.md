{
  "CVE-2020-0429": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when calculating inline data size in f2fs due to a fuzzed `i_extra_isize` value.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of privilege due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can cause an integer overflow by providing a crafted `i_extra_isize` value. The exact method isn't specified, but it could be triggered through filesystem manipulation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker likely needs to have some level of control over the filesystem or its metadata, possibly through a malicious process, or by mounting a crafted image."
