  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The system tracing app was intended to be accessible only when development options were enabled, but this requirement could be bypassed by sending an intent to launch the MainTvActivity.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application did not properly enforce the requirement that development options be enabled for access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could launch the tracing app even when development options were disabled.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending an intent to launch the MainTvActivity.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send intents to the target device."
