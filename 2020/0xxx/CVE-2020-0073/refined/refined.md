Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0073:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to an out-of-bounds (OOB) write in the `rw_t2t_ndef.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the context of a privileged process.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted file. This suggests the vulnerability is triggered through processing data from an external source, likely related to NFC functionality given the code location in `/system/nfc/`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted file to the target device. This could potentially be achieved through network communication or by proximity through the NFC interface. The attacker does not need to be local.
