- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the firmware for Intel NUC products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The firmware does not properly validate input, leading to a potential vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the system and must be able to interact with the vulnerable firmware. The user interaction is required.
