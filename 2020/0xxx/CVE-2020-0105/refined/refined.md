Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-0105:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-0105

**Description:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the System component of Android.
*   It is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability.
*   It has a severity rating of High.

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `onKeyguardVisibilityChanged` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The core issue is that the `onKeyguardVisibilityChanged` function lacked a necessary permission check. Without this check, any application could toggle the locked state of the keymaster, once it had been unlocked for the first time. This could allow an attacker to bypass the intended access controls related to the keymaster.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a local attacker could elevate their privileges. Specifically, an attacker could manipulate the keymaster's locked state without proper authorization. This could allow access to protected resources that should be restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have an application installed on the device.
*   **Specially Crafted File or Application:** A specially crafted application is required to trigger the vulnerability, by sending the specific commands to the `onKeyguardVisibilityChanged` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have an application installed on the target device.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require root or other high-level system privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** This vulnerability affects Android versions 9 and 10.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves adding a permission check in the `onKeyguardVisibilityChanged` function, to ensure only authorized applications can modify the keymaster's locked state.
*   **AOSP Patch:** The fix is available in the AOSP commit: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/security/%2B/1642dc003964aed54724d17d840f883f0537cebd](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/security/%2B/1642dc003964aed54724d17d840f883f0537cebd)

In summary, CVE-2020-0105 is a High severity EoP vulnerability caused by a missing permission check, allowing a local attacker with a malicious application to manipulate the keymaster's locked state, granting unauthorized access to protected resources.
