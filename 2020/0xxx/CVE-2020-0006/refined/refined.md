Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0006:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to an uncleared memory leak in the `rw_i93.cc` file within the NFC (Near Field Communication) subsystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is categorized as an information disclosure issue, which suggests that sensitive information could be exposed to an attacker through the memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the leaked memory. This leaked information could be used for further attacks or to compromise the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not explicitly mentioned but since the vulnerability lies in the NFC subsystem, it is implied that the attack is likely initiated through the NFC interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the device's NFC interface in some manner. The provided data doesn't specify if this requires physical access or if remote triggering via NFC is possible. However, the CVE description indicates a "remote information disclosure" which implies a possible remote attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by the commit `2e1feaad404748c5d9d02d92bb2973d8aa9dfb96` in the AOSP repository.
- This fix prevents the memory leak by clearing the memory correctly.
- The vulnerability was rated as "High" severity.
- Affected Android versions include 8.0, 8.1, 9, and 10.

In summary, CVE-2020-0006 is a high-severity information disclosure vulnerability due to an uncleared memory leak in the NFC subsystem of Android. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially access sensitive information.
