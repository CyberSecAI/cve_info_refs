Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0109:

**CVE-2020-0109**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how the system handles certain operations, leading to an elevation of privilege. The provided commit message "GatServer: Check invalid offset" and the code change link suggest that the vulnerability is due to a missing or improper check of an offset value within the `GatServer` component.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is an improper validation of offset values. This lack of validation allows for manipulation that could lead to unintended access or operations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit would allow a local attacker to elevate their privileges. This could lead to the attacker gaining access to resources or performing actions they normally wouldn't be able to.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    * Local attacker: The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker.
    * Crafted input/transmission: The attacker needs to use a specifically crafted input (offset value) to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker must have local access to the device.
    * The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable `GatServer` component using a crafted offset value.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided information suggests that the fix involves adding a check to ensure that the offset is valid before proceeding with the related operation.
* The CVE is listed in the Android Security Bulletin for May 2020 with a severity of "High".
* The vulnerability is present in Android versions 9 and 10
