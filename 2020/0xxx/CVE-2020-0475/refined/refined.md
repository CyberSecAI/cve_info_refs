{
  "CVE-2020-0475": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper permission checks when creating and destroying InputConsumers in WindowManagerService, allowing an app with the right permissions to consume all touch events and deny them from reaching the System UI",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Missing permission checks"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create an InputConsumer that consumes all touch events, preventing them from reaching the System UI and effectively rendering the device unusable. This can be used for denial-of-service attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious application with the necessary permission (which is the new `INPUT_CONSUMER` permission) can exploit this vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an application installed on the device with the `INPUT_CONSUMER` permission to create malicious input consumers that consume touch events."
  }
