Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0124:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The provided text indicates that the ART (Android Runtime) does not load the boot image from `/data` anymore, which makes the boot complete marker useless. The vulnerability likely stems from a flaw in how the system handles or verifies the boot process and the associated markers or flags. This can be inferred from the description of the fix: "Remove boot complete marker", indicating that the marker itself or the logic around its usage was problematic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is related to the incorrect or unnecessary usage of the boot complete marker after the ART no longer loads the boot image from `/data`. This implies a potential logic error in how the system determines the boot completion status. This can potentially be used to cause an "Elevation of Privilege" as described in the bulletin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability is classified as "Elevation of Privilege (EoP)" with a "Moderate" severity. This means that successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than intended. The exact nature of this privilege escalation is not detailed in the provided text, but it could range from gaining unauthorized access to files, to executing code with higher permission levels.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is not explicitly stated in the provided text, however the vulnerability seems to occur during the boot process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need some level of control over the system during the boot process in order to exploit this. The specific capabilities depend on the vulnerability's nature but it is likely an attacker would require to be able to influence boot parameters or trigger specific conditions during boot, possibly through malicious code already present on the device.

**Additional details:**
- The provided bulletin shows the fix for this vulnerability included multiple commits to different code repos including platform/frameworks/base, platform/art, and platform/frameworks/native.
- The fix was included in the 2020-06-05 security patch level.
- The vulnerability was rated as a moderate severity EoP issue.
