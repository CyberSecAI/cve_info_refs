Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the mapping of UIDs (User IDs) to categories. The system used only 16 bits for this mapping, while isolated processes started at a UID of 90000. This allowed a bypass of intended category restrictions

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient bit size for UID mapping:** The mapping of UIDs to categories was limited to 16 bits, while isolated processes started at a much higher UID value (90000).
- **Unnecessary category assignments for isolated processes:** The initial purpose of these categories was to isolate app-private storage, but isolated processes did not have access to this storage anyway.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Category Assignment:** An app could potentially assign itself to arbitrary categories within the `app_zygote` domain, bypassing the intended isolation.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By assigning itself to higher privilege categories, an app could potentially gain unauthorized access or permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious application could leverage this flaw to elevate its privileges by manipulating its category assignments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to run code within the `app_zygote` context, which usually means having a malicious app installed on the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves removing UID-based categories from `app_zygote` and isolated processes. This change prevents the assignment of arbitrary categories, thus removing the vulnerability. The commit message states that "The upside is that this allows us to remove mIstrustedSubject from the app_zygote domain, which prevents app code running in that context from assigning itself arbitrary categories."
- This is categorized as an Information Disclosure (ID) vulnerability.
