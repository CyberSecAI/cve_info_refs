Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** A condition where an arithmetic operation results in a value exceeding the maximum value of the data type used to store the result. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This implies full control over the affected system if successfully exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Transmission:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted transmission. This likely refers to a malformed data packet sent over a network or a specific Bluetooth transmission in this case, since the code fix was in the `platform/system/bt` repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely which suggests no physical access to the device is necessary.
*   **Crafting a Malicious Transmission:** The attacker must have the ability to craft a specific transmission that triggers the integer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message "Fix potential stack overflow caused by integer overflow" from the `android.googlesource.com` content indicates that the integer overflow is used to cause a stack overflow.
*   The Android Security Bulletin for June 2020 provides a broader context for this vulnerability, categorizing it as a "Critical" severity issue within the System component.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.

In summary, CVE-2020-0117 is a critical vulnerability stemming from an integer overflow which could lead to a stack overflow and allow for remote code execution within a privileged process via a specially crafted transmission.
