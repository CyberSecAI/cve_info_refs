Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0195:

**CVE-2020-0195**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from uninitialized reads within the `intra_pred_sse` functions in `libhevc` library.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Uninitialized Reads:**  The code attempts to read from memory that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Reading from uninitialized memory can potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive data.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is located in `libhevc` which is used for HEVC video decoding. The vulnerable code paths are exercised during video processing which suggests that a specially crafted video file or stream could trigger the vulnerability

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need the ability to provide the application with a crafted HEVC video stream or file designed to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided commit message from android.googlesource.com indicates this issue was fixed to address an issue with uninitialized reads.
* The fix involves ensuring that the intermediate buffer used in the `intra_pred_mode` assembly functions is allocated correctly with the correct size and offset, resolving the memory access violation.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
