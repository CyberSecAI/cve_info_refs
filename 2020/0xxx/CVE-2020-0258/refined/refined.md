Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0258:

**CVE-2020-0258**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is related to how Android handles the killing of app zygotes, specifically with respect to untracked child processes. The fix implements the use of `killProcessGroup` to ensure all untracked children are terminated during app zygote shutdown.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper handling of process termination, leaving child processes running and potentially creating an information disclosure vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious application could potentially obtain sensitive information by keeping processes running after they should have been terminated. This could include data related to the application's state or other system information.

*  **Attack Vectors:** Local malicious application.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have a malicious application installed on the device.

* **Additional Details:**
    * The fix ensures all untracked child processes are killed when an app's zygote is terminated using `killProcessGroup()`.
    * The vulnerability affects Android 10.
