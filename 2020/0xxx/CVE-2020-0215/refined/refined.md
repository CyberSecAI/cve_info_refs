- A remote attacker can potentially gain access to additional permissions. This could mean elevated privileges on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to use a specially crafted transmission.
- The vulnerability is triggered during NFC pairing process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to perform a specially crafted NFC transmission to the targeted device.
- They need to be within NFC range of the device to initiate the pairing process and exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in AOSP versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, 10, and 11.
- The fix involves protecting Bluetooth device information during the NFC pairing process.
- The vulnerability is described as "High" severity.
- The fix includes changes to the packages/apps/Nfc component in AOSP.
