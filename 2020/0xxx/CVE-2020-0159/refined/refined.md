Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0159:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the `nfc_ncif_proc_t3t_polling_ntf` function and in `rw_mfc_writeBlock`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code reads data from memory locations beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker may be able to read sensitive data from memory that is outside of the intended buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists in the NFC (Near Field Communication) component of the Android system.
- It can be triggered during NFC polling operations with T3T (Type 3 Tag) and during write operations with mifare tags.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable NFC component. This likely requires proximity to the target device and the ability to initiate an NFC interaction involving T3T tags or mifare tags.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented with commits `bdb74421e9382d4aa3d0ebebf5ed81693ee64071` and `e10855140214abe8947ca18f53ca50095f67ffd5`
- The vulnerability is categorized as an "Information Disclosure" with "Moderate" severity according to the Pixel Update Bulletinâ€”June 2020.
