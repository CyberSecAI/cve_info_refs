Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) read operation. Specifically, it occurs during the processing of i93 tag detection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-Bounds Read: The code attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer when handling NDEF reads from i93 tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory by triggering the OOB read. While the provided information does not explicitly state this, OOB reads are often used to obtain information beyond intended boundaries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- NFC Interaction: The attacker needs to interact with the vulnerable NFC component, specifically targeting the i93 tag detection. This would likely involve presenting a crafted i93 tag to an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Proximity: The attacker needs to be within NFC communication range of the targeted device.
- Crafted NFC Tag: The attacker needs to have the capability to create a specially crafted i93 NFC tag that can trigger the out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsed by the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided data mentions that the fix for this issue was cherry-picked from another commit (d9f2637ec5b68ce1d62bdf2cc08050167ff6135c).
- The bug ID associated with this fix is 146053215.
- The vulnerability is related to the system/nfc component, which indicates it is within the Near Field Communication functionality of the Android system.
