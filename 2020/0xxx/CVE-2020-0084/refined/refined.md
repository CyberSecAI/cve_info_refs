Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from a race condition during the initialization of `ShellSubscriber` and a Null Pointer Exception (NPE).
- The `ShellSubscriber` is lazily initialized and multiple threads can try to write to the same pointer concurrently since it's not thread safe.
- Additionally, when a null `ResultReceiver` is passed in, `statsd` crashes due to an NPE.
- This NPE allows an attacker to repeatedly crash `statsd` until the race condition occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** Multiple threads attempting to initialize the `ShellSubscriber` concurrently. This is because the initialization is not properly synchronized in thread-safe code.
- **Null Pointer Exception:**  `statsd` crashes if a null `ResultReceiver` is passed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** As categorized in the provided security bulletin, a successful exploit could lead to EoP.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly crash `statsd` by sending requests with a null `ResultReceiver`, potentially disrupting device functionality and preventing it from collecting stats. The attacker could also attempt to trigger the race condition until it occurs, resulting in a crash and potentially a device reboot.
- The race condition can crash statsd causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending requests that involve `ShellSubscriber` with a null `ResultReceiver`.
- The attack can be triggered by multiple threads, as noted in the code commit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to have the capability to send shell commands to the device in order to trigger this vulnerability by sending requests with a null `ResultReceiver`.
- They would need to be able to trigger the race condition by utilizing multiple threads, or repeatedly calling the crash inducing functionality.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided code commit message gives details about the root cause and also mentions a proof of concept attack.
- The fix involves locking during initialization to avoid the race condition and checking for null parameters to avoid the NPE.
- The CVE is listed as a Moderate severity vulnerability in the Pixel Update Bulletin for March 2020.
