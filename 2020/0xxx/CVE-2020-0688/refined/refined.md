**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of a static cryptographic key across multiple installations of Exchange Server.
- Deserialization of untrusted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) with SYSTEM privileges on the affected Exchange Server.
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the Exchange Control Panel web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker requires network access to the affected Exchange Server.
