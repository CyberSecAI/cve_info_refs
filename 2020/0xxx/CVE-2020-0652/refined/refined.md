Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-0652:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Microsoft Office Graph COM object.
*   The root cause is a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory space for a stack-based buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Context of the current process:** The attacker's code runs within the context of the current user's process, potentially granting them the same level of access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction. The target must either:
    *   Visit a malicious webpage.
    *   Open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious file or webpage that triggers the vulnerability in the Graph COM object when opened or visited by a user of a vulnerable Microsoft Office installation.
*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   Microsoft released a patch to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by L4Nce.
*   CVSS score: 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) - Local attack vector with low complexity, no privileges required, but user interaction is required. The impact is high for confidentiality, integrity and availability.
