  "CVE-2020-0147": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "This vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth component of Android system. It is related to insufficient validation of the length of HCI Events which leads to an out of bounds read.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper length validation when handling HCI (Host Controller Interface) events within the Bluetooth stack. Specifically, the system fails to verify if the received HCI event meets the minimum expected length before attempting to process it, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory or cause a denial-of-service by triggering a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HCI event. This requires the attacker to be within Bluetooth range.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device and be capable of sending crafted HCI events."
