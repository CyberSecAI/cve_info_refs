{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the libhevc library when decoding dependent slices. A dependent slice copies slice header information from a previously decoded slice. When the first slice is missing and a subsequent slice to be decoded is a dependent slice, there is no valid slice header to copy from. The code does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of missing initial slice when decoding dependent slices.",
      "Lack of validation or handling of invalid slice header information."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious media file with specific slice dependencies that trigger the error during decoding."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a crafted media file to the vulnerable service. No special privileges are required."
  },
  "additional_details": "The provided content includes the code change that addresses the vulnerability, specifically by ignoring dependent slices when the first slice is missing. The original issue was tracked with the bug ID 141688974. This issue is also mentioned in the June 2020 Pixel Update Bulletin."
