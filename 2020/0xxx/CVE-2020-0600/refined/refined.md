- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper buffer restrictions in the firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Insufficient validation of buffer sizes within the firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privileges, potentially allowing an attacker to gain higher levels of control over the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker must be authenticated on the system and have local access. The complexity of exploitation is rated as high.
