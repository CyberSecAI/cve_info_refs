Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a reversible one-way hash within the Intel CSME (Converged Security and Manageability Engine).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reversible one-way hash:  The core weakness lies in the use of a hashing algorithm that is not truly one-way, meaning it can be reversed to obtain the original input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could lead to:
  - Escalation of privilege: An attacker may be able to gain higher-level access.
  - Denial of service: The system may become unavailable.
  - Information disclosure: Sensitive information might be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Local access: An attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - Privileged user: The attacker must have existing privileged access to the system.
  - The CVSS vector indicates a high level of access needed (PR:H).
  - The attack complexity is rated as high (AC:H)

**Additional Notes:**
  - The vulnerability affects Intel CSME versions before 11.8.76, 11.12.77, and 11.22.77.
  - This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities described in Intel advisory INTEL-SA-00295.
  - NetApp products like NetApp Cloud Backup and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage are affected
  - NetApp has no plans to address this vulnerability in affected products
