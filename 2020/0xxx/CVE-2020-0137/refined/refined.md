Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0137:

**CVE-2020-0137**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the `NetworkManagementService#setIPv6AddrGenMode` function. This oversight allows any application to potentially call this function through an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanism.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The core issue is the absence of a permission check within the `NetworkManagementService#setIPv6AddrGenMode` function. This means that any application, regardless of its privileges, could invoke this function.
    *   **IPC Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the exposed IPC mechanism, which allows different processes to communicate with each other.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Although the function was meant to set the IPv6 address generation mode, a bug in the IPC implementation limited the exploitable setting to 'stable privacy', preventing a more impactful change to 'EUI-64'. Because of this, the impact of exploitation remains limited.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability is classified as a moderate EoP, but the actual impact is limited due to a bug, which constrains the ability to set the mode to EUI-64.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **IPC Calls:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious application that makes an IPC call to the vulnerable `NetworkManagementService#setIPv6AddrGenMode` function.
    *   **Local Attack:** The attack would need to originate from an application installed on the device.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Malicious App Installation:** The attacker must have a malicious application installed on the Android device.
    *   **No Root Access:** The attacker does not need root or elevated privileges initially; they can leverage the missing permission check from a regular application.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided commit message states that the function was unused, with the network stack directly using the `netd` IPC call.
* The original security bulletin classifies this vulnerability as an elevation of privilege (EoP), and moderate in severity.
