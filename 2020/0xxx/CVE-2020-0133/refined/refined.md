{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the multi-ADV SetData function when searching for the TX_Power data section.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service by writing outside of the intended buffer boundaries.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the multi-ADV SetData function, which is likely part of the Bluetooth stack or related component.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted input to the SetData function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the Bluetooth functionality of the device and provide a malicious data structure that would trigger the out-of-bounds write."
