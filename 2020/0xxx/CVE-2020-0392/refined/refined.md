  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2020-0392",
      "description": "The provided content indicates a fix for an issue where the function `Layer::getLayerDebugInfo` could be accessed from a binder thread, leading to incorrect state mixing. It now only retrieves the drawing state. The patch also addresses a zero width and height error in `m4v_h263`. ",
      "root_cause": "The root cause involves a race condition where the drawing state was being accessed from the binder thread, leading to incorrect state mixing. Additionally, a separate issue was identified where `m4v_h263` was not handling zero width or height inputs appropriately.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect state management when accessing drawing state from different threads",
        "Lack of validation for zero width and height inputs in `m4v_h263`"
      ],
      "impact": "Incorrect state mixing could lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes. Not handling zero width/height could cause unexpected behavior.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing the drawing state from a binder thread",
        "Providing zero width or height during the media processing operation"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to execute code on the device that interacts with the affected `Layer::getLayerDebugInfo` or  `m4v_h263` functionality."
