Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-0728:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `TrustedInstaller` service, which runs as `NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, hosts a COM service called "Sxs Store Class" with the interface `ISxsStore`. This interface is intended for installing/uninstalling assemblies via application manifest files into the WinSxS store and should be restricted to administrators.
*   Due to improper implementation of authorization logic, the `ISxsStore` interface was accessible to any user on the local system. Specifically, the authorization logic within `CSxsStore::BeginAssemblyInstall`  incorrectly identifies all connections originating from `TrustedInstaller.exe` as `NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, regardless of the actual caller.
*   The vulnerability arises because the service uses the `CoImpersonateClient` and `CheckTokenMembership` to check for administrator privileges, but since the `TrustedInstaller` is calling the COM object for the user, it sees `NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` for the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The core vulnerability is that the `ISxsStore` interface's access control is flawed. The interface meant to be available only to administrators, was unintentionally exposed to any local user.
*   **Abuse of Junction Points:** Although the intended destination for installed assemblies (`C:\Windows\WinSXS`) is protected, the vulnerability can be exploited by referencing files outside this directory by leveraging junction points in the manifest's source file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An unprivileged user can force the `TrustedInstaller` service to make a copy of any file on the local filesystem, within the context of `NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This bypasses file system access control lists (ACLs) and can be used to disclose sensitive files.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While the `ISxsStore` interface seems limited to basic installers, the underlying wcp framework is complex and features advanced installers. There is a potential for further exploitation using these advanced installers for privilege escalation, though this was not fully demonstrated within the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **COM Interface Abuse:** The attacker uses the exposed `ISxsStore` COM interface by providing a malicious manifest file.
*   **Junction Point Manipulation:** The attacker uses junction points to redirect the file copying operation to a target file outside of the intended `WinSXS` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker requires only a regular user account on the target system; no administrative privileges are initially required.
*   **Ability to Create Junction Points:** The attacker needs the capability to create directory junction points.
*   **Ability to Interact with COM:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with COM objects on the system to call the vulnerable `ISxsStore` interface.
