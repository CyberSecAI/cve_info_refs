  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The MIDI extractor can get stuck in an infinite (or very long) loop when processing certain files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The media extractor service is vulnerable to files that take a very long time to process, which can lead to a denial of service.",
      "The vulnerability is in third-party code which is hard to harden."
    ],
    "impact": "The affected process will crash if the MIDI extraction times out.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted MIDI file to be processed by the media extractor service."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to provide a malformed MIDI file to the media extractor service. This could be done through a malicious app or by somehow having the device process a malicious file."
