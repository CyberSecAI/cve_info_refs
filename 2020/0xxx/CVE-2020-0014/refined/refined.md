  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Toast class enforcement was only on the client side, allowing an app to use reflection or other means to make the Toast clickable. This allowed for tapjacking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of server-side enforcement",
      "Reliance on client-side checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Tapjacking, which allows interception of touch events to perform actions such as stealing PINs and passwords.",
    "attack_vectors": "An app uses reflection to remove the FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE flag from a Toast object, making the Toast clickable",
    "required_capabilities": "Malicious app that can use reflection to modify the Toast object."
  },
  "resolution": "The fix enforces the FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE flag at the system level."
