Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0055:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper permission and app identity checks during tethering functionality in the Android Bluetooth component. The vulnerability is an Information Disclosure issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient validation of the caller's package name, UID and requested permissions when initiating tethering.
- Specifically, a caller could bypass checks intended to ensure they possess the correct permissions and identity for tethering.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access to tethering functions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an unspecified interaction with the Android Bluetooth tethering component.
- The specific mechanism is not detailed in the provided commit log but the context suggests it involves a caller app making a tethering request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable Bluetooth tethering functionality. It is likely that this requires a malicious app to be installed on the device.

**Additional Details**
- The fix involves checking that the caller passes it's package name, and then confirming that the UID belongs to that package, and that the UID has required permissions.
- WRITE_SETTINGS permission has been added to the bluetooth process.
