Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of hosts when matching intent filters. Specifically, the code was not ensuring that all potential hosts (including those that match non-web schemes, like http or https) were included in the autoVerify evaluation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of comprehensive host validation in the `IntentFilter` matching process. The system was not considering all possible hosts during the auto verification process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A malicious application could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain access to permissions or capabilities that it wouldn't normally have. This could be achieved by crafting a specific intent that bypasses security checks.
- **Bypass of user interaction requirements:** This vulnerability could be leveraged by a malicious app to bypass user interaction requirements, thereby potentially gaining elevated access or permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the device.
- **Crafted Intents:** The malicious app needs to send a specifically crafted intent to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install an application on the device.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of the Android intent system and how intent filters are used for auto-verification of apps.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity EoP.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, and 10
- The fix ensures that all possible hosts, including those that match non-web schemes, are considered in the autoVerify evaluation.
- The fix for this issue has been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
