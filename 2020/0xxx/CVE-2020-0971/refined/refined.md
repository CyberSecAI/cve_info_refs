Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft SharePoint Server handles web parts, specifically those of type `DataFormWebPart`. By crafting a custom `DataFormWebPart`, an attacker can force the server to process arbitrary server-side includes (SSI).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the improper handling of user-supplied data within the `DataFormWebPart` functionality, allowing for Server-Side Include (SSI) injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information, including stored credentials. This could lead to further compromise of the SharePoint server and potentially other systems that rely on those credentials.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based and can be performed remotely. The attacker needs to be authenticated to the SharePoint server. The attack vector is through crafting a malicious `DataFormWebPart`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires a valid user account with the ability to interact with and create `DataFormWebPart` in SharePoint.

In summary, the vulnerability is a server-side include injection issue in SharePoint that allows authenticated users to potentially access stored credentials.
