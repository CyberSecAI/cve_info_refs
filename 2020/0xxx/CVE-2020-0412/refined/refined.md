Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0412:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `EuiccController#getEid` function. It does not properly validate the calling package name. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the calling UID is owned by the calling package. This allows an attacker to pass the package name of another app that has carrier privileges, and effectively gain those privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `EuiccController#getEid` function lacks proper validation of the calling package name, allowing a malicious app to impersonate another app.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By providing the package name of a privileged carrier app, the attacker can gain access to carrier privileges they shouldn't have.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain carrier privileges, leading to unauthorized access to subscription data or other sensitive information.
- An app can effectively gain carrier privileges by passing the package name of another app that has carrier privileges to one or more subscriptions.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious application can call the `EuiccController#getEid` function while providing the package name of a privileged carrier app.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- The attacker needs to know the package name of an application with carrier privileges.
