{
  "CVE-2020-0419": {
    "Root cause": "The referrerUri field was being set on SessionInfo even when the caller was not the owner of the session.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of referrer information",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "An application that isn't the owner of a session could gain access to the referrer URI associated with that session.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious application could potentially call a method or API that provides access to SessionInfo, leading to unauthorized information disclosure of the referrer URI.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A local attacker with a malicious application installed on the device.",
    "More Details": "The provided fix ensures that the referrerUri field is left null when the caller is not the owner of the session."
