Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Android handles app-ops notifications. Specifically, when an app starts an app-op (an operation requiring user permissions), and that app-op is both "active" and "noted", a notification is sent to callbacks indicating the end of the use after a certain delay (usually 5 seconds). However, the app-op might still be active. This premature notification can cause indicators, such as microphone-use indicators, to be removed from notifications prematurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Premature notification of the end of an app-op use.
- Failure to check if an app-op is still actively in use before sending the end-of-use notification.
- Incorrect handling of app-op states which leads to premature removal of notification indicators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the premature removal of indicators from notifications. This can mislead users about which app is currently using a specific permission, such as the microphone.
- Although not explicitly stated, this behavior could mask malicious app activity from the user, which could be a secondary impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious app could start an app-op, causing an indicator to appear in the notification area.
- The system incorrectly sends an end-of-use notification based on timeout, removing the indicator while the app-op is still in use.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the capability to start an app-op, which would generally require the malicious app to hold the relevant permission and initiate the activity associated with it.
- The attacker needs to be in a position where the app-op is used, noted, and then the timeout is reached, so that the incorrect notification is sent.
- The attacker needs the app to still be active after the notification is sent.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code change prevents the issue by checking if the app-op is still in use (either active or noted) before notifying listeners of the end of use.
- The commit message states: "Prevent sending early termination of appop use. If a package starts a particular appop both as active and noted, once one of them is finished (usually noted after 5s), a message will be sent to callbacks indicating the end of the use. However, the app op may still be active. This could result in the removal of indicators prematurely from notifications."
- The fix was tested by observing that a notification does not lose the microphone indicator.
- The vulnerability is classified as an "Elevation of Privilege (EoP)", which indicates that a local attacker (a malicious app) can gain elevated privileges by taking advantage of the vulnerability.
