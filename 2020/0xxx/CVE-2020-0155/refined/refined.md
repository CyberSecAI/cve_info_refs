Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to an out-of-bounds write in the `phNxpNciHal_send_ese_hal_cmd` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The code is writing data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially corrupting memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of privilege: An attacker could potentially elevate their privileges by exploiting the out-of-bounds write.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `phNxpNciHal_send_ese_hal_cmd` function within the NXP NFC HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). An attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability through interactions with the NFC functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the NFC functionality to trigger the vulnerable function call. This could involve proximity to the device with a malicious NFC payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit messages mention the fix prevents out-of-bounds write in the `phNxpNciHal_send_ese_hal_cmd` and `phNxpNciHal_write_ex` functions.
- The provided content suggests this vulnerability exists in the NXP NFC HAL.

This analysis is based on the limited information available from the commit messages. A complete understanding would require reviewing the actual code changes.
