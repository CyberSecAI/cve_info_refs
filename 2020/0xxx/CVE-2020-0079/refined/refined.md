Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `releaseSecureStops()` function.
- An out-of-bounds read occurs if the input `SecureStopRelease` size is smaller than the size of `uint32_t`.
- There's a second heap buffer overflow vulnerability in `clearKey CryptoPlugin::decrypt` because `destPtr` was not pointing to the raw destination pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow
- Out-of-bounds read

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, due to the heap buffer overflow. This falls under the category of "Elevation of Privilege" (EoP).
- Information disclosure can be a consequence of out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a specially crafted input to the `releaseSecureStops()` function that causes an out-of-bounds read.
- Another attack vector involves the `clearKey CryptoPlugin::decrypt` function where destPtr is not pointing to the raw destination.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide specific input to the affected functions.
- The attacker likely requires some level of local access/privilege to trigger the vulnerability, as this is an "Elevation of Privilege" issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information comes from git commits, showing the fixes for this issue.
- This vulnerability was found in the Android media framework.
- The vulnerability was found in the `frameworks/av` component.
- The fixes were included in AOSP versions 9 and 10.
- The vulnerability is related to bugs 144766455 and 144506242.
