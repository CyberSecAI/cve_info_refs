Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The provided commit message "Remove hidden shared account methods from AccountManager.java" alongside with the CVE description suggests that the root cause of CVE-2020-0209 lies in the way the Android Account Manager was handling hidden shared account methods. This likely relates to an API design issue in the Android framework that allowed for unintended access to account-related information or functionality. The commit removes the hidden shared methods, which fixes the vulnerability by restricting access to only those methods designed to be exposed and used by apps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The CVE entry explicitly states "EoP" which means a vulnerability exists allowing a malicious app to gain higher privileges than it should normally have.
- **Insecure API Design:** The presence of "hidden shared account methods" in `AccountManager.java` indicates a design flaw that allows access to internal methods that should be restricted. This is a form of insecure design that can be exploited for malicious purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit would allow a malicious application to elevate its privileges, potentially gaining access to sensitive account data, impersonating accounts, or performing actions it should not have permission to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** A malicious app could be crafted to call these hidden methods to perform actions that it is not authorized to perform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Installed Malicious Application:** The attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the affected device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit log specifically mentions that the fix removes the hidden shared account methods from `AccountManager.java`. This confirms that the vulnerability was indeed caused by the presence of these hidden APIs, which were not supposed to be accessed.
- The fix also involved adding tests ("Test: CTS"). This indicates that the fix was followed by tests to verify the fix and prevent future regressions.

In summary, CVE-2020-0209 is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability due to the presence of hidden, shared account methods within the AccountManager API. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. The fix involves removing these methods to prevent malicious applications from using them.
