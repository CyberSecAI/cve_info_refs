Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-0480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied URIs within the `DocumentsProvider` component in Android. Specifically, the code did not validate the authorities of URIs used in calls to the provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of user-supplied URIs, particularly those provided via `DocumentsContract.EXTRA_URI`, `DocumentsContract.EXTRA_TARGET_URI`, and `DocumentsContract.EXTRA_PARENT_URI`.
*   **Missing Authority Check:** The code failed to verify the authority component of the URIs before using them. This allowed malicious applications to potentially supply crafted URIs with malicious authorities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** By supplying maliciously crafted URIs, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges. The exact impact depends on the actions performed by the `DocumentsProvider` using these URIs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a URI with a malicious authority and passing it to the `DocumentsProvider` through the above-mentioned `DocumentsContract` extras.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Install and Execute an App:** An attacker would need the ability to install a malicious application on the target device and have it execute.
*   **Target Android Version:** The vulnerability is specifically marked as impacting Android 11.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided commit messages highlight that the fix involves validating these extra URIs, not just `DocumentsContract.EXTRA_URI`, which was already being validated. This prevents malicious apps from exploiting the missing validation for other URIs such as `DocumentsContract.EXTRA_TARGET_URI` and `DocumentsContract.EXTRA_PARENT_URI`.
