{
  "CVE-2020-0113": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the assumption that a remote binder is local. Specifically, the 'owner' was being set to random bits inside a BpBinder object.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect assumption about binder object location (local vs remote)",
       "Improper handling of binder object ownership"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "This can lead to crashes due to incorrect ownership of BpBinder objects.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a remote binder is used where a local binder was expected.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to influence the creation or usage of binder objects such that a remote binder ends up where a local one is assumed"
  },
 "CVE-2020-0113": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The metadata object's memory might be re-allocated, leading to issues when sensor timestamps are accessed after a metadata change.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free due to metadata re-allocation.",
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potential crashes or undefined behavior when accessing sensor timestamps after metadata re-allocation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when methods that modify metadata are called after a sensor timestamp has been captured.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the sequence of operations where the metadata object is re-allocated after timestamp capture, but before it's used."
