Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from an implicit length overflow during the creation process of `FileMap` objects. Specifically, the `FileMap::create` method, when encountering an overflow during size calculations, did not explicitly fail, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The primary weakness is an integer overflow vulnerability. When calculating the size of a memory mapping, a sufficiently large requested size can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect mapping size. This can result in an out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Implicit Failure:** The original code implicitly failed by aborting when an overflow was detected during the `FileMap::create` operation, instead of explicitly handling the overflow and returning an error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local malicious application could bypass user interaction requirements to gain access to additional permissions by exploiting the overflow. The vulnerability allows for a local privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Malicious Application:** The attack vector involves a malicious application installed on the device. This application needs to have local access to the system to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
- The attacker's application must be able to call the vulnerable function with a crafted size that triggers an integer overflow during memory map creation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided AOSP commit message indicates that the fix explicitly checks for overflow conditions and fails the call if detected.
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, and 10.
- The fix involves a change to `system/core` component.
