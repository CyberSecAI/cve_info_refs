{
  "CVE-2020-0416": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The toggle widget click events were being handled by SwitchPreference instead of the toggle widget itself when the view was overlapped.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Incorrect event handling leading to unintended behavior when a toggle widget is overlapped by another view.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially manipulate the toggle state of a special app access setting by clicking on an overlapped view, bypassing the intended user interaction.",
    "Attack vectors": "Overlapping a view on top of the toggle widget in Settings -> Apps & notifications -> Advanced -> Special app access.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create an app that overlaps the toggle widgets in the special app access settings and be able to trick the user into clicking the overlapped area."
