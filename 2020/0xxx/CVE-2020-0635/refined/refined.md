Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-0635

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) service.
- It involves the creation of a junction, which is then exploited to overwrite the contents of a chosen file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The core issue is the ability of a low-privileged user to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- **File Overwrite:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by abusing the WIA service's handling of junctions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability results in the attacker gaining SYSTEM-level privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must first obtain the capability to run code with low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system with low-level privileges.
- The attacker must be able to create a file system junction.

**Additional Details:**
- Microsoft released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2020-01-10, and the advisory was released on 2020-01-17.
