Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0413:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the system handles GATT read type responses, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the system attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer, which can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or potentially other security issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is not fully detailed in the provided snippets. However, the vulnerability is flagged as "High" severity in the Android Security Bulletin. An out-of-bounds read, especially when triggered via a crafted Bluetooth response, could potentially expose sensitive information or be a stepping stone to more severe exploits.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) read response over Bluetooth.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of a vulnerable device.
- The attacker must be capable of crafting and sending malicious GATT read responses.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit message "Fix possible OOB when receive gatt read type response data" directly points to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- The commit logs also mention the related bug number 158778659.
- The Android Security Bulletin also refers to the commit: [A-158778659](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/26a348a610ec277384c98f42acd841ae647d2131), confirming the link between the commit and the CVE.
- The fix was included in the 2020-10-01 security patch level for Android.
