Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Tracing functionality used by the Routing and Remote Access service in Microsoft Windows.
*   The core issue is the lack of proper permissions on registry keys that control this tracing functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The registry keys governing the tracing functionality are not adequately protected, allowing unauthorized modification.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can manipulate these registry keys to escalate their privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges.
*   **Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **Registry Manipulation:** The attacker leverages the lack of proper permissions to modify the relevant registry keys associated with tracing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the target machine.
*   **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to run code with low privileges.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-0668 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows stemming from improperly protected registry keys related to the Tracing functionality of the Routing and Remote Access service. An attacker with low-privilege access can manipulate these registry keys to gain SYSTEM level privileges and execute arbitrary code.
