- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper configuration in the block design of Intel MAX 10 FPGA.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability arises from an incorrect configuration that allows for potential privilege escalation and information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain elevated privileges and access sensitive information, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires physical access to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with physical access to the Intel MAX 10 FPGA. The attacker does not require any specific UI interaction.
