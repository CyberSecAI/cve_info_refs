Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the Toast class enforcement was only on the client-side. This allowed applications to use reflection (or other means) to make the Toast clickable, which is a security issue because it allows tapjacking.

In the case of Certificate Installation, an app could float a window on top of the certificate installation dialog, obscuring it. This could trick a user into installing a malicious certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of System-Level Enforcement:** The enforcement of the non-clickable nature of toasts was not applied at the system level, making it vulnerable to bypass by applications using reflection.
*   **Tapjacking:** The ability to make Toasts clickable allows an attacker to intercept touch events intended for the underlying UI elements.
*   **Overlay Attack:**  An app can draw a window over the Certificate Installation dialog to hide or obscure the original UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Tapjacking:** An attacker could use a clickable toast to intercept touch events intended for other parts of the screen. This could lead to users inadvertently granting permissions, installing malicious apps, or performing other unwanted actions.
*   **Certificate Installation Manipulation:**  Attackers could trick users into installing malicious CA certificates. This could allow the attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or otherwise compromise user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability if a user were to install it.
*   **Reflection:** The vulnerability was exploited through reflection. An app can use reflection to remove the FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE flag from a Toast, making it clickable.
* **Overlay**: An attacker could float a window on top of the certificate installation dialog.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to install a malicious application:** The attacker needs to convince the user to install a malicious application.
*   **Basic Android knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with reflection in Android.

**Mitigation:**

The fix brings the enforcement to the system by applying the `FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE` flag. This prevents apps from making Toasts clickable and intercepting touch events.
The fix adds the `HIDE_NON_SYSTEM_OVERLAY_WINDOWS` flag during activity creation. This prevents other activities from drawing over the certificate dialog.
