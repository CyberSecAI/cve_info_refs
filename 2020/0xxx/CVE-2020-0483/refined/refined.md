Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0483:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a double free in the `libdrmframeworkcommon` library when the shared libraries are closed. The library was being statically linked to multiple libraries that were used by libfwddlockengine. When these shared libraries close, the same block of static memory is freed twice.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Elevation of privilege.
- The document indicates this vulnerability as moderate severity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The specific method to trigger the double free is not detailed. However, it involves the closing of shared libraries that statically link `libdrmframeworkcommon`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger the specific conditions leading to the closing of the shared libraries.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided commit messages explain the root cause of the issue.
- The fix involves using a shared version of the `libdrmframeworkcommon` library instead of static linking it to multiple libraries to avoid the double free.
