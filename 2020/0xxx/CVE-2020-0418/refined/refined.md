Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue within the Package Installer component of the Android framework. The specific flaw is related to how the Package Installer handles permission group definitions. The commit message "DO NOT MERGE Use permission group definition if defined in PermissionController" suggests that the Package Installer was incorrectly using a permission group definition that should have been defined within the PermissionController.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permission Group Definition Handling:** The core vulnerability lies in the Package Installer not properly referencing the permission group definition as intended. It seems like it might have been using a default definition or incorrectly defined one, instead of relying on PermissionController to provide it.
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The CVE description and the associated Android Security Bulletin indicate that this vulnerability leads to EoP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass User Interaction:** A local malicious app could leverage this flaw to bypass user interaction requirements, which are normally needed to acquire elevated privileges or permissions.
- **Access to Additional Permissions:** Successful exploitation could lead to the malicious application gaining access to additional permissions that it should not normally have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
- **Bypass Mechanisms:** The attacker would need to craft the malicious application in a way that triggers the vulnerability during the installation or permission-granting process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to install an application:** The attacker needs to be able to install their malicious application onto the device.
- **Local access:** The attacker does not need to be remote, this is a local vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is listed with a "High" severity rating.
- It affects Android 10 devices according to the provided Android Security Bulletin.
- The fix involves ensuring the Package Installer uses the permission group definition as provided by PermissionController rather than relying on possibly incorrect definitions.
- The commit ID `5148967312f4d59c456160463bbf120cf58abba2` on android.googlesource.com links to the specific code change that addresses this.
