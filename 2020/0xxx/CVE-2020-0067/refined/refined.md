USN-4527-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities
   - It was discovered that the F2FS file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking on xattrs in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2020-0067](security/CVE-2020-0067))

Android code change:
    - f2fs: fix to avoid memory leakage in f2fs_listxattr
    - In f2fs_listxattr, there is no boundary check before memcpy e_name to buffer. If the e_name_len is corrupted, unexpected memory contents may be returned to the buffer.

```

- **Root cause:** The F2FS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel has a missing bounds check in `f2fs_listxattr` before copying extended attribute names (`e_name`) to a buffer. If `e_name_len` is corrupted, out-of-bounds memory can be read.
- **Weaknesses:** Missing bounds check in F2FS file system when handling extended attributes (xattrs) which leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact:** A local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read kernel memory, which could expose sensitive information.
- **Attack Vectors:** A local attacker could exploit the vulnerability by triggering the vulnerable code path in the F2FS filesystem and providing corrupted `e_name_len` data, causing an out-of-bounds read.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system to trigger the vulnerable code path.
