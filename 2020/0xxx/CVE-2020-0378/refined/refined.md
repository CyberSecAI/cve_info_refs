Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-0378:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-0378

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Wi-Fi component of the Android system. Specifically, it is triggered when handling GATT read type responses.
- The vulnerability is related to how Passpoint (Wi-Fi Hotspot 2.0) broadcasts are handled. It seems that certain R2 broadcasts within Passpoint were leaking the Passpoint AP BSSID without location permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure (ID): The core vulnerability is that the BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier), which can be used to identify a Wi-Fi access point, was being broadcast without appropriate location permission checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gather information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, including those using Passpoint. This could expose the location of users who are connected to these networks by obtaining their device's location through BSSID information.
- The leak exposes the Passpoint AP BSSID without location permissions, leading to privacy implications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** An attacker who is within range of the vulnerable Wi-Fi broadcast can intercept the broadcast data.
- **Wireless Network:**  The attacker needs to be in proximity to a Wi-Fi network broadcasting the vulnerable Passpoint information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of a vulnerable device to intercept the broadcasts.
- The attacker does not require additional permissions to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for the vulnerability involves removing the R2 broadcasts for ICon, Deauth Imminent, and Subscription Remediation. These broadcasts were deemed not necessary and were causing the leak of the BSSID.
- The bug was fixed by removing the unnecessary R2 broadcasts.
- The fix is present in AOSP versions 9, 10, and 11.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
