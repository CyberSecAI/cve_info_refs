Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0415:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is related to how PendingIntents are handled within the Android framework. Specifically, the issue arises because implicit PendingIntents were not being marked as immutable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper handling of PendingIntents:** The core weakness lies in the fact that implicit PendingIntents were not being treated as immutable. This could lead to an attacker modifying or injecting malicious data into the intent.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious application to bypass permission checks, potentially gaining access to permissions that it should not have.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of privilege (EoP):** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to bypass permission requirements, gaining access to sensitive user data or system resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local malicious application:** A malicious app installed on the device can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
*   The malicious application does not require any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional details:**

* The fix involves marking implicit PendingIntents as immutable
*  The fix was cherry-picked from commits `84e08280d3882cfe4bad12ab426016c6d0efc7fb` and `02bdeeffb3135de0f3e18c3a85e6730b021fd191` and is tracked in AOSP bug ID A-156020795.
