  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to unsafe chaining of calls to `c_str()` on a temporary std::string object returned by `BtAddrString()`. The returned `std::string` object is a temporary, and chaining `c_str()` results in a dangling pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of dangling pointers",
      "Unsafe chaining of method calls on a temporary object"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure due to a dangling pointer.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is within the Bluetooth subsystem, suggesting an attack vector involving Bluetooth communication.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would likely need to be within Bluetooth range and able to trigger the vulnerable code path."
