Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-0194

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow while parsing `num_long_term_pics`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow. This occurs during the parsing of the `num_long_term_pics` field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is due to the integer overflow allowing memory corruption which can lead to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation can occur through processing a specially crafted media file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a specially crafted media file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `libhevc` library.
- A fix was implemented by correcting an integer overflow.
- There is a proof-of-concept (PoC) available demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The fix involves avoiding an unnecessary pointer increment to prevent the integer overflow.
