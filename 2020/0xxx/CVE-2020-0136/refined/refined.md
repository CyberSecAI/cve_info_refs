Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0136:

**CVE Description:**
The provided CVE description is a placeholder.

**Analysis:**
The provided content includes the June 2020 Pixel Update Bulletin and related code commits. CVE-2020-0136 is present in the bulletin.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in a missing or inadequate overflow check within the `libhwbinder` component. Specifically, it involves unsigned arithmetic operations where an addition or multiplication can wrap around, leading to incorrect results. The fix involves explicitly checking if `a + b < a`  or `a > c / b` to detect wraparounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow: The vulnerability occurs because unsigned integer arithmetic operations are performed without proper checks for potential overflows. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially compromise security.
- Missing overflow checks: The code lacked necessary checks before performing potentially overflowing operations, thus creating the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. This could enable an attacker to gain access to sensitive data or to control the targeted system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `libhwbinder` component, specifically related to its handling of arithmetic operations.
- An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing crafted input data that triggers an overflow in the unsigned integer operations during inter-process communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable `libhwbinder` component, likely through interprocess communication.
- The attacker would also need to craft an input that triggers the overflow condition.
- No special access is mentioned for this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding explicit overflow checks, specifically using `(a + b < a)` for additions and `(a > c / b)` for multiplications. This fix ensures that potential integer overflows during unsigned arithmetic operations are detected and handled gracefully, preventing any unwanted consequences.
- The issue is described as a "security issue for using mock location without permission". This suggests the `libhwbinder` may be used to check location permission.
- The fix also addresses a related issue of removing mock location apps when developer options are disabled.

In summary, CVE-2020-0136 is caused by a missing overflow check in `libhwbinder` when handling arithmetic operations. Successful exploitation could lead to elevation of privilege by an attacker with the ability to interact with the vulnerable process, which can trigger an overflow via crafted input data during inter-process communication.
