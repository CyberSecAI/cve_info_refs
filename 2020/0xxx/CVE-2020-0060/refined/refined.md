Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0060:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks within the TelephonyProvider when handling SELECT statements. Specifically, applications with a restricted view of SMS databases can potentially bypass these restrictions by using subqueries. This allows them to access data that they would not normally be authorized to view.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability enables unauthorized information disclosure of SMS data.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:** It bypasses the intended restricted view mechanism of the SMS database.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Improper handling of SELECT statements and subqueries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:**  An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive SMS data that should have been protected.
- **Privacy Violation:**  Private user data can be exposed without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation, this vulnerability enables an app with restricted privileges to access data outside of its authorized scope.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** A malicious application, installed on the Android device, could exploit this vulnerability.
- **SQL Injection:** Although not explicitly stated as SQL injection, the vulnerability involves the manipulation of SQL queries to access unauthorized data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have an application installed on the target device.
- **Restricted SMS View:** The attacking application needs to have only a restricted view of the SMS database, since that restriction is what is being bypassed.

**Additional notes:**

- The fix for this issue involves adding code to check for SELECT statements in queries. This prevents apps with a restricted view of the SMS databases from using subqueries to access the unrestricted view.

The provided commit message from android.googlesource.com provides additional information regarding the fix and the context of the vulnerability, namely:
- "Add code to check for SELECT statements in query"
- "Add code that prevents apps with only a restricted view of the SMS databases from using subqueries in their queries to the SMS provider, which may potentially leak data from the unrestricted view."
- The vulnerability was identified with the ID 143229845.
