Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-0036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `PermissionMonitor` component. Specifically, two issues were identified:

1.  `PermissionMonitor#hasPermission` only checks if an app requested a permission but doesn't verify if the permission can actually be granted to the app. This leads to incorrect information being passed to the network, allowing apps to use restricted networks without having the necessary privileges.
2.  `PermissionMonitor#hasUseBackgroundNetworksPermission` only uses the first package name of the UID to check for permissions, which is incorrect as each package can declare different permissions. This leads to apps being incorrectly identified as having network permissions they might not possess.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The `PermissionMonitor` fails to accurately verify if an app can use certain permissions, specifically related to network access.
*   **Inconsistent UID-based Permissions:** The `PermissionMonitor` doesn't properly handle permissions for multiple packages associated with the same UID, which could potentially grant one app permissions intended for another.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local malicious app can bypass user interaction requirements and gain access to additional permissions. In particular, an app could gain access to restricted network capabilities without being granted the necessary privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** An attacker needs to install a malicious application on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to install an application on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message states that the vulnerability was addressed by correcting the permission checks in `PermissionMonitor`, using the correct method for checking permissions for each package associated with the same UID.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
*   The issue affects Android versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, and 10.
