| Intel ID: | INTEL-SA-00336 |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory Category: | Software |

### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) SDK may allow escalation of privilege.Intel is releasing software updates to mitigate this potential vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2020-0561](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0561)

Description: Improper initialization in the Intel(R) SGX SDK may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 2.5 Low

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

### Affected Products:

Intel® SGX SDK before v2.6.100.1 for Windows\*, and

Intel® SGX SDK before v2.8.100.1 for Linux

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends updating the Intel® SGX SDK for Windows\* to v2.6.100.1 or later.

Intel recommends updating the Intel® SGX SDK for Linux to v2.8.100.1 or later.

Updates are available for download at these locations:

Intel® SGX SDK for Windows\*:

<https://registrationcenter.intel.com/en/forms/?productid=2614>

Intel® SGX SDK for Linux:

<https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads>

For those SGX application enclaves which use floating point, solution developers should recompile their affected enclaves with the updated Intel SGX SDK, and re-issue the application. Affected solution developers should also consider increasing the Security Version Numbers (ISVSVN) of their updated SGX application enclaves.

Developers implementing their own SDK should review the documentation and code changes issued with the Intel SGX SDK for Linux.

### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Jo Van Bulck (imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven) Fritz Alder (imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven) Frank Piessens (imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven) David Oswald (The University of Birmingham, UK) Flavio Garcia (The University of Birmingham, UK) Eduard Marin (The University of Birmingham, UK) and Abdulla Aldoseri (The University of Birmingham, UK) for reporting this issue.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
