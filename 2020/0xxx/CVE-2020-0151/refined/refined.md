Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0151:

**CVE-2020-0151**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the `C2BufferData::linearBlocks()` function in the Android Verified Boot (AVB) component. This function returns a `std::vector`, and chaining method calls on it leads to an immediate dereference of a dangling pointer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core issue is a dangling pointer dereference. Specifically, the `C2BufferData::linearBlocks()` function returns a vector object, and subsequent calls chained to it result in a dereference of the pointer to the vector. If the underlying data of the vector has already been invalidated/freed, this causes a read of invalid memory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for an information disclosure. The immediate dereference of a dangling pointer could lead to a read of out-of-bounds memory.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves triggering the vulnerable code path within the AVB component. This likely involves manipulating data structures or triggering conditions that cause the `C2BufferData::linearBlocks()` method to return a pointer that is subsequently accessed after the underlying memory has become invalid.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker would need to be able to execute code or trigger specific conditions to reach the vulnerable code path where the dangling pointer dereference occurs. It can be concluded from the fix description that this is a local vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided commit message from android.googlesource.com provides the technical details of the fix. It clearly states that the chaining method calls on the returned std::vector lead to a dangling pointer.
*   The commit message also provides the specific Bug ID: 142544793, which is also present in the Pixel Update Bulletin
*   The provided document explicitly states that the vulnerability has a "Moderate" severity

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-0151 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the AVB component of Android due to a dangling pointer dereference. This is triggered by improper use of a vector's underlying memory through chained method calls. This issue is fixed in the 2020-06-05 security patch level.
