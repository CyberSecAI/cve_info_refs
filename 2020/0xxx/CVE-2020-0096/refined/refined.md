Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0096:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-0096

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `startActivity` function handles tasks from different applications. It does not properly isolate tasks from different applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
- Improper task isolation when starting activities from different applications.
- The source caller can launch its activity above an activity of a different application within the same task.
- The original implementation does not separate tasks between applications resulting in all activities running in the same task.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within a privileged process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the device.
- **Specially Crafted File:** The attacker needs to craft a specific file which triggers the vulnerability when passed to the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to run code on the target device.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `frameworks/base` component of Android.
- The fix involves creating separate tasks for activities launched from different applications.
- The commit message highlights that previously, the `startActivity` calls from multiple different applications would all be in the same task. The fix creates a new task for each application.

**Patch Information:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is available in AOSP versions 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
- The AOSP commit link is provided: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/a952197bd161ac0e03abc6acb5f48e4ec2a56e9d](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/a952197bd161ac0e03abc6acb5f48e4ec2a56e9d)
