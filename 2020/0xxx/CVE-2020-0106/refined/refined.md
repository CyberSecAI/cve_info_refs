Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0106:

**CVE Description:**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2020-0106 is related to an information disclosure vulnerability in the Telephony component of Android. Specifically, it involves the `getCallLocation` function.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check for `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission on the `getCallLocation` function for apps targeting API level 28 or lower. This means that apps without the required location permissions were still able to access location data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Permission Check:**  The primary weakness is that the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission was not enforced for apps targeting older API levels when calling `getCallLocation`
- **Information Disclosure:**  This allows apps to access potentially sensitive location information without explicit permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker, through a malicious application, could access location information of a user without the user's consent, potentially leading to privacy violations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** A malicious app installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Target API Level:** The exploit works for applications targeting API level 28 or earlier.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Install an app:** An attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the targeted device.
- **Target API level <=28:** The malicious application needs to target Android API level 28 or lower.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves enforcing the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission check on the `getCallLocation` function, regardless of the application's target API level.
- The provided commit message indicates a fix for bug #147402629 and bug #148414207.
- The fix was manually tested, including a specific test case: `TelephonyManagerTest#testSdk28CellLocation`.
