{
  "CVE-2020-0103": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The commit message indicates that buffers allocated by `osi_malloc()` need to be freed using `osi_free()` because they have canary bytes around them. This suggests that a memory management issue, likely a use-after-free or double-free, could occur if these specially allocated buffers are not freed correctly.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Improper memory management leading to potential use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted transmission, likely over Bluetooth (given the context of `system/bt`).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker capable of sending specially crafted Bluetooth transmissions."
