**CVE-2020-0248**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is related to how implicit intents are handled within the Android Framework. The provided commit message indicates that implicit intents were made immutable, suggesting a potential issue where mutable intents could be exploited.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness lies in the improper handling of implicit intents, leading to a potential information disclosure. Specifically, the vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure (ID) issue, meaning sensitive data might be exposed due to the way implicit intents were processed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability. The impact is classified as "High" severity.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted implicit intent that can be triggered by a malicious application or a system component.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious application or control a system component to send the specially crafted intent. A local attacker might use a malicious app, while a remote attacker might exploit another system vulnerability to trigger the intent.

**Additional Notes**
