Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on which apps can call `ActivityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo()`. This method is expensive and should only be called by system processes, or apps with appropriate privileged permissions. The code change aims to throttle requests to `ActivityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo()` to prevent abuse by apps. Additionally, the fix prevents apps from obtaining information about other processes, unless they have the necessary privileged permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** Without proper restrictions, applications could potentially obtain sensitive information about other processes, including memory usage data, by abusing the `getProcessMemoryInfo()` API. This also allows apps to potentially obtain information about system processes.
*   **Resource exhaustion:** The `getProcessMemoryInfo()` call is expensive and can potentially be abused by apps to cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain information about the memory usage of other processes, including system processes potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially exhaust system resources by repeatedly calling this function, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could create a malicious application that repeatedly calls  `ActivityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo()` without proper throttling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to install a malicious application on the Android device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves throttling the requests to `ActivityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo()` and also adding checks for permissions before allowing an app to get information about other processes.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
*   The fix is included in the Android security patch level of 2020-03-05.
*   The provided commit links show the specific code changes made to address the issue.
