Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0135:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the `RollbackManagerService` handles permissions before dumping information. Specifically, the service was not properly checking for the `DUMP` permission before performing a dump operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check for the `DUMP` permission before a dump operation in `RollbackManagerService`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information by triggering a dump operation without having the necessary `DUMP` permission. This information could include details about rollbacks, which might expose system states or configurations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves triggering a dump operation in the `RollbackManagerService` without possessing the required `DUMP` permission.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to interact with `RollbackManagerService` and trigger a dump operation, but does not necessarily need elevated privileges beyond what is required to communicate with the service. The provided code snippets confirm the fix checks for the DUMP permission.
    
**Additional notes:**
*   The provided commit message `Check DUMP permission before dumping in RollbackManagerService` and the associated bug IDs confirm the vulnerability.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in the Android security patch level of 2020-06-05 or later for Pixel devices.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate".

**Summary**

CVE-2020-0135 is a moderate-severity information disclosure vulnerability in Android's `RollbackManagerService`. It is caused by a missing permission check on the DUMP permission, which allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive system information by triggering a dump without proper authorization. The vulnerability was addressed in the June 2020 security update for Pixel devices.
