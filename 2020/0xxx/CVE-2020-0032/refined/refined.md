  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `libavc` library, specifically during the process of adding decoded buffer data to the display queue.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "An integer overflow can occur during the calculation of the minimum POC value (Picture Order Count) while adding the decoded buffer to the display queue.",
       "The buffer with an invalid POC value (specifically set to 0x7FFFFFFF) is allowed to be added to the display queue."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file. Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is through a specially crafted media file. "
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted media file to the affected device."
