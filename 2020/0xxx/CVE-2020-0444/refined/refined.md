{
  "CVE-2020-0444": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an error handling issue in the `audit_data_to_entry()` function. When a specific error occurs, the code attempts to clean up an `audit_field` struct. This cleanup process involves freeing a stored LSM string (`lsm_str`). However, the `lsm_str` field might not be properly set before the cleanup process, leading to a double free when the cleanup process is triggered. The code always assumes a non-NULL value in `audit_field.lsm_str` due to a transfer of value from `audit_field.val`, which are parts of the same union. However, in certain error cases where `audit_data_to_entry()` fails before setting the value, the `audit_field.lsm_str` could contain a bogus value inherited from audit_field.val, which could result in a double free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double free",
      "Improper error handling",
      "Incorrect assumption about union member value"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or possibly achieve arbitrary code execution through memory corruption.",
     "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is local and requires triggering a specific error case in the `audit_data_to_entry()` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to trigger a specific error within the audit subsystem. This would likely be a local attacker with some level of access to the system."
