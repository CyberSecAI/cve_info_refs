Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0211:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, specifically from the "Pixel Update Bulletin—June 2020" and the associated git commits, confirms that the content is related to CVE-2020-0211. The bulletin lists CVE-2020-0211 in the "Media framework" section, and the commit messages show fixes related to libgav1.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `libgav1` library, specifically related to how it handles input data. The commit message mentions "security fix for skip_input_data" suggesting an issue with how the library skips or processes certain input data leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is an **Information Disclosure (ID)** issue. The nature of the vulnerability is further elaborated by the patch description where it mentions fixing a vulnerability related to “skip_input_data.” Specifically, the issue seems to be related to how the library handles frame borders during prediction. This might mean that under certain conditions, the library might be able to access memory outside the intended boundaries or mishandle data while skipping input causing information to leak to an attacker who is controlling this input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to information disclosure. An attacker might be able to gain access to sensitive data that should not be accessible to them.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to be able to provide a specially crafted media file or stream that utilizes the vulnerable code path in libgav1. This could be achieved through various means like enticing a user to open such a media file, or through a malicious website leveraging media playback in a browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `libgav1` library, typically in the form of a malicious media file or stream.

**Additional Technical Details:**

The commit messages and code changes associated with the fix show that the issue was addressed by applying frame border during prediction. These changes modify how the `libgav1` library handles the input data when predicting the content of video frames, specifically in areas near the borders of the frame. This prevents the vulnerability by ensuring that the library will now adhere to its intended data boundaries when making these predictions.
The multiple commit messages related to `libgav1` that are tied to this CVE suggest that the vulnerability may have been complex or may have required multiple fixes.
