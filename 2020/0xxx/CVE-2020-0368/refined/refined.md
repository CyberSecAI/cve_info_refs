**CVE-2020-0368**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the `SQLiteQueryBuilder` component of Android's framework. Specifically, it appears that empty tokens were not properly handled in strict grammar enforcement.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive data. The specific type of sensitive data is not detailed in this document.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `SQLiteQueryBuilder` was not properly handling empty tokens within a strict grammar.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with privileged access can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A local attacker with privileged access to the device can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the device.
    *   Privileged access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves allowing empty tokens in `SQLiteQueryBuilder`'s strict grammar enforcement.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Android 11, with backports to other versions not mentioned here.
*   The provided commit messages and links confirm that the vulnerability lies within the `frameworks/base` and `packages/providers/ContactsProvider` components.

**Summary of the information:**

The vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure (ID). It is a high severity issue exploitable by a local attacker having privileged access. The root cause lies in the improper handling of empty tokens in `SQLiteQueryBuilder`'s strict grammar enforcement. Exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
