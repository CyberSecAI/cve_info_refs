    {
      "cve": "CVE-2020-0384",
      "description": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of mdls (Media Data List) data. Specifically, checks were added to ensure the consistency of waveCount, instCount, regionCount, and artCount during the two passes of parsing, within the Sonivox component. The root cause of the vulnerability is likely related to inconsistent data handling during the two-pass parsing process, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access or other memory corruption issues.",
      "affected_component": "Sonivox component (part of Media Framework)",
      "vulnerability_type": "Information Disclosure (ID)",
      "severity": "High",
        "impact": "An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information through memory corruption or other unintended behavior in the parsing process. ",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted media file that triggers the inconsistent data handling during the two passes of parsing.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious media file.",
