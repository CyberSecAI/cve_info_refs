Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0177:

**CVE-2020-0177**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is located in the Bluetooth component, specifically related to potential out-of-bounds (OOB) access within the `phNxpNciHal_NfcDep_cmd_ex` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is a potential out-of-bounds access. This usually means that a read/write operation is being performed outside the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially elevate their privileges (EoP).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability resides in the Bluetooth component, suggesting an attack vector involving Bluetooth communication or interaction with the Bluetooth stack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would likely need to be within Bluetooth range to initiate a connection and trigger the vulnerability, and have the ability to interact with the Bluetooth component in a way to cause the OOB access.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided code commit message also references bug numbers 139736125 and 139532977 which may be related.
*   The fix implemented prevents the potential OOB access.

**Summary of changes:**
The additional commits provided include:
*   A commit to block guest users from using Bluetooth tethering to connect/disconnect from Wifi networks. This is due to guest users not having the necessary permission to change wifi settings. This seems unrelated to the original vulnerability
*   A commit to prevent potential OOB issues in `phNxpNciHal_NfcDep_cmd_ex`, which is the same as the description given in the Pixel update bulletin.
