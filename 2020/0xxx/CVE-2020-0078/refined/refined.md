    "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `releaseSecureStops()` function within the Media Framework. This occurs when the input `SecureStopRelease` size is smaller than the size of `uint32_t`.",

      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An out-of-bounds read can occur, which could potentially lead to code execution within a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this by crafting a specific media file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the Media Framework.",
