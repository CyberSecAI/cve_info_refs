Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0491:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak vulnerability exists within the Android media framework. The specific location is in `stream_decoder.c`.
- The vulnerability arises because pending buffers are not properly released when an error occurs. Instead of releasing all pending buffers, they are only cleared, which leads to memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: Failure to release allocated memory, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated memory leaks can consume available memory, potentially leading to application crashes or system instability by exhausting the memory of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can likely be triggered by supplying crafted media content or data that causes an error during decoding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to provide crafted media data that triggers the faulty code path in the media framework.
- No specific privilege is mentioned. An application that can process media data (e.g., video or audio) might be able to trigger this vulnerability through crafted media input.

**Additional details:**
- The fix includes changes to ensure all pending buffers are released in case of an error instead of just clearing them
- The commit message includes a "Bug" reference: 156819528.
- A fuzzer test case was used to find the issue.
- The security bulletin classifies this as a Denial of Service vulnerability.
