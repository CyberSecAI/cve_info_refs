Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0482:

**Summary:** CVE-2020-0482 is an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the Android Framework. The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read error in the Incident Service. Non-privileged apps were not allowed to use always/never lock task mode, which was not implemented correctly.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read error within the IncidentService. This occurred when handling lock task mode, which was not properly implemented.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Improper handling of task mode in `IncidentService` leading to an out-of-bounds read.
    *   Incorrect implementation of the restriction preventing non-privileged apps from using always/never lock task mode.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by triggering the out-of-bounds read.
*  **Attack vectors:** A non-privileged application, due to a flaw in the task mode handling, could trigger the out-of-bounds read in `IncidentService`, thereby accessing sensitive information.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to install and run a non-privileged application on the affected Android device.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided commit messages indicate that the issue was fixed by addressing the out-of-bounds read error and by enforcing the intended restriction on non-privileged applications using lock task mode.
* The commit message also notes that the vulnerability was present since commit 2bf2832.
* The fix was cherry-picked from commits 8ff5315e989c1348e313bcb8170b77adc80b2fce and e592700068db0335c83934f191fc9efcbd8037ec.
