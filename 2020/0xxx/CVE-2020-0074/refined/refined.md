Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0074:

**Vulnerability Description:**

CVE-2020-0074 is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability found in the Android Framework.  A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to bypass user interaction requirements, allowing it to gain access to additional permissions.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Android handles the "always" web handler status. Specifically, the commit messages suggest a problem with how the system was tracking the "always" web handler status when apps were updated or re-installed, and when the app used auto-verification functionality. The fix seems to involve ensuring that auto-verification only occurs for new hosts, and that the verification history is revoked when an app stops using auto-verify functionality, preventing persistence of the "always" status without explicit user interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bypass of User Interaction:** A malicious app could potentially bypass the intended user interaction requirements for granting permissions.
*   **Incorrect State Handling:** The system's tracking of "always" web handler status was flawed, leading to unintended persistence and potential abuse.
*   **Insufficient Verification:**  The vulnerability appears to relate to the app link verification process, specifically when an app is reinstalled or updated, or uses auto-verification features

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A malicious application can gain permissions it should not have access to, potentially leading to further malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, unauthorized access to device resources, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious app installed on the user's device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Application Installation:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.

**Additional Notes from the provided material:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in AOSP versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, and 10
*   The fix involved changes to `frameworks/base` to address the core issue.
*   The fix is associated with AOSP changes `010524415762c8d2d1e14d2a22e21fcdc6725f65` and `8640d0c78e8c1375d92b0aad1616a5ea4839fec7`.
*   The commit message indicates that a previous fix inadvertently broke link handling for well-behaved apps and indicates a need to only auto-verify at install time for new hosts
