{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper length checks for HCI (Host Controller Interface) events received over Bluetooth.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially trigger an out-of-bounds read by sending a specially crafted HCI event. This could lead to information disclosure or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious HCI event over Bluetooth"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
       "Ability to send HCI events to the target device, implying a proximate or paired Bluetooth attacker."
