Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect order in which the UID (User ID) and PID (Process ID) were passed during a permission check within the `LocationAccessPolicy` code. Specifically, the arguments were passed in the wrong order to the permission check function which could lead to incorrect permission granting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Parameter Order:** The core issue is that the `LocationAccessPolicy` was passing UID and PID in the wrong order to the permission check. This could lead to a bypass in the permission checks.
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is classified as Information Disclosure, indicating that this issue could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information by bypassing the intended checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Permission Bypass:** This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to location data or services by an attacker or malicious application. A malicious application could potentially gain access to location data without the required permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the device, thus requiring local access to the target device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch fixes the issue by ensuring the UID and PID are passed in the correct order to the permission check function.
- The fix was tested using `LocationAccessPolicyTest`.
- The issue is identified by bug ID 151330809.
- The vulnerability is present in AOSP version 10.
