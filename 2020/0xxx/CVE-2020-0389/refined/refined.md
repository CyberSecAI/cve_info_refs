Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0389:

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-0389 is an Information Disclosure vulnerability within the Android Framework. It arises from the improper handling of view intents, which could lead to unintended data exposure.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in how Android handles view intents. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to making view intents immutable. The provided commit message "Make view intent immutable" suggests that previously, these intents were mutable, potentially allowing for modification or inspection of the intent's data by unauthorized applications. The vulnerability is tied to the `Bug: 156959408` reference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the potential for unauthorized access to data contained within view intents. An application with malicious intent may have been able to observe or modify information within a view intent.
- **Mutability of Intents:** The root cause is the mutability of view intents prior to the fix. Mutable intents can be altered by applications, which is unsafe when they contain sensitive data or target privileged components.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain access to sensitive data being passed via view intents that were not intended for them. This could range from minor information disclosure to exposure of more critical data, depending on the intent's content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploitable by a local malicious application on the device.
- The attacker would need to intercept or interact with a view intent.
- The specific way to do this is not detailed, but it involves the improper handling of a view intent which should have been immutable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device.
- The attacker would not need elevated privileges initially but could leverage the info leak for further attacks.
-  The attacker would need the ability to intercept or otherwise interact with a view intent which has been made mutable before.

**Additional Notes:**
