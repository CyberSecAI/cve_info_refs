Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-0161:

**CVE Description:**

The provided text is part of the June 2020 Pixel Security Update bulletin. It specifically addresses CVE-2020-0161.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing size check while handling a 'sts' box in the media framework. The absence of adequate size validation could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Weakness:** The core issue is the lack of proper bounds checking or size validation in the processing of 'sts' boxes in the media framework,
*  **Impact:** An attacker could craft a malicious media file (or stream) with an oversized 'sts' box. When this malformed media is processed, it can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is the processing of a maliciously crafted media file (or stream) that contains an oversized 'sts' box.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver this malformed media to the targeted device. This could be done via a webpage, messaging app, or any other application that handles media.
*  **Affected Component:** The vulnerability exists in the Android Media Framework, specifically within a component handling the processing of media files.

**Additional Technical Details:**
The provided git commit messages give some more technical details on the fix:

*   The fix involves adding more size checking to the handling of the 'sts' box in the media framework. 
*  The patch adds a check ensuring that the size of the 'sts' data is less than a defined maximum, preventing the out-of-bounds read, thereby eliminating the DoS.
*   The second commit message explains the reasoning for this change and that the new size limit is data_size-8, which should be smaller than the previous limit.
*   Also it mentions a global atom size check of 2^26.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-0161 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Android Media Framework caused by missing size checks when processing 'sts' boxes within media files. By delivering a crafted media file with a large ‘sts’ box, an attacker can cause a device to crash or become unresponsive.
