- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unquoted service path in Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory Module Management Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software uses an unquoted service path, which can be exploited by an attacker with local access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to escalation of privileges and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user with local access to the system can exploit the unquoted service path.
