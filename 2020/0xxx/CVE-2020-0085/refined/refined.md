Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in insufficient protection of broadcasts used by the Wi-Fi framework. Specifically, broadcasts related to MAC address randomization were not restricted to privileged components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper access control on broadcasts used for Wi-Fi framework operations, particularly those related to MAC address randomization. This allows any third-party application to potentially send these broadcasts, which should only be transmitted by privileged system components.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The provided text does not explicitly state the impact of exploiting the vulnerability. However, based on the context, this could potentially allow an unprivileged application to interfere with the device's network settings or tracking by altering the MAC address. 

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** A malicious third-party application could be crafted to send the unprotected broadcast, allowing it to control aspects of the device's Wi-Fi functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Installed Application:** The attacker must have an application installed on the target device to exploit this vulnerability. No special privileges are required to transmit the broadcast.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit messages indicate that the fix involves ensuring that these broadcasts can only be transmitted by privileged components. This fix enforces proper access controls, preventing third-party apps from interfering with Wi-Fi framework operations.
- The commits also mention a related fix in the Bluetooth tethering service where the caller package name was added to `setBluetoothTethering()` to make sure the caller has proper permission. This change is related to permission enforcement in Bluetooth, not Wi-Fi, but may help in understanding the overall security improvement goals.

In summary, the core issue is that the Wi-Fi framework broadcasts were not properly protected, which could be exploited by third party apps without special permissions, leading to manipulation of the MAC address.
