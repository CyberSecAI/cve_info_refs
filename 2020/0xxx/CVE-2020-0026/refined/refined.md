  "CVE-2020-0026": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided text describes a fix for a potential out-of-bounds (OOB) write in `btm_read_remote_ext_features_complete`, which is related to CVE-2020-0026",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing length and page number check in the `btm_read_remote_ext_features_complete` function when handling HCI events. Specifically, the code was not checking if the event length or page number from the controller was correct.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Missing length check",
      "Missing page number check"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially perform an out-of-bounds write in a privileged process, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted Bluetooth transmission.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and be able to send malicious HCI events to the vulnerable device.",
     "add_info": "The fix includes adding an event length check to avoid incorrect HCI event sending from the controller and a page number check to avoid page numbers larger than `HCI_EXT_FEATURES_PAGE_MAX`."
