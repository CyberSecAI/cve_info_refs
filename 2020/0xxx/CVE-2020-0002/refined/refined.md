    "description": "The vulnerability in this section could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "root_cause": "The issue stems from the fact that `dbp_mgr` entries were only being initialized during static buffer allocations. This could lead to a use-after-free scenario during resolution changes, where these pointers might point to freed memory.",

      "Use-after-free"

    "impact": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted file"
    ],
