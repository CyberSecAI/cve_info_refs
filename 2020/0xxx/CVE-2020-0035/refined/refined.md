*   The issue stems from improper permission checks when querying `URL_SIMINFO`. This specific URL contains sensitive IDs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Attack vectors:**

*   A local malicious application can query `URL_SIMINFO` without proper permission checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have the capability to install and run a malicious application on the target device.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges other than the ability to install and execute a malicious application.

**Additional Notes:**
