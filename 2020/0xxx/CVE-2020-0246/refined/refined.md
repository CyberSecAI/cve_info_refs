Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `EuiccController#getEid` method which does not validate the calling package name. Specifically it does not verify that the package name provided belongs to the calling UID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `EuiccController#getEid` method fails to validate the package name of the calling application against the calling UID. This allows an attacker to potentially pass the package name of another application.
- **Carrier Privilege Bypass:** By providing the package name of another application that holds carrier privileges, an attacker can effectively gain these carrier privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker application can gain carrier privileges, which are intended for use by specific carrier applications.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With escalated carrier privileges, the attacker could access or modify subscription data, or perform other actions normally restricted to carrier applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Application:** A malicious application installed on the Android device is the primary attack vector. This application would need to call `EuiccController#getEid` with the package name of a target application having carrier privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device.
- **Target Package Name:** The attacker needs to know the package name of an application that has the desired carrier privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch addresses the vulnerability by adding package checking with UID in `EuiccController#getEid`.
- The commit message indicates that the issue was reported as bug 159062405.
- The vulnerability is classified as an ID (Information Disclosure) type and has a severity rating of High.
