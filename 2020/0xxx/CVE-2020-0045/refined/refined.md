{
  "CVE-2020-0045": {
    "description": "ShellSubscriber is lazily initialized, and multiple threads can attempt to write to the same pointer since it is not initialized in thread-safe code. Additionally, there is an NPE that crashes statsd when a null ResultReceiver is passed in, which allows an attacker to repeatedly crash statsd until the race condition occurs. More details, including a proof of concept attack, are in the bug.",
    "root_cause": "The `ShellSubscriber` object is initialized lazily without proper thread safety, leading to a race condition where multiple threads might attempt to initialize it simultaneously and overwrite the pointer. Also, a null pointer dereference occurs when a `null` `ResultReceiver` is passed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition due to lazy initialization without thread safety.",
      "Null pointer dereference (NPE) when a null `ResultReceiver` is passed."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can repeatedly crash statsd, and eventually, trigger the race condition. This can lead to service disruption and potentially further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to pass a `null` `ResultReceiver` to repeatedly crash statsd, and race multiple threads to trigger the race condition.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected component and pass a `null` `ResultReceiver`."
