Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-0520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue found within the `igdkmd64.sys` driver, which is part of the Intel Graphics Drivers package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `igdkmd64.sys` driver does not properly validate or sanitize file paths, allowing an attacker to potentially access files or directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a denial of service by disrupting system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have some form of access to the targeted system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the targeted system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
