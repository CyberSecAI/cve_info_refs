Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0338:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how `migrateExtraStreamToClipData()` handles URI values when a `ClipData` is not already defined.  Specifically, the function would offer to promote URI values even if a `ClipData` wasn't already defined.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper handling of undefined ClipData:** The code didn't ensure a `ClipData` value was always defined before promoting URI values.
- **Potential for unauthorized data access:** By allowing the promotion of URI values when a `ClipData` was not defined, there was a potential for later promotion and granting to be performed incorrectly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass of intended restrictions:** The vulnerability could lead to a bypass of intended restrictions during later promotion and granting of permissions related to clip data, potentially escalating privileges or providing unintended access to data or functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A local application could exploit the vulnerability by providing URI data to `migrateExtraStreamToClipData()` in a state where a `ClipData` has not yet been defined.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- A malicious local application is required to trigger the vulnerable function.

**Additional Information**
The provided commit logs highlight the fix for this vulnerability. The fix enforces that a `ClipData` value is always defined to prevent later migration and granting of permissions, thus blocking the potential for privilege escalation. The fix forces the setting of a `ClipData`, preventing the described issue.
