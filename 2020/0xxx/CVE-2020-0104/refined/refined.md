Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0104:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An implementation bug in Android Q (API level 29 or 10) was found where the system was not correctly checking the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission on apps targeting API level 28 or earlier when calling `getCellLocation`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect permission check:** The vulnerability stems from an improper permission check on the `getCellLocation` API when called by apps with a lower target API level. This leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** A malicious app with target API level of 28 or lower, could potentially bypass the proper permission check and obtain the cell location data without the user explicitly granting the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local app exploitation:** A locally installed app can exploit this vulnerability.
- **API Level Targeting:** The vulnerability is specific to applications targeting API level 28 or lower.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Malicious application:** The attacker needs to create and install a malicious Android application on the device.
- **Target API Level:** The attacker needs to target API level 28 or lower for the application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code commits show that the fix enforces the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission check for apps targeting API level 28 or earlier when using `getCellLocation`.
- The fix involves modifying the TelephonyManager service.

The Android Security Bulletin also provides some additional context:
- The vulnerability is classified as an "Information Disclosure" (ID) issue with a "Moderate" severity rating.
- The fix is included in the 2020-05-01 security patch level.
