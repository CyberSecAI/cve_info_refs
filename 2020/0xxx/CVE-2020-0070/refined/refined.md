Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the NFC (Near Field Communication) component of the Android system. Specifically, there is an out-of-bounds write issue in the `rw_t2t_ndef.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write (OOB Write):**  The core vulnerability is an OOB write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to unpredictable behavior, including code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This means the attacker could potentially gain full control over the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted file:** The attack is triggered by a remote attacker sending a specially crafted file to a vulnerable Android device. This suggests that the vulnerability may be triggered through the processing of a malicious NFC tag or data stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker can be remote, implying that they don't need physical access to the target device.
*   **Ability to send a crafted file:** The attacker needs the capability to send or cause the device to process a malicious file that exploits the OOB write in the NFC component.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided commit message references Bug IDs 147310721, 148159613, and 147310271, which are also associated with other vulnerabilities fixed in the same commit (CVE-2020-0071, CVE-2020-0072) . This indicates these CVEs may share the same root cause or fix.
*   The fix was applied to AOSP versions 8.0, 8.1, 9 and 10.
*   The commit message indicates a test was performed involving "R/W T2 tags". T2 tags are part of the NFC tag family, and this is likely the attack surface for this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-0070 is a critical vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds write in the Android NFC component. This allows a remote attacker, by sending a crafted file, to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the vulnerable device.
