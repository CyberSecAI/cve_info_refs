Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0128:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a commit referencing `CVE-2020-0128` and bug ID `A-123940919`, which is directly related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is related to a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the `soundtrigger` service. This means there's a window between when a check is made on a resource, and when that resource is actually used where the state of resource could change, leading to an exploitable state.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The core vulnerability lies in the potential race condition. The check and use of a resource within the soundtrigger component are not atomic, which can be exploited by an attacker that manipulates the resource state between the check and the use of the resource.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability could lead to information disclosure as the service could be exploited to access sensitive data that is not supposed to be accessible.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- Exploiting a race condition requires the attacker to time the changes to a resource between the check and use of the resource in soundtrigger.
- Specific details on the attack vector for this specific TOCTOU vulnerability are not available in the provided context.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `soundtrigger` service.
- The attacker also needs the capability to influence the state of a resource that is checked and subsequently used by the service, within the TOCTOU window.
- Based on the context, it seems like the attacker likely needs to be an application or process running on the device itself rather than a remote attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit message mentions "Protect against TOCTOU bugs in soundtrigger", indicating the fix is focused on preventing these types of race conditions within the soundtrigger service.
- The test procedure mentioned in the commit message ("Run the repro program vendor/google_toolbox/user/ytai/SoundTriggerPoc") indicates that a proof-of-concept exploit was likely developed to trigger the vulnerability during testing.
