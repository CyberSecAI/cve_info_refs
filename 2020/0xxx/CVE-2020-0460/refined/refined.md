Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0460:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-0460

**Description:** This vulnerability relates to an information disclosure issue found in the KeyChain component of Android.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way KeyChain handles the installation of CA certificates. When a user installs a CA certificate (typically through Settings), the system stores it in the system's KeyStore. This makes it available as a VPN trust anchor, but it's also a root CA for the whole device, which is not desirable for VPN endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The core issue is the exposure of CA certificates as general-purpose root CAs, rather than keeping them isolated for specific purposes like VPN connections. This makes the VPN provider's authentication certificate also a root certificate for the entire device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure can occur if an attacker manages to compromise a VPN provider. Since the VPN provider's auth certificate is now a root CA on the device, the attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on all device traffic, not just VPN traffic.
- Risk of impersonating any server on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the installation of a CA certificate via Settings, which then gets improperly placed in the system's KeyStore.
- Exploiting this would require an attacker to gain control over a VPN provider.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a VPN provider or be able to compromise the provider's endpoint.
- No specific user interaction is needed besides having the user install the CA certificate via the settings interface.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit message indicates a temporary fix is implemented, meaning that the long-term solution would be to handle VPN trust anchors and CA certificates in a more isolated way.
- The fix also ensures the CA certificates installed are available in VPN settings.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
