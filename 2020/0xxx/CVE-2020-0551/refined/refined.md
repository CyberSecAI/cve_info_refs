Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2020-0551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from "Load Value Injection" in some Intel processors that use speculative execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Speculative execution: The vulnerability exploits the speculative execution feature present in Intel processors.
*   Side-channel attack: The vulnerability is exploited via a side-channel, meaning the attacker infers information by observing the system's behavior rather than directly accessing the data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Information disclosure: Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access: The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have local access to the targeted machine, and be an authenticated user.
*   The attacker needs to utilize a side channel attack via speculative execution

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as MEDIUM severity with a CVSS base score of 5.6.
*   The CVSS vector is  `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`.
*   Intel released software updates to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities, particularly for Intel SGX.
*   NetApp lists the affected products and states that there are no plans to address the vulnerability in "NetApp Cloud Backup" and "NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage".
*   Intel is not aware of universal or non-universal gadgets in Operating Systems from application, VMM from VM, between guests in Virtualized environments, between different application and inside an application and is not releasing additional mitigations for these environments.
