Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0476:

**CVE-2020-0476**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a logging issue within the `ExtServices` module. Specifically, sensitive keys were being logged instead of notification to strings, which could potentially lead to information disclosure. The commit message "Log keys instead of notification.toString()"  clearly indicates the root cause.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability where sensitive key information, intended for internal use, was unintentionally exposed in logs due to incorrect use of the logging mechanism.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the logs could potentially gain access to sensitive key material which may facilitate further attacks, such as unauthorized access or data manipulation
*   **Attack vectors:** This is primarily an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker would need to gain access to the system's logs to exploit the vulnerability, often requiring some level of privilege or physical access to the device, or access to log aggregation systems.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need access to the device's system logs. This could be achieved through physical access, through a compromised application with the necessary permissions, or through unauthorized access to log aggregation systems.

The provided commit messages offer a technical description of the fix and the affected code areas but do not provide explicit details regarding exploitability.
