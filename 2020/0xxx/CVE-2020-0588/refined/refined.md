Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-0588:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the BIOS firmware of some Intel Processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The document states "BIOS firmware for some Intel Processors is susceptible to vulnerabilities". The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed beyond that.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information
    *   Addition or modification of data
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   For CVE-2020-0588 specifically, the CVSS score indicates the impact is:
    *   No Confidentiality impact
    *   High Integrity impact
    *   No Availability impact

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The CVSS vector string for CVE-2020-0588 is `CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N`, which translates to:
    *   **AV:P (Physical):** The attacker needs physical access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **AC:H (High):** The attack requires specialized access conditions, making it difficult to exploit.
    *  **PR:H (High):** The attacker needs high privileges (e.g., administrator) to exploit the vulnerability.
    *  **UI:R (Required):**  User interaction is required to perform the exploit.
    *  **S:U (Unchanged):**  The vulnerability has no impact on other components beyond the one exploited.
    *   **C:N (None):** No Confidentiality impact.
    *   **I:H (High):** High Integrity impact.
    *   **A:N (None):** No Availability impact.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs physical access to the system.
*   The attacker needs high privileges on the system.
*   The attack requires user interaction.
*   The complexity of the attack is considered high, meaning that it is difficult to exploit.

**Additional Notes**

*   This advisory bundles several CVEs related to Intel BIOS firmware vulnerabilities under `NTAP-20201113-0001`.
*   NetApp has released fixes for Clustered Data ONTAP and FAS/AFF BIOS to address these vulnerabilities.
*   NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) will not be patched as it is at the end of its lifecycle.
