Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is related to an "avoid overflow". The commit message "String16::remove - avoid overflow" indicates that the fix prevents a potential buffer overflow in the String16::remove function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `String16::remove` function. This implies that the function was not properly checking the size of data being removed from a String16 object, allowing a larger amount of data to be removed than available which can lead to writing out of bounds, resulting in a crash or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The provided text classifies the vulnerability as EoP with a High severity. The text also mentions that a local attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using this library.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the overflow, an attacker can potentially overwrite memory regions and gain the ability to execute code within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited locally, meaning an attacker would need to have some form of access or ability to execute code on the targeted device.
*   **Specific Library Usage:** The attack is specific to applications that utilize the vulnerable `String16` class/library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to run code within the context of a vulnerable application on the targeted system. This could involve having an app on the device that uses the library, or by gaining some other form of access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix was added to AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and is available in versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, 10, and 11, as stated in the Android Security Bulletin.
*   The issue is referenced by the Android bug ID A-156999009.
* The commit message explicitly mentions "avoid overflow"
