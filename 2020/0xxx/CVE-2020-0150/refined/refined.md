  "CVE-2020-0150": {
    "description": "The provided information indicates a vulnerability in the `INetworkManagementService#setIPv6AddrGenMode` function. The vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check, which could allow any app to call the function via an IPC (Inter-Process Communication). However, due to a bug in the IPC, the mode can only be set to “stable privacy”, limiting the impact. The affected code is unused, as the network stack calls the netd IPC directly. ",
    "root_cause": "Missing permission check in `INetworkManagementService#setIPv6AddrGenMode` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing permission check"
    ],
    "impact": "Potentially, an app could transitively call `netd setIPv6AddrGenMode` IPC which could modify the IPv6 address generation mode.",
     "attack_vectors": "Any app could call the vulnerable function via IPC.",
    "required_capabilities": "Any application."
