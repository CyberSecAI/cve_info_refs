- The CVE-2020-0173 entry in the security bulletin:
   - A-127313764 [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/%2B/7f9e1dd397495e00337b7e910bd2fa1759ce9f86](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/%2B/7f9e1dd397495e00337b7e910bd2fa1759ce9f86) [[2](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/166a84bfe31457fe44dcb90294d33089d2a3f428)] | DoS | Moderate | 10
   - Indicates this CVE relates to a Denial of Service vulnerability in the Media Framework.
This information strongly suggests that the content is related to CVE-2020-0173.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a third-party MIDI extractor code that can get stuck in an infinite (or very long) loop during the extraction process. This occurs when a crafted or corrupted MIDI file is processed.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper timeout handling within the MIDI extraction process. When the extractor encounters a problematic MIDI file, it fails to terminate and gets stuck. This leads to a denial of service condition.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). An attacker could provide a specially crafted MIDI file to cause the media extraction service to hang, thereby causing a crash of the process that relies on it. This can lead to instability and prevent functionality on the affected device that depends on the media framework.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted MIDI file. The attacker needs to provide this malformed or unusually long MIDI file to the vulnerable process
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to submit a crafted MIDI file that triggers the infinite loop within the media extractor. This could be done via a media playing application or through any other part of the system that can interact with the media framework. The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided commit messages explicitly state that crashing the process is intended behavior as a recovery mechanism. It indicates that hardening the third-party MIDI extractor code directly is difficult. By timing out and crashing the service, the device is able to recover from a stuck state due to a bad MIDI file.
* The security bulletin identifies the vulnerability as a Denial of Service (DoS) with a Moderate severity rating.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-0173 describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Android Media framework. The vulnerability occurs when a third-party MIDI extractor gets stuck in an infinite loop while processing a specially crafted MIDI file. This results in the service crashing, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
