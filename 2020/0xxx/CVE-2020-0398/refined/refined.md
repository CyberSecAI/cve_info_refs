Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0398:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of broadcasts related to "Icon," "deauth imminent," and "subscription remediation" within the Passpoint feature. These broadcasts were not necessary and, more critically, were exposing the Passpoint AP BSSID without location permission.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of the Passpoint AP BSSID without requiring location permissions. This can be leveraged to track a user.
- **Unnecessary Broadcasts:** The presence of unused and unnecessary broadcasts increases the attack surface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** A malicious application can obtain the BSSID of the Wi-Fi network the user is connected to. This information, combined with other data, can be used to track the userâ€™s location.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  While not explicitly detailed, the BSSID information could be used as a starting point for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Broadcast Sniffing:** A malicious app with no location permission can listen to the mentioned broadcasts to obtain the BSSID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Malicious App Installation:** The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the target device.
- **No Location Permission Required:** The malicious app can obtain the sensitive information without needing location permissions, making the attack easier to perform.

**Additional details:**
The provided code changes indicate that the vulnerability was addressed by removing the R2 broadcasts for "Icon," "deauth imminent," and "subscription remediation" within the Passpoint functionality. This action effectively removes the information exposure vulnerability.
The commit message explicitly mentions that these broadcasts were "not necessary" and "leaked the Passpoint AP BSSID without location permission."
The fix also includes a test case which verifies proper operation of the PasspointManager
The vulnerability is also confirmed to be present in the Android security bulletin for October 2020 as CVE-2020-0398, with a severity of "High" and classified as "Information Disclosure".
