  "CVE-2020-0066": {
    "description": "The provided data indicates that CVE-2020-0066 is related to a vulnerability in the Netlink driver in the Linux kernel.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an improper skb (socket buffer) trimming in the netlink_dump function. Specifically, the skb was not being trimmed to the allocated size, leading to potential MSG_TRUNC errors when a user provided a buffer smaller than the actual skb size.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper buffer size management in netlink_dump function.",
      "Potential information disclosure through message truncation when reading via netlink."
    ],
    "impact": "A user with sufficient privileges could cause a MSG_TRUNC error by providing a small buffer while reading from netlink. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) like condition or the inability to obtain complete data from the netlink interface. This could also lead to information disclosure by only obtaining part of the information if the user is not aware of the truncation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by sending netlink requests to trigger the vulnerability in the netlink_dump function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to interact with the netlink interface",
       "Sufficient privileges to trigger a netlink dump operation"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The patch trims the skb to the allocated size in the `netlink_dump` function before sending the response to the user, preventing the MSG_TRUNC error. The patch ensures the skb buffer is no larger than expected by user space so user space can always allocate a reasonable buffer for it. The allocated size is determined by the larger of `cb->min_dump_alloc` and `NLMSG_GOODSIZE`, or the maximum user provided buffer size `nlk->max_recvmsg_len`. The skb is trimmed after it has been allocated."
