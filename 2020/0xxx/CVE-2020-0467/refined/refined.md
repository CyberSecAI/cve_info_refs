Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the incorrect storage of the `mLockdown` value within settings when a user is stopped. Specifically, when a user is stopped, the `Vpn#onUserStopped()` function is called, and the value of `mLockdown` is incorrectly set to false and stored into settings. This behavior is incorrect because the user stopping shouldn't change the `mLockdown` state. As a result, `Vpn#saveAlwaysOnPackage()` is unnecessarily called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect State Handling:** The system incorrectly modifies and stores a VPN lockdown state upon user stoppage, which shouldn't be happening.
- **Unnecessary Function Call:** The system incorrectly calls the  `Vpn#saveAlwaysOnPackage()` function when the user is stopped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
While the provided text doesn't specify the exact impact of this vulnerability, the fact that it involves improper handling of VPN lockdown state suggests it could lead to an inconsistent or incorrect VPN configuration. This is classified as an "ID" (Information Disclosure) vulnerability. It could potentially lead to an attacker manipulating or bypassing the VPN connection for the user when it should be active, thus leaking information or bypassing the VPN which is supposed to provide security.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a local user being stopped, which leads to the incorrect update of the `mLockdown` setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need the ability to control or influence the user stopping process on the device.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix is related to ensuring that `mLockdown` is only updated when it is intentionally changed.
- The fix avoids an unnecessary call to `Vpn#saveAlwaysOnPackage()` when the user is stopped
- The code changes associated with the fix are in this commit: `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/%2B/61b620ad4f773e86c03e0719ae24268babcc62a9`
