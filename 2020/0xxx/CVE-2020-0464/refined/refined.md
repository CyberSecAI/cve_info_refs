Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-0464:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue related to how network configuration changes are broadcasted within the Android system. Specifically, the `WifiConfig` object was being sent within the `CONFIGURED_NETWORKS_CHANGED_ACTION` broadcast. Due to privacy concerns, this practice was discontinued. The vulnerability exists because the system still tries to access this information from the broadcast, which is no longer present.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure (ID): The vulnerability is classified as an information disclosure issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive network configuration information. The specific details of the information that could be disclosed are not detailed but would involve wifi configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
A local malicious application may be able to leverage this vulnerability to access this network configuration information. The specific steps for exploitation are not detailed, but would likely involve monitoring or intercepting the relevant broadcast.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the capability to install and run a malicious application on the target Android device. The application would need to have the necessary permissions to receive broadcasts and potentially interact with network settings.

**Additional notes**
The provided content is more detailed than the description provided by the CVE ID, which was a placeholder. The fix involves stopping the practice of sending the `WifiConfig` object and instead querying the `WifiManager` for matching configurations to update, and thus avoid information disclosure through broadcasts.
