Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `IsolatedUidAllocator` when handling non-primary users. Specifically, the allocator stores complete UIDs (User IDs), not app IDs. When removing a UID from the range, the system should use the UID, not the app ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of User IDs (UIDs) versus app IDs within the `IsolatedUidAllocator`.
-  The allocator stores complete UIDs, not app IDs and when removing a UID from the range it should also use the UID, not the app ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Elevation of Privilege (EoP). This indicates an attacker could potentially gain higher-level access or permissions than intended.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Android framework, specifically related to how UIDs are allocated and managed for non-primary users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the specific code path in the `IsolatedUidAllocator` where the incorrect ID handling occurs. This likely requires an understanding of Android's user management and UID allocation mechanisms.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided code changes fix the issue by using the UID, instead of the app ID, when removing UIDs from the range.
- A test was added to cover this specific scenario.
- This CVE is marked as "Moderate" severity.
