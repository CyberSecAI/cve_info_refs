Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0471:

**CVE-2020-0471**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the Bluetooth component of the Android system. Specifically, it seems related to how the system handles register notification commands, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds (OOB) write vulnerability exists within the Bluetooth library (`libbluetooth`). This can be triggered when a remote attacker sends a crafted register notification command.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to elevation of privilege (EoP). This means an attacker could potentially gain higher privileges than they should have.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote through a crafted Bluetooth register notification command. An attacker could send this command over the Bluetooth interface.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of a vulnerable device and have the ability to send crafted Bluetooth packets.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided git commit messages indicate that the fix involves dropping broadcasts to mitigate the OOB write.
*   The commit message also mentions "Check event id if of register notification command from remote to avoid OOB write", which is a more detailed description of the issue and the fix.
*   The CVE is listed under the "System" component in the Android Security Bulletin for January 2021.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, 10, and 11.
