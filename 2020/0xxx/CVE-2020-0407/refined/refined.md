  "CVE-2020-0407": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided text describes a vulnerability in the F2FS (Flash-Friendly File System) where a crafted USB descriptor can cause a cyclic chain of entities in the UVC (USB Video Class) driver, leading to a crash.",
    "root_cause": "A self-referential source ID in the output terminal descriptor allows an entity to be added to its own chain list twice, resulting in a loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of self-referential source IDs.",
      "Lack of proper checks to prevent cyclic chain creation."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a crash due to the cyclic chain formation. This is achieved by malformed USB descriptors and it can lead to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious USB device with a crafted output terminal descriptor.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the USB device presented to the system, with the ability to present a crafted descriptor that includes the vulnerability."
