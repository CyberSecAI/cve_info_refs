  "cveId": "CVE-2020-0499",
  "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the FLAC audio decoder can lead to a denial of service. This vulnerability is triggered in `FLAC__bitreader_read_rice_signed_block` function in `bitreader.c` when handling crafted FLAC files.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "An out-of-bounds read in the `FLAC__bitreader_read_rice_signed_block` function due to a heap buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
     "impact": "Denial of service by crashing the application or service due to the out-of-bounds read.",
    "attackVector": "Maliciously crafted FLAC audio files.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted FLAC file to be processed by the vulnerable software. User interaction (opening the crafted file) may be required."
  },
  "affectedComponents": [
    "libFLAC",
    "Android Framework (Media framework)",
    "Fedora packages (flac, mingw-flac)",
    "Debian packages (flac)"
  ],
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability lies in the way the FLAC decoder handles the Rice encoding method, which can lead to reading memory outside of the intended buffer. The vulnerability is fixed by initializing the allocated memory, preventing invalid indices from being accessed. The fix is present in the upstream commit: https://github.com/xiph/flac/commit/2e7931c27eb15e387da440a37f12437e35b22dd4. The Android fix can be found here: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/flac/+/029048f823ced50f63a92e25073427ec3a9bd909",
