    "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. The vulnerability has a severity of 'Moderate'.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted media files.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to provide a malicious HEVC encoded file to a vulnerable system for processing."
