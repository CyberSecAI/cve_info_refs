  "CVE-2020-0431": {
    "Description": "In kbd_keycode of keyboard.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
    "Root cause": "A missing bounds check in the kbd_keycode function of keyboard.c can lead to an out of bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local escalation of privilege.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local",
    "Required capabilities": "No special capabilities required, local user access is enough."

   "CVE-2020-14381": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's futex implementation. This flaw allows a local attacker to corrupt system memory or escalate their privileges when creating a futex on a filesystem that is about to be unmounted.",
    "Root cause": "A local attacker can corrupt system memory or escalate their privileges when creating a futex on a filesystem that is about to be unmounted due to a flaw in the futex implementation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"

   "CVE-2020-14386": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes.",
    "Root cause": "Memory corruption in af_packet.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Gain root privileges from unprivileged processes, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.",

    "CVE-2020-14390": {
    "Description": "When changing screen size, an out-of-bounds memory write can occur leading to memory corruption or a denial of service. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.",
