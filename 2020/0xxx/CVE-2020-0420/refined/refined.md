Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-0420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the `setUpdateableDriverPath` function is handled within the `GpuService` component. This function, which is responsible for setting the path for updateable GPU drivers, should only be called by `system_server`. It appears that there is a missing lock mechanism to properly protect this function, which could be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local malicious application can bypass user interaction requirements and gain access to additional permissions by exploiting the missing lock on the `setUpdateableDriverPath` function.
- **Missing Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access controls on the `setUpdateableDriverPath` function. This function, meant to be restricted to system processes, can be accessed by unauthorized applications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Gain Additional Permissions:** A malicious app can potentially elevate its privileges to gain access to system-level permissions by setting a malicious driver path, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to set an arbitrary driver path could potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges by manipulating the GPU driver update process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the affected device.
- **No User Interaction Required:** According to the CVE description, the vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any user interaction to grant further permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit message highlights the fix: securing the `setUpdateableDriverPath` function to only be callable by `system_server`.
- The commit also mentions the need to protect the developer driver path.
- The fix is linked to AOSP change I48896325598acab89079dbc658ddf9b92d303244, which is associated with bug A-162383705.
