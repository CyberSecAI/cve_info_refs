- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A predictable temporary file vulnerability exists in PAN-OS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure creation of temporary files using predictable names.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated user with shell access can corrupt arbitrary system files, which affects the integrity of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system with shell access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local, authenticated user with shell access and high privileges.
