Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1716

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `ceph-ansible` playbook contained hardcoded default passwords within the `roles/ceph-defaults/defaults/main.yml` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The presence of hardcoded passwords constitutes a significant security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit the hardcoded credentials to brute-force Ceph deployments.
- Successful exploitation grants administrator access to Ceph clusters via the Ceph dashboard.
- With admin access, an attacker could initiate read, write, and delete operations on Ceph clusters, as well as modify cluster configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an authenticated attacker leveraging the hardcoded passwords within the `ceph-ansible` playbook to gain unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the Ceph deployment which was setup using the vulnerable playbook or have access to the playbook and then use the hardcoded credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was located in `roles/ceph-defaults/defaults/main.yml`, specifically around lines 701 and 711 of the referenced file in the `ceph-ansible` repository.
- The issue was fixed in `ceph-ansible` version 6.0.0alpha1.
- Mitigation steps involve changing and using strong passwords in the `ceph-ansible` playbook.
- Red Hat addressed this issue in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4.1 via RHSA-2020:2231.
