Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-12693:

**Root Cause:**
*   A race condition exists in Slurm when message aggregation is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Authentication bypass is possible via an alternate path or channel.
*   The vulnerability occurs specifically when message aggregation is enabled, which is not the default configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A user can launch a process as an arbitrary user.
*   This leads to unauthorized privilege escalation and potentially full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based exploitation is possible, according to NVD, although SUSE rates it as local. The attack requires exploiting a race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a local user and be able to trigger the race condition. The NVD suggests network access may be possible with high complexity, although this is not indicated in the bugzilla report.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a message to Slurm that causes the race condition while message aggregation is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Slurm versions 19.05.x before 19.05.7 and 20.02.x before 20.02.3.
*   The standard configuration of Slurm is not vulnerable, as message aggregation is not enabled by default.
*   A patch is available to address this issue by unconditionally enabling user verification on batch jobs and avoiding callbacks with message aggregation.
*   The provided bugzilla link indicates that fixes for this vulnerability have been released by SUSE, and the openSUSE security mailing list also confirms the availability of patches for affected openSUSE products.

The content from `www.suse.com` also shows that the vulnerability is considered of moderate severity and lists several SUSE Security Advisories and affected packages.
