Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of password length restrictions in the IPA (Identity, Policy, Audit) component. This allows an attacker to send extremely long passwords to the server during authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper input validation for password length. The system does not limit the number of characters in a password, leading to excessive resource consumption.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Processing excessively long passwords, especially during the hashing process, consumes significant CPU and memory resources on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a password with a large number of characters (>= 1,000,000), an attacker can exhaust the server's resources, leading to a denial of service. The targeted system becomes unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authentication Attempts:** The attack is triggered by attempting to authenticate with an excessively long password. This can be done through any interface that allows user authentication, such as the web interface or other API endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the IPA server to send authentication requests with large passwords.
*   **Authentication Interface Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the authentication interface of the vulnerable IPA system to attempt a login.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered low severity and low priority as per the FreeIPA team.
*   **Fix:** The issue has been fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 via errata RHSA-2020:3936 and RHSA-2020:4670 respectively.
*   **Upstream Fix:** The fix has been merged into the FreeIPA upstream but without a dedicated release.
*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable component is related to password handling within the IPA system.
