- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication of a specific interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper authentication for a specific interface allows access without authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can perform unauthorized operations by accessing the interface. This could lead to compromise of the device and data.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the affected device is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable device.
