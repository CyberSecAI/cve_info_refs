Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1887:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect validation of the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) hostname within the osquery HTTP client. Specifically, the hostname verification was not being enforced, allowing connections to proceed even if the certificate presented by the server did not match the hostname osquery was trying to connect to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-297:** Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch. The osquery client was not properly verifying that the hostname in the server's TLS certificate matched the intended destination hostname.
- Missing hostname verification during TLS handshake.
- The `boost::asio::ssl::rfc2818_verification` callback, which enforces hostname verification, was not being used by default, or was not properly initialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by intercepting network traffic between osquery and a remote server.
- This could allow the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive information or manipulate data being exchanged between osquery and the remote server.
- The attacker can impersonate the legitimate server by presenting a valid certificate for a different hostname, which the vulnerable osquery client would accept.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based MITM attack.
- An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the osquery client and the remote server.
- The attacker would need to intercept the TLS handshake and present a fraudulent certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over network infrastructure in the path between the osquery client and the remote server.
- The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network packets.
- The attacker needs to have a valid TLS certificate for a different hostname than the intended target, allowing it to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and the certificate must be trusted by the client (or the client must not check the certificate).

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves using the `boost::asio::ssl::rfc2818_verification` callback within the `encryptConnection` function of the `http_client`.
- The fix also includes a regression test to ensure that hostname verification is working correctly.
- The vulnerability was present in osquery versions after 2.9.0 and before 4.2.0.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #6197 and merged into the main branch.
