This lgtm overall, did we address the best way to communicate this change to the community? Perhaps an announcement blog post on the site would be useful to alert users of this potential issue in their deployment?

| Thanks for the bugfix! Can you please describe the conditions where the bug is present, what the bug is, and if there is security impact?  Is there a potential test to make sure the bug is mitigated?  This fixes an issue that has been reported by a user about how the server certificate is verified against the hostname osquery is trying to connect to. Without this callback, Boost always allows the connection regardless.  We can try to tweak the verification settings and see if we can just validate the hostname check in the tests! |

I definitely like the restructuring in [#6044](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6044), [@alessandrogario](https://github.com/alessandrogario) is there anyway you could rebase on top of that PR and just keep the callback for the sni verification? |

So, looks like the ordering we'd desire here would be ship [#6170](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6170), then ship [#6044](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6044), then this PR, and work on getting some testing for this which should be relatively easy after [#6170](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6170) lands. I'm going to request changes on this just to "remove it from the queue" until the other PRs ship.

Nit: lets make this a normal std::string, the `rfc2818_verification` constructor takes a string; I would then pass `.c_str()` to `SSL_set_tlsext_host_name`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Before this commit it was possible to have osquery accept
a valid certificate with a wrong hostname.
The commit fixes this adding the hostname verification.

Moreover:

- Regenerate test CA, server certificates and keys, so that
  the CA key is available, to be able to sign other test certs.
- Add a regression test for the hostname verification bug.

Does this need to be declared so high up? I'm not seeing anything making modifications to `client_options_.remote_hostname_` or using `remote_hostname` until we check it in the callback. Could we remove this and just pass `*client_options_.remote_hostname_` directly in the callback?

This kinda makes me nervous, as it seems to suggest we don't verify the hostname by default. Under what circumstances would we *not* want to verify? Wouldn't it just be with something like `--tls_allow_unsafe=true` or if the cert paths aren't set? Could we make this default to `true` and then only set to `false` if `client_options_.always_verify_peer_` is `false` or the like? What do you think?

Well hostname is not verified until we set the verify\_mode to `verify_peer` in the context, so I was just following that functionality.

Also the context is local to the encryptConnection function, so it cannot change outside.

That been said I could envision a different problem indeed, where there's a new case where verify\_peer is enabled and the verify hostname enabling is forgotten.

I guess I could just always set it; would've preferred to have it clearly showing that it depends on the `verify_peer` mode, but the context cannot be queried it seems.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Gotcha. I think I'd be in favor of always setting it, but that's because I'm having a lot of trouble imaging scenarios where you wouldn't want this verification enabled, and more over I think leveraging the `--tls_allow_unsafe=true` should be a sufficient work around for anyone wanting to do testing and the like?

Keep in mind that `verify_peer` already behaves like that in the context of the encryptConnection function: it's false by default and becomes true only if we explicitly set it.

I was reasoning completely in the context of that specific function because whatever external change is happening, it's not reflected in that function if not through the client\_option settings.

I did not touch `verify_peer` because I was focusing on the hostname verification, but if we want to pursue this (correct) mentality, I'll change that to be enabled by default :).

Ah ok, that makes sense. Perhaps for the sake of this PR let's leave things as they are then so that we're pattern matching. For changing the default behavior of this to be enabled by default, maybe let's start a broader discussion in Slack to get more folks to weigh in, what do you think?
