Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that BCC recipients of emails are visible in the article details on the external interface of OTRS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary weakness is the unintended exposure of BCC recipient information. BCC recipients are meant to be hidden from other recipients, and this vulnerability breaks that privacy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Breach: Unauthorized users who have access to the article details via the external interface can view the BCC recipients of emails, which might reveal private information or expose individuals who were intended to be kept hidden from public view.

**Attack Vectors:**
- External Interface Access: The attack vector is through accessing the article detail view via OTRS's external interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user with access to the article details on the external interface. The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), and also requires user interaction (UI:R) to be exploited.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows a low-privileged user, through the external interface of OTRS, to view BCC recipients of email communications that are not meant to be public or visible to other users by viewing the article details, resulting in a confidentiality breach.
