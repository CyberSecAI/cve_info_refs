Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1421

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Type confusion within the parsing of LNK files in `StructuredQuery.dll`. Specifically, a crafted `LeafCondition` element within an LNK file can trigger this type confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of data types during the parsing of LNK files, leading to a type confusion. This can cause the program to misinterpret the data, leading to exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means the attacker can gain control of the system with the same privileges as the user who triggered the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious LNK files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted LNK file.
*   **Visiting a Malicious Page:**  It is also possible to trigger the vulnerability by visiting a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction. The target must either open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the malicious file or webpage can be delivered through various means, such as email or web links.
