Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect normalization of the `servletPath` by the Undertow servlet container. The container truncates the path after a semicolon, leading to a partial `servletPath`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Path Normalization:**  The servlet container does not correctly handle semicolons in the URL path, leading to a truncated `servletPath`.
- **Application Mapping Issue:** The truncated path can lead to incorrect application mapping, where a request intended for a specific resource is routed to another based on the altered `servletPath`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Bypass:** The incorrect mapping can lead to security bypasses, where an attacker can gain access to resources they are not authorized to access.  This depends on how URL-based security is implemented in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL that contains a semicolon.  For example, a URL like `/api/public/aa/secret` can be manipulated by adding a semicolon: `/api/public/aa;something/secret`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific privileges are needed, and the attacker can be in any network position to send the request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Undertow versions prior to 2.0.30.SP1 and 2.1.0.Final.
-  A mitigation is available by configuring `UrlPathHelper` to ignore the servletPath by setting "alwaysUseFullPath".
-  The issue has been addressed in various Red Hat products, including JBoss EAP, Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, Red Hat Fuse, and Red Hat Data Grid.
