- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory management error exists in the IPSec module when handling a specific message, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can cause a 1-byte out-of-bounds read, potentially compromising normal service.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can send specific crafted messages to the affected product via network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device and the device must be processing IPSec traffic.
