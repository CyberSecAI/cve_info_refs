Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-1207:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition in the handling of palette objects within the `win32kfull` component of Microsoft Windows. Specifically, the code fails to validate the existence of an object before attempting to operate on it, leading to the use of a freed memory region.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free, meaning the program attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The absence of proper validation before operating on palette objects allows the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level. This grants the attacker full control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By escalating privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the SYSTEM user, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker needs to achieve low-privilege code execution on the system before they can attempt to trigger this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** An attacker needs to have some level of access to the target system to execute code.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
