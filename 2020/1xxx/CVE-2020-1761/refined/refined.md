Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-1761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The OpenShift web console stores access tokens in the browser's local storage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insecure Storage:** Storing access tokens in browser local storage makes them accessible to malicious scripts running within the browser and attackers with physical access to the machine.
-   **XSS Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is exploitable if an XSS vulnerability exists in the web console.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Access Token Theft:** Attackers can steal access tokens.
-   **Account Compromise:** Stolen access tokens can be used to impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to the OpenShift platform.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to a user's computer can potentially extract the access token from local storage.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an XSS vulnerability exists in the OpenShift web console, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code to steal the access token from local storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Physical Access:** Requires physical access to the user's machine to access local storage directly.
-   **XSS Exploitation:** Requires the ability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser session accessing the OpenShift web console.
