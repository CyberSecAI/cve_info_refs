### Description

A missing authorization vulnerability in the management server component of PAN-OS Panorama allows a remote unauthenticated user to inject messages into the management server ms.log file. This vulnerability can be leveraged to obfuscate an ongoing attack or fabricate log entries in the ms.log file

This issue affects:

All versions of PAN-OS 7.1 and 8.0;

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.14;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.9.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.9 | >= 9.0.9 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.14 | >= 8.1.14 |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | 8.0.\* | None |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | 7.1.\* | None |

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
5.3 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-862 Missing Authorization](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.14, PAN-OS 9.0.9 (pending release), and all later PAN-OS versions.

PAN-OS 8.0 is now end-of-life as of October 31, 2019, and is no longer covered by our Product Security Assurance policies.

PAN-OS 7.1 is on extended support until June 30, 2020, and is only being considered for critical security vulnerability fixes.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Attacks against this issue can be blocked with signatures for Unique Threat ID 58197 enabled on a different firewall configured to protect the vulnerable management interfaces.

This issue affects the management interface of PAN-OS and is strongly mitigated by following best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com>.

### Acknowledgments

This issue was found by Ben Nott of Palo Alto Networks during internal security review.
