  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation in `MediaTypeHeaderDelegate.java`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `MediaTypeHeaderDelegate.java` class does not properly validate input, leading to the return of an illegal header. The illegal header is then integrated into the server's response.",
        "The improper validation could allow for injection, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the HTTP response is constructed."
    ],
    "impact": "An injection, which leads to unexpected behavior when the HTTP response is constructed.",

      "Sending a crafted response header that bypasses the improper input validation."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted response headers to the server running RESTEasy."
