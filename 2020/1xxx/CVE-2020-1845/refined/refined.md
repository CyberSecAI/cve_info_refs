- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Huawei PCManager product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an authenticated local attacker to perform specific operations leading to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain higher privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system. Specific operations must be performed by the attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system and have local access.
