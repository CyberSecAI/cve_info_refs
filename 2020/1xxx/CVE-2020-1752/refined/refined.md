Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1752:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents directly mention "CVE-2020-1752" and describe a vulnerability related to the GNU C Library (glibc), confirming its relevance. Specifically, the vulnerability is a use-after-free related to tilde expansion handled by the `glob` function, which is consistent with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `glob` function within glibc. This occurs during the expansion of directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username (e.g., `~/user/path`).

**Technical Details:**

- The `glob` function allocates memory for directory names. When expanding paths like `~user/path`, it extracts the username, looks up the user's home directory, and constructs a full path.
- The code uses a variable called `dirname`, and `end_name` which is a pointer into `dirname`. The allocated memory for dirname is freed, but the code then proceeds to access `end_name`. This results in a use-after-free.
- The vulnerability was introduced in glibc 2.14 with commit `f2962a71959fd254a7a223437ca4b63b9e81130c`

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Use-after-free: The code attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- Inadequate memory management: The code deallocates `dirname` before the last use of end_name which point into dirname, resulting in a use-after-free.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker could potentially craft a specific path that, when processed by the vulnerable `glob` function, leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use-after-free could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. The Netapp advisory also list the impact as potentially leading to "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data".

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by a local attacker providing a specially crafted path with a tilde (`~`) followed by a username to the `glob` function.
- The `glob` function is used in various applications to expand wildcards and resolve paths, so this is a common vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code locally on the system that is running vulnerable glibc version.
- **User Privilege:**  The attacker can be an unprivileged user and does not need any special permissions, however in some instances may require a setuid program that calls the vulnerable function.
- **Control of Input:** The attacker must be able to control the input string passed to the vulnerable `glob` function and create a malicious path with a valid username.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in glibc versions prior to 2.32.
*   The fix involves changing the order of operations so that the value of `end_name` is no longer used after the memory associated with `dirname` is freed.
*   NetApp has released specific patches for some affected products but also notes that some products will not be patched due to end-of-life.
*   Ubuntu has also released patches for affected versions.
*   Debian LTS advisory DLA-3152-1 lists CVE-2020-1752 alongside other glibc vulnerabilities and recommends upgrading the glibc packages.
*   Red Hat has classified the impact as medium, and states they will not patch RHEL 7 because of EOL but have created a patch for RHEL 8 (RHSA-2020:4444).
*   The sourceware bugzilla lists the fix being included in glibc versions 2.31 and 2.32.
*   The NetApp advisories provide a detailed list of affected products and those that are not affected as well as links to the patches when applicable.

**Summary of extracted information:**

-   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free in glibc's `glob` function during tilde expansion.
-   **Vulnerability:** Memory management error, specifically the freeing of `dirname` before `end_name` which points into it.
-  **Impact:** Potential arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other impacts such as "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data".
-   **Attack Vector:**  Local user passing a specially crafted path containing a tilde to the `glob` function.
-   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access with the ability to execute code and control input to glob function.
