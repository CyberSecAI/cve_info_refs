## Description

![@kelset](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16104054?u=b1789afba151cb08ff7c2a9940880bc51fb72a52&v=4&size=48)[kelset](https://github.com/kelset)opened [on May 5, 2021](https://github.com/react-native-community/releases/issues/224#issue-876274209)

Conversations on this thread are limited to 0.64 releases major issues and backport (cherry-pick) requests from commits that are already on master.

An example of a good such request is a bug fix for a serious issue that has been merged into master but did not make the 0.64.1 cut, with a link to the specific commit hash on master with the commit to cherry-pick, like this example link: [facebook/react-native@bd2b7d6](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/bd2b7d6c0366b5f19de56b71cb706a0af4b0be43)

In other words, if you cannot point to a particular commit on master, then your request likely belongs as a new issue in [http://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues).

**PRs to merge:**

* [fix: update to @jest/create-cache-key-function@27 facebook/react-native#30637](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/30637)
* [fix: codegen - project paths with spaces facebook/react-native#31141](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31141) -> [facebook/react-native@b2e2f43](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b2e2f43ec3d43a36c4682bf3f92b0154cc2dc55f)
* [Add mocks to fix: handleException is not a function (#29849) facebook/react-native#30027](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/30027)
* [Fix cli bundle platform for Mac Catalyst in `react-native-xcode.sh` facebook/react-native#31062](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31062)

**Ready for cherry-pick**:

* [[Fix] `Android`: font-family is not apply when secureTextEntry is true facebook/react-native#30164](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/30164) -> [facebook/react-native@00d9dea](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/00d9deaf6ba26c605694d303bb0cb072fceae5a1)

* [[0.64.0] archive fails for release due to invalid check for custom ENTRY\_FILE facebook/react-native#31282](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31282)

[v0.64.1](/facebook/react-native/tree/v0.64.1)

[`787567a`](/facebook/react-native/commit/787567a15014c73b87353b7d418c064c5643e7cc)

This patch release is specifically targetted towards fixing iOS build problems in Xcode 12.5. If it doesn't help, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31480).

Aside from bumping your version from 0.64.0 to 0.64.1, please check your podfile.lock and make sure that Flipper is on 0.75 or higher, and Flipper-Folly is 2.5.3 or higher; if not, add this line to your podfile (or modify it if you already had it):

```
use_flipper!('Flipper' => '0.75.1', 'Flipper-Folly' => '2.5.3', 'Flipper-RSocket' => '1.3.1')

```

After which, do all the classic necessary cleans (node\_modules, caches, pod folders, etc)([react-native-clean-project](https://github.com/pmadruga/react-native-clean-project) is your ally) then do `yarn install` and a `pod install --repo-update` (if pod install fails on an error about a Flipper package, just remove the relevant lines from the podfile.lock and run the pod install again).

The only other commit picked & released along the Xcode 12.5 fixes is:

* Update validateBaseUrl to use latest regex ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ca09ae82715e33c9ac77b3fa55495cf84ba891c7)) which fixes [CVE-2020-1920](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7f53-fmmv-mfjv "CVE-2020-1920"), GHSL-2020-293.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
