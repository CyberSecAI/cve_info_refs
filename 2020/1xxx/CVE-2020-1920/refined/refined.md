Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) flaw within the `validateBaseUrl` function in `react-native`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inefficient Regular Expression:** The original regular expression used to validate URLs in the `validateBaseUrl` function was susceptible to ReDoS attacks. Specifically, the regex `^(?:(?:(?:https?|ftp):)?\/\/)(?:(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[01]\d|22[0-3])(?:\.(?:1?\d{1,2}|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2}(?:\.(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-4]))|(?:(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]-\*)\*[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]+)(?:\.(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]-\*)\*[a-z\u00a1-\uffff0-9]+)\*(?:\.(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff]{2,}))?)(?::\d{2,5})?(?:[/?#]\S\*)?$/i` was vulnerable
*   **CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion):** The vulnerable regex could consume excessive CPU resources when processing specially crafted, malicious URLs, due to its backtracking nature.
*  **CWE-697 (Insufficient Comparison):** This is mentioned in the advisory as a weakness alongside CWE-400, but the exact nature of how it relates isn't explained within the provided context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful ReDoS attack could lead to excessive resource consumption, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash. This impacts the availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network based. An attacker could send a crafted URL through a network to the vulnerable application leading to the exploitation of the ReDoS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability and can trigger the vulnerability remotely. No user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in react-native versions 0.59.0 up to 0.62.3 and 0.63.0 up to 0.64.1.
*   The issue was addressed in versions 0.62.3 and 0.64.1 by updating the regular expression used in `validateBaseUrl` function.
* The fix was implemented in commit `ca09ae82715e33c9ac77b3fa55495cf84ba891c7`. The vulnerable regex was replaced with `^(?:(?:(?:https?|ftp):)?\/\/)(?:(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[01]\d|22[0-3])(?:\.(?:1?\d{1,2}|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2}(?:\.(?:[1-9]\d?|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-4]))|(?:(?:[a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff][a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff\_-]{0,62})?[a-z0-9\u00a1-\uffff]\.)\*(?:[a-z\u00a1-\uffff]{2,}\.?))(?::\d{2,5})?(?:[/?#]\S\*)?$`
