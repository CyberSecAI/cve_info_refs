- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol. Specifically, a decoding function may perform an out-of-bounds read when processing an incoming data packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities exist in the COPS protocol implementation within specific Huawei products.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can disrupt service on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to gain access to the affected network and send a crafted COPS data packet to trigger the vulnerability during decoding.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device and be able to send crafted network packets.
