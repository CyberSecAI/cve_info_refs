Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1750:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw in the `machine-config-operator` allows a container to consume a large amount of memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability: Specifically, excessive memory allocation by a container can cause the affected node to become unresponsive.
- Lack of proper resource management/limits for containers within the `machine-config-operator`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can make an OpenShift node unresponsive, preventing new pods from being scheduled on it.
- Reduced availability of the OpenShift cluster.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or compromised container deployed within the OpenShift cluster could trigger the vulnerability.
- An attacker could potentially deploy a specially crafted container designed to consume excessive memory, or exploit a vulnerable container.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to deploy or control a container within the OpenShift cluster.
- No specific privileges are mentioned beyond the ability to deploy a pod

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in `openshift/machine-config-operator` versions 4.4.3, 4.3.25, and 4.2.36.
