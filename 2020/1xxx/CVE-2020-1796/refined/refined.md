- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low privilege user can perform unauthorized operations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs physical access to the phone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have low-privilege access to the phone.
