      "cve": "CVE-2020-1714",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Keycloak's usage of ObjectInputStream without type checks leads to Remote Code Execution.",
      "root_cause": "The Keycloak code base uses `ObjectInputStream` without proper type checks, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary serialized Java objects.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization",
        "Lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can inject malicious serialized Java objects that will be deserialized in a privileged context, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "By injecting a malicious serialized Java object through a vulnerable component that deserializes data."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary serialized Java Objects into the application. This could be through a network endpoint or by other means depending on how the vulnerable component is exposed."
