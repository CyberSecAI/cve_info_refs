The provided content relates to CVE-2020-1731.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Keycloak operator (community only) generates a random admin password when installing Keycloak. However, the same password is generated every time Keycloak is deployed within the same OpenShift namespace.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Predictable admin password generation within the same OpenShift namespace.

**Impact of exploitation:**
If an attacker knows the predictable password generation mechanism, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to the Keycloak admin interface when deployed in an environment where they have visibility into the namespace.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with knowledge of the predictable password generation and access to the OpenShift namespace where Keycloak is being deployed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have knowledge of the predictable password generation mechanism in the Keycloak operator and access to the OpenShift namespace where Keycloak is being deployed. This access could mean the attacker has visibility to the namespace.
