Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1971:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents from Debian, Red Hat, FreeBSD, Siemens, and Tenable all directly mention CVE-2020-1971 and describe a vulnerability in the `GENERAL_NAME_cmp()` function within OpenSSL.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in the `GENERAL_NAME_cmp()` function within OpenSSL when comparing instances of the `GENERAL_NAME` type that contain `EDIPARTYNAME`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `GENERAL_NAME_cmp()` function, which leads to a crash.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who can control the input to the `GENERAL_NAME_cmp()` function can trigger a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) by causing the application to crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack can be triggered by a malicious peer during a TLS handshake if the server uses the `SSL_check_chain()` function.  Also an attacker could trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL, where automatic CRL downloading using URLs embedded in certificates makes this attack vector easier.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to control at least two `GENERAL_NAME` instances, both containing a malformed `EDIPARTYNAME`, that are subsequently compared using the vulnerable function. In scenarios involving TLS, the attacker would need to act as a malicious server during the handshake.
        * In cases of CRL checks, the attacker needs to supply a malicious certificate with a malicious CRL URL or control both the certificate and the CRL.
    * Some documents, notably the one from Tenable, specify this vulnerability occurs only if a server has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled.
    * The Siemens advisory also mentions that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME, but it is still possible to craft a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept, thus triggering the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The Debian LTS advisory DLA-2492-1 specifies the vulnerability is a "NULL dereference, resulting in denial of service."
*   The FreeBSD Security Advisory (FreeBSD-SA-20:33) further states "if an attacker can trick a client of server to check a maliciously constructed certificate against a malicious CRL could trigger the NULL dereference."
*   The Siemens security advisory mentions that all OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected. It also specifies that OpenSSL uses `GENERAL_NAME_cmp` for comparing CRL distribution point names and verifying timestamp authority names.
* The Oracle advisory describes the vulnerability as a "NULL pointer dereference leading to a possible denial of service attack".  It also mentions that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME, but "it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack.".
* The Tenable analysis states "If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result."

Based on the analysis, here's a summary in the format:

```
{
  "CVE": "CVE-2020-1971",
  "Root Cause": "Incorrect implementation in the GENERAL_NAME_cmp() function when handling EDIPARTYNAMEs.",
  "Vulnerabilities": [
    "NULL pointer dereference in GENERAL_NAME_cmp()"
  ],
  "Impact": "Denial of service due to application crash.",
  "Attack Vectors": [
      "Malicious TLS client during renegotiation ClientHello (if TLS v1.2 and renegotiation are enabled on server)",
      "Malicious certificate/CRL pair with malformed EDIPARTYNAME"
    ],
  "Required Capabilities": "Control over both items being compared with GENERAL_NAME_cmp(), which must be EDIPARTYNAME objects. If triggered via TLS, a malicious client is required."
