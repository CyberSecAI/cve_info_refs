- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the management server component of PAN-OS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can upload a corrupted PAN-OS configuration and potentially execute code with root privileges. This could allow complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. An attacker needs to be able to send the crafted PAN-OS configuration to the management server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload a PAN-OS configuration to the management server.
