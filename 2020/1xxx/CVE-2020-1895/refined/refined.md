- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer Overflow (CWE-680) leading to a Heap Overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A heap overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. The specific impact would depend on how the overflow is exploited.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading a specially crafted image with malicious dimensions via the Instagram Android application.
