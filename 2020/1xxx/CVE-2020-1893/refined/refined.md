Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1893:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient boundary checks when decoding JSON within the `TryParse` function of the HHVM JSON parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The lack of proper bounds checking allows the `TryParse` function to read memory beyond the allocated buffer when processing a specially crafted JSON string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By triggering an out-of-bounds read, an attacker can cause the HHVM process to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a malformed JSON string to a service using the vulnerable HHVM JSON parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send or provide a crafted JSON payload to be parsed by a vulnerable HHVM instance.
- No special privileges are required, the vulnerability can be triggered by anyone who can send a JSON request to HHVM application.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves modifying the parser to correctly handle cases where the entire input string has been consumed to prevent the out-of-bounds read.
- The commit message on GitHub also mentions a case where, in the failure case, the parser might have already consumed the entire string, likely explaining how the out-of-bounds read occurs.
