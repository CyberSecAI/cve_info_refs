Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1991

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure handling of temporary files within Palo Alto Networks Traps on Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure temporary file handling, specifically a vulnerability related to how Traps creates or manages temporary files. This could lead to the potential for overwriting system files or privilege escalation.
- The specific nature of the insecure temporary file usage is not described further.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, authenticated user can escalate their privileges to a higher level, potentially gaining full control of the affected system.
- **System File Overwrite:** The vulnerability could be used to overwrite critical system files, leading to system instability or complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack must originate from a local user on the same machine where Traps is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system (i.e., have valid login credentials).
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker can be a user with relatively low privileges.
