```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The JBoss EAP server does not properly parse the header field-name in accordance with RFC7230. It incorrectly processes whitespace between the header field-name and the colon.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper parsing of HTTP header field-names, specifically not rejecting requests that have whitespace between the header field-name and the colon.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The server returns an HTTP response code of 200 instead of the correct 400 (Bad Request) for malformed HTTP headers. This behavior might be exploitable for other attacks (not specified).",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a header with whitespace between the field-name and the colon.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable JBoss EAP server."
