- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software doesn't correctly process data in some abnormal cases.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper data processing leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause new connections to fail to establish. This leads to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the device network can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
