Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-1733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary directories by Ansible when using the `become_user` functionality.
- Ansible creates a temporary directory for the `become_user` with `umask 077` in `/var/tmp` without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:**  The core issue is a race condition. Ansible uses `umask 77 && mkdir -p <dir>` to create the temporary directory. This operation does not fail if the directory already exists and is owned by another user.
- **Insecure Directory Creation:**  Ansible does not validate if the directory already exists or if it has the expected permissions before creating it, leading to a potential time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability.
- **Predictable Path:** The temporary directory path can be retrieved by iterating through `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, making it easier for an attacker to target the directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain control of the `become_user` if they can create the directory before Ansible does or modify an existing directory. This effectively allows an unprivileged user to execute commands with the privileges of the `become_user`.
- **Modification of File Permissions:** An attacker can potentially modify the permissions of files owned by the original SSH user on the node if the attacker controls the created directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the target system where Ansible is being used.
- **Race Condition:** The attacker exploits a race condition during the temporary directory creation process by another user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must have an existing user account on the target system.
- **Timing Control:** The attacker must be able to execute commands in a timely manner to win the race condition.
- **Access to `/proc`:** The attacker needs access to the `/proc` filesystem to find the process ID and identify the temporary directory path.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Ansible versions prior to 2.7.17, 2.8.11, and 2.9.7
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding checks for existing directories and their permissions.
- Mounting the proc filesystem with `hidepid=2` is a potential mitigation to make it harder to extract the temporary directory path.
