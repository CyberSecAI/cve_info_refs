Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-1998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper authorization in PAN-OS. When a username is used for both a local Linux user and a SAML-enabled user, the system mistakenly uses the permissions of the local Linux user instead of the intended SAML permissions during Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The system fails to properly distinguish between local and SAML-based user permissions when the usernames are identical. This is a classic case of incorrect access control implementation.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The improper authorization can lead to authentication bypass, as the user is granted access based on the local user's permissions, which may be more privileged than their intended SAML-based permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unintended Resource Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to resources they are not supposed to access based on their SAML permissions.
- **Confidentiality Impact (Low):** An attacker might be able to access some confidential information due to the unauthorized access.
- **Integrity Impact (Low):** An attacker might be able to modify some data due to the unauthorized access
- **Availability Impact (None):** The vulnerability doesn't directly cause a denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for both a local Linux user account and a SAML-based account, where both accounts share the same username.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit given a shared username.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attack doesn't need any actions from the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects PAN-OS versions:
    - 7.1 prior to 7.1.26
    - 8.1 prior to 8.1.13
    - 9.0 prior to 9.0.6
    - 9.1 prior to 9.1.1
    - All 8.0 versions
- The vulnerability is classified as **Medium** severity with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.4
- The vulnerability is tracked under PAN-108992
- The vulnerability was discovered externally.
- Mitigation can be done by removing shared usernames between local Linux users and SAML-enabled users.
