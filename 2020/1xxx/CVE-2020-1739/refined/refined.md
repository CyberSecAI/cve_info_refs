Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-1739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Ansible `subversion` module handles passwords. When a password is provided using the `password` parameter within an Ansible task using the `svn` module, Ansible passes this password directly as a command-line argument to the `svn` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  Command line arguments are often visible to other users on the system through the `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` file system on Linux, allowing for potential credential disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker with local access to the managed machine can potentially read the password used by the ansible process. This could lead to unauthorized access to the Subversion repository and potentially to further compromise of systems or data if the credentials have wider access

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Local Access: The attacker must have the ability to access the managed node and view process information (e.g., through the `/proc` filesystem).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to access the managed system, i.e., be a local user.
-   The attacker needs to be able to read process information.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability specifically affects the `subversion` module in Ansible where the password is provided using the `password` argument.
-   The suggested mitigation is to use a different way to provide the password such as via stdin rather than a command line parameter.
-   The vulnerability has been addressed in Ansible versions 2.7.17, 2.8.11 and 2.9.7.
-   The vulnerability has been assigned a low severity score in both the Red Hat and Github advisory databases, because it requires local access on a compromised host.
