### Description

A format string vulnerability in the PAN-OS log daemon (logd) on Panorama allows a network based attacker with knowledge of registered firewall devices and access to Panorama management interfaces to execute arbitrary code, bypassing the restricted shell and escalating privileges.

This issue affects only PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.13 on Panorama.

This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1, PAN-OS 9.0, or later PAN-OS versions.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | None | >= 9.1.0 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | None | >= 9.0.0 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.13 | >= 8.1.13 |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | None | >= 7.1.0 |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

### Weakness Type

[CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.13 and all later PAN-OS 8.1 versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue affects the management interface of Panorama and is mitigated by following best practices for securing the Panorama management interface. Our best practices guidelines reduce the exposure of the management interface to potential attackers. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS 8.1 technical documentation, available at: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/getting-started/best-practices-for-securing-administrative-access>.
