Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-1979:

**Root Cause:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS log daemon (logd) on Panorama.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String:** The `logd` daemon is vulnerable to format string injection, allowing an attacker to potentially control the format string used in logging, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a network-based attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Panorama system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation bypasses the restricted shell and escalates the attacker's privileges to root level.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** High impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Panorama Management Interfaces:** The attacker must have access to the Panorama management interfaces.
- **Knowledge of Registered Firewall Devices:** The attacker needs knowledge of registered firewall devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Requires network connectivity to the Panorama management interface.
- **Knowledge of Registered Devices:** The attacker needs awareness of the firewalls registered with the Panorama instance.
- **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior privileges on the system.

**Affected Versions:**
- PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.13 on Panorama

**Unaffected Versions:**
- PAN-OS 7.1, PAN-OS 9.0, and later versions
- PAN-OS 8.1.13 and later 8.1 versions
