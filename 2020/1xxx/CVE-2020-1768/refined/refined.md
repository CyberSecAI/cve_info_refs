Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The external frontend of OTRS makes numerous background calls to the backend to fetch data and check for updates. These background requests were incorrectly treated as user activity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session Expiration Bypass: Background requests incorrectly extended the user's session, preventing it from expiring based on the configured `SessionMaxIdleTime`. This meant a user's session could remain active indefinitely even without actual user interaction.
- Incorrect Session Handling: The system failed to distinguish between actual user activity and background requests, leading to flawed session management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Extended Session Duration: An attacker could potentially maintain an active session indefinitely without needing to re-authenticate. This increased the window of opportunity for malicious activities.
- Session Hijacking Potential: If an attacker gained access to an active, non-expiring session (e.g., through stolen credentials), they could potentially maintain access to the system for a longer time.
- Resource Consumption: The continued background requests might consume system resources without a user actively using the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Keeping a Browser Session Open: Simply keeping an OTRS application open in a browser would prevent session expiration, because background requests will be sent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to a valid user account: The attacker needs to have credentials or access to an existing user's session.
- No special privileges needed: The attacker can be a regular user, and no special access is required to leverage this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affected OTRS 7.0.x versions up to 7.0.14.
- The issue was resolved in OTRS 7.0.15.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 5.4, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
