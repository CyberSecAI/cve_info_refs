  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the alternative subflow in the reset credential flow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the reset credential flow and manipulate the subflow to bypass authentication."
