Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-1938:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2020-1938 lies in the way Apache Tomcat handles incoming connections via the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP). Tomcat treats AJP connections with a higher level of trust than other connections, such as HTTP. This trust, combined with the AJP Connector being enabled by default and listening on all configured IP addresses, creates an opportunity for attackers if they can access this AJP port.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **File Read/Inclusion:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the AJP vulnerability to read arbitrary files from anywhere within the web application.
2.  **JSP Processing:** Attackers can also use the vulnerability to process any file within the web application as a JavaServer Pages (JSP) file.
3. **Unsafe defaults:** The AJP connector was enabled by default with no authentication, allowing access to untrusted users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read configuration files and source code files of web applications deployed on the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the file read/inclusion vulnerability with the ability to process files as JSP, attackers can upload malicious code (e.g., within a file), include it with the AJP vulnerability, and gain remote code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As noted in the SUSE information, exploitation can result in a DoS.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through network access to the AJP Connector port. The content also mentions that this port listens on all configured IP addresses by default which opens up a larger attack surface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access** : The attacker needs to have network access to the AJP port of the vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   **Unauthenticated:** Exploitation can be done by remote, unauthenticated attackers.
*   **File Upload (For RCE):** If the attacker intends to achieve remote code execution they will require the ability to upload files to the vulnerable server. This can occur through a file upload feature in the application, or if they can somehow control the content of the web application.

**Additional Technical Details and Context:**

*   **AJP Connector:** The AJP Connector uses the AJP protocol, which is a performance-optimized binary version of the HTTP protocol.
*   **"Ghostcat" Nickname**: The vulnerability is referred to as "Ghostcat" due to it affecting all Tomcat versions with the AJP connector enabled, with the issue having been present for more than a decade.
*  **Configuration changes:** The update does not enforce the recommended upstream configuration changes (such as setting 'secretRequired' to true), and this is intentionally done to avoid breaking existing installations, making it essential that administrators review their AJP Connector configurations manually.

The information found in the content provides more detail on the exploitation and mitigation than what is present in the official CVE description. Specifically, it elaborates on the AJP connector's role, the specific nature of the vulnerability (file read/inclusion + JSP processing), the requirement of file uploads for RCE, and the configuration changes required to fully mitigate the issue. It also specifies the versions affected.
