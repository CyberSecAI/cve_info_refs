Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `unserialize()` function in HHVM incorrectly supported the type code 'S'. This type code was intended for use only during APC (Alternative PHP Cache) serialization. When used outside of APC, it allowed the function to interpret arbitrary memory addresses as if they were pointers to static StringData objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Access:** By crafting a malicious serialized string with the 'S' type code, an attacker could force the `unserialize()` function to dereference a provided memory address.
- **Type Confusion:** The `unserialize()` function incorrectly handles the 'S' type code, leading to type confusion by treating an arbitrary memory address as a valid string object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Read:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary memory locations within the HHVM process, which could lead to information disclosure of sensitive data.
- **Crash:** Accessing invalid memory locations can also lead to a crash of the HHVM process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted serialized string to the `unserialize()` function containing the 'S' type code and a malicious memory address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to an application that uses the vulnerable `unserialize()` function in HHVM, without relying on APC serialization.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, implying that the attacker can be a regular user able to pass data to the function.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in HHVM versions 4.32.3, 4.56.1, 4.57.1, 4.58.2, 4.59.1, 4.60.1, 4.61.1, 4.62.1, and 4.64.0.
- The provided commit ([facebook/hhvm@1107228](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/1107228a5128d3ca1c4add8ac1635d933cbbe2e9)) shows the fix, which restricts the recognition of type 'S' to only when the serializer is in APC mode.

This vulnerability is classified as high severity, due to the potential for arbitrary memory access.
