Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11. Specifically, the `corsAllowedOrigin` setting within `master-config.yaml` was configured in a way that allowed for protocol downgrade, enabling an attacker to potentially bypass intended security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Overly permissive CORS:** The `corsAllowedOrigin` configuration was not strict enough. It used a pattern that allowed an attacker to change the protocol (e.g., from `https` to `http`) when making cross-origin requests.
- **Regex vulnerability:**  The vulnerable configuration used the regex `(?i)//my\.subdomain\.domain\.com(:|\z)`, which is too lenient. It allows for matching with different protocols than the intended one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could exploit this vulnerability to perform phishing attacks. They could potentially redirect a user's browser to a malicious page by leveraging the overly permissive CORS configuration.
- **Data Confidentiality:** The main threat is a breach of data confidentiality. An attacker might be able to steal sensitive data or credentials if the user interacts with the malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker needs to intercept the connection between the user's browser and the OpenShift console.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MitM position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the user's browser and the OpenShift console.
- **Basic Knowledge of CORS:** Understanding of how CORS works and the implications of a poorly configured `corsAllowedOrigin` setting is required.

**Mitigation:**
The recommended mitigation involves changing the `corsAllowedOrigin` definition to include a stricter pattern that enforces protocol matching. The suggested fix is to use the regex `^(?i)<https://my\.subdomain\.domain\.com(:|\z>)` to ensure that cross-origin requests only succeed if the host and protocol match.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 via RHSA-2020:3541.
- The documentation was updated to reflect the proper configuration of `corsAllowedOrigin`.
