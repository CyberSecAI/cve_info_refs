- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unquoted search path vulnerability in the Windows release of GlobalProtect App.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The GlobalProtect App on Windows has an unquoted search path vulnerability. This means that when the application attempts to execute a program or load a library, the search path for that program or library is not enclosed in quotation marks. This can lead to an attacker injecting a malicious program/library in a location that is searched before the intended path and the system executes that instead.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with file creation privileges on the root of the OS disk (C:\) or Program Files directory can gain system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have file creation privileges on either C:\ or 'Program Files'.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user with file creation privileges on the root of the OS disk (C:\) or 'Program Files' directory.
