These vulnerabilities are due to improper enforcement of administrator privilege levels for sensitive data. An attacker with read-only administrator access to the Admin portal could exploit these vulnerabilities by browsing to one of the pages that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information regarding the configuration of the system.  For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-info-exp-8RsuEu8S>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected the following Cisco ISE releases:    + 2.3 Patch7 and earlier   + 2.4 Patch13 and earlier   + 2.6 Patch8 and earlier   + 2.7 Patch2 and earlier   + 3.0 Patch1 and earlier See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco ISE releases:    + 2.0   + 2.0.1   + 2.1   + 2.2  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2021-1412: Cisco Identity Services Engine Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Admin portal of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.  This vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of administrator privilege levels for high-value sensitive data. An attacker with read-only administrator access to the Admin portal could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to the page that contains the sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information regarding the configuration of the system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvw82927](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw82927), [CSCvw81454](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw81454), [CSCvw89818](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw89818)CVE ID: CVE-2021-1412Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2021-1416: Cisco Identity Services Engine Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Admin portal of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.  This vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of administrator privilege levels for low-value sensitive data. An attacker with read-only administrator access to the Admin portal could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to the page that contains the sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information regarding the configuration of the system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
