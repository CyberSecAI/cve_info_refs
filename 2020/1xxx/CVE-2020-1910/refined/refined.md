- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing bounds check in image filter processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read and write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially other impacts due to out-of-bounds read and write by sending a specially crafted image.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted image to a user, then having the user apply specific image filters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the victim. The user must also apply specific filters to the crafted image.
