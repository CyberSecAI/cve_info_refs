- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of a parameter when initializing a driver program, leading to data being written beyond the intended buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could cause the device to reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking a user into installing a malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and convince a user to install a malicious application on a vulnerable device. The attacker also needs high privileges on the targeted device (PR:H). The user interaction is also required (UI:R).
