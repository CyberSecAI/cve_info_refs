# Configuring the Internal Management IP Address of vSRX VNF

VNF internal management IP addresses (192.168.x.x) on
the default network (virbr0 bridge) are assigned through DHCP, and
/etc/hosts updates handled automatically.

**Note**

You can log on to the vSRX VNF through SSH only after
configuring DHCP on the fxp0 interface so that the internal management
IP address is set on the fxp0 interface.

To configure the internal management IP address on the
fxp0 interface of vSRX VNF.:

1. Verify if the vSRX VNF is successfully created.root@jdm# `/var/third-party# virsh list`
   ```
   Id    Name                           State
   ----------------------------------------------------
   2     vjunos0                        running
   3     vsrx                           running

   ```

   You can see that the vSRX VM is running.
2. Log on to the vSRX VNF console. root@jdm# `~# virsh console vsrx`
   ```
   login:
   ```
   **Note**
   * Ensure that the escape character is not as same as the
     character used for any other purpose in the vSRX console.
   * You can use this virsh console to log on to the console
     of any VM for troubleshooting, if other login methods fail.
3. Log in as `root`.
4. Enter the configuration mode.root@user-vsrx>`configure`
5. Change the default vSRX root password after you log in
   to the console:[edit]root@user-vsrx# `set system root-authentication password`
6. Enable DHCP on fxp0 interface and commit the configuration.[edit]root@user-vsrx# `set interfaces fxp0 unit 0
   family inet dhcp`[edit]root@user-vsrx# `commit`
7. Use the character # to return to the JDM CLI.
8. Verify if fxp0 interface is up. root@jdm>`show virtual-network-functions`
   ```
   ID       Name                    State             Liveliness
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   2        vjunos0                 running           alive
   3        vsrx                    running           alive
   9192     jdm                     running           alive

   ```

   The status alive indicates that
   the IP address has been assigned successfully.

   You can now establish an SSH connection to the vSRX VNF by running
   the `ssh vsrx` command.
