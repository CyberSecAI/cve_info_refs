- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of malformed packets with specific parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability, insufficient packet validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation can lead to a process reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker crafts malformed packets with specific parameters and sends them to the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device to send malicious packets.
