Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap use-after-free error in systemd's handling of asynchronous Polkit queries related to D-Bus messages. Specifically, the `bus_verify_polkit_async()` function uses a cache to store objects, which are cleared when the bus becomes idle. When a D-Bus method utilizes `bus_verify_polkit_async()`, the method's handler might be invoked after a delay while waiting for Polkit authorization. If the Polkit request takes too long, the cache might be cleared and the stored objects freed before the method handler is called again, leading to a use-after-free condition when the handler tries to access the freed userdata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory is accessed after it has been freed. This occurs because of the asynchronous nature of Polkit queries and the way systemd manages cached objects related to D-Bus methods.
- **Improper Cache Management:** The cache mechanism used by certain D-Bus interfaces doesn't account for the potential delay introduced by asynchronous operations, particularly Polkit requests. This results in the cache being cleared prematurely.
- **Lack of proper synchronization/locking:** There is no synchronization around accessing the cached objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Systemd Service Crash:** An attacker can trigger the use-after-free condition, leading to crashes of systemd services.
- **Potential Code Execution:** The vulnerability can potentially be exploited for code execution and privilege escalation. This would allow a local unprivileged attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Unprivileged Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local unprivileged attacker.
- **Specially Crafted D-Bus Messages:** The attacker needs to send specially crafted D-Bus messages to trigger the vulnerability. These messages would initiate D-Bus methods that use asynchronous Polkit requests.
- The `org.freedesktop.machine1.Image` interface was specifically mentioned as vulnerable, which is accessible by all users and has a vulnerable method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **D-Bus Interaction:** The attacker must be able to send D-Bus messages to the affected systemd services.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable methods:** The attacker would need to know how to craft D-Bus messages that trigger specific methods vulnerable to the use-after-free, for example `org.freedesktop.machine1.Image.Clone` which performs asynchronous polkit queries.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero.
- The fix involves modifying how the `bus_verify_polkit_async()` function works, specifically by re-resolving the callback and userdata instead of caching them. This ensures that the userdata is always up-to-date and valid before the method handler is invoked the second time after the asynchronous Polkit request completes.
- The upstream fix was included in systemd version v245-rc1.
- Several commits were involved in fixing the vulnerability:
  - `1068447`: Introduces API for re-enqueuing incoming messages (`sd_bus_enqueue_for_read`).
  - `6374862`: Fixes polkit to re-resolve callback/userdata instead of caching it.
  - `bc130b6`: Fixes a typo in the function name.
  - `ea0d0ed`: Merges the polkit fix branch.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 was not directly affected by the vulnerability because the systemd version shipped with it did not have any service using `bus_verify_polkit_async()` in a way that would trigger the use-after-free. However, the vulnerable code was present in the function.
- The systemd-machined service was identified as being vulnerable.
