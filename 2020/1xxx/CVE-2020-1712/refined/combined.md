Message-ID: <20200205095955.GI121861@fedorawork>

Subject: CVE-2020-1712 systemd: use-after-free when asynchronous polkit
 queries are performed

Hello,

A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd, when asynchronous
Polkit queries are performed while handling Dbus messages. A local unprivileged
attacker can abuse this flaw to crash systemd services or potentially execute
code and elevate their privileges, by sending specially crafted Dbus messages.

CVE-2020-1712 has been assigned to this issue.

This flaw happens due to the way bus_verify_polkit_async() works. Some DBus
interfaces use a cache to store objects for a short period and they clear it as
soon as the bus is again in the idle state. However, if a DBus method uses
bus_verify_polkit_async(), the method may have to wait a while until the polkit
action is resolved and when that happens the method handler is called again,
with the userdata previously allocated. If the polkit request takes too long,
the clearing of the cache would free the stored objects before the method is
called the second time, causing the use-after-free vulnerability.

The issue was reported by Tavis Ormandy, Google Project Zero.

Upstream fix is included in v245-rc1:
<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/ea0d0ede03c6f18dbc5036c5e9cccf97e415ccc2>

…stead of caching it

Previously, when doing an async PK query we'd store the original
callback/userdata pair and call it again after the PK request is
complete. This is problematic, since PK queries might be slow and in the
meantime the userdata might be released and re-acquired. Let's avoid
this by always traversing through the message handlers so that we always
re-resolve the callback and userdata pair and thus can be sure it's
up-to-date and properly valid.

Package        : systemd
Version        : 232-25+deb9u14
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-1712
Debian Bug     : 950732

A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd, a system and
service manager, where asynchronous Polkit queries are performed while
handling dbus messages. A local unprivileged attacker can abuse this
flaw to crash systemd services or potentially execute code and elevate
their privileges, by sending specially crafted dbus messages.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
232-25+deb9u14.

We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.

For the detailed security status of systemd please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/systemd>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-23 20:55:51 UTC  ``` systemd contains a heap use-after-free vulnerability due to the way asynchronous polkit queries are performed. The userdata that needs to be passed to the polkit callback is cached in the AsyncPolkitQuery structure, however when the callback is actually called, the object the userdata is pointing to may already have been released and re-used for other purposes. Local unprivileged attackers may abuse this flaw to crash systemd services or potentially execute code and elevate their privileges.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-27 12:08:55 UTC  ``` This bug happens due to the way bus_verify_polkit_async() works. Some DBus interfaces use a cache to store objects for a short period and they clear it as soon as the bus is again in the idle state. However, if a DBus method uses an async function like bus_verify_polkit_async(), the method may have to wait a while until the polkit action is resolved and when that happens the DBus method is called again, with the userdata previously allocated. If the polkit requests takes a bit too long, the clearing of the cache would free the stored objects before the method is called the second time, causing the use-after-free vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-27 16:21:58 UTC  ``` At least systemd-machined service exposes a DBus API that is vulnerable to this flaw, because of the way Images are temporarily stored in a cache and because of some DBus methods like org.freedesktop.machine1.Image.Clone that performs asynchronous polkit queries which may trigger the use-after-free. The attack can be done by any unprivileged user as the interface org.freedesktop.machine1.Image is accessible by everybody.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-27 16:33:45 UTC  ``` Usage of polkit to open up machined's commands to unprivileged user was done in upstream commit <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/70244d1d25eb80b57e160ea004d0e6bf793d4caf> . This commit was first included in systemd v220.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c10)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-27 17:00:05 UTC  ``` Vulnerable DBus methods have: 1) a "find" function for the associated object (e.g. image_object_find) that configures a temporary cache and setups a "defer_event" which frees the elements in the cache 2) a call to bus_verify_polkit_async() in the handler of the method (e.g. bus_image_method_clone) 3) SD_BUS_VTABLE_UNPRIVILEGED as one of the specified flags   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-27 17:01:17 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Tavis Ormandy (Google Project Zero)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c15)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-03 09:45:56 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as there is no service that performs asynchronous polkit requests in a vulnerable way.  The version of systemd delivered in OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 and included in CoreOS images has been superseded by the version delivered in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. CoreOS updates for systemd in will be consumed from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 channels.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c16)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-03 09:50:55 UTC  ``` Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ships systemd v219, which does not have any service that uses bus_verify_polkit_async() while holding a temporary cache that is freed during a "defer_event". However, function bus_verify_polkit_async() does contain the vulnerable code even though the flaw is not reachable.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c18)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-05 09:37:00 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/ea0d0ede03c6f18dbc5036c5e9cccf97e415ccc2>  In particular, the following commits prevent the flaw: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/1068447e6954dc6ce52f099ed174c442cb89ed54> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/637486261528e8aa3da9f26a4487dc254f4b7abb> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/bc130b6858327b382b07b3985cf48e2aa9016b2d>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c19)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-05 10:01:26 UTC  ``` Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1798414](show_bug.cgi?id=1798414 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1712 systemd: use-after-free when asynchronous polkit queries are performed [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-02-20 22:07:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2020:0564 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0564](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0564)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1794578#c22)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-02-21 03:49:47 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

|  |  | the local read queue, so that it is processed and dispatched locally again, similar to how an incoming |

sd-bus: introduce API for re-enqueuing incoming messages

```
When authorizing via PolicyKit we want to process incoming method calls
twice: once to process and figure out that we need PK authentication,
and a second time after we aquired PK authentication to actually execute
the operation. With this new call sd_bus_enqueue_for_read() we have a
way to put an incoming message back into the read queue for this
purpose.

This might have other uses too, for example debugging.
