- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of messages before updating the conversation overview.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into messages, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the conversation overview. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to send a message containing the malicious script. When the conversation overview is updated, the script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be a user able to send messages in the Moodle platform.
