Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-1894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A stack write overflow occurs when processing push-to-talk messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** A specially crafted push-to-talk message can cause a write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack. This indicates a lack of proper bounds checking on the size of data being written to the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected WhatsApp application. This could lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted push-to-talk message:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user receives and plays a specially crafted push-to-talk message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted push-to-talk message to the victim. This could potentially be achieved if the attacker is in the contact list of the victim or is in a group with the victim.

**Affected Versions:**

*   WhatsApp for Android prior to v2.20.35
*   WhatsApp Business for Android prior to v2.20.20
*   WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.20.30
*   WhatsApp Business for iOS prior to v2.20.30

**Additional Notes**

*   The description explicitly mentions a *stack write* overflow, confirming it is a stack-based buffer overflow, a type of memory corruption vulnerability.
*   The impact is severe, leading to *arbitrary code execution*, allowing a remote attacker to take full control of the app and possibly the underlying device.
*   This vulnerability is present across both Android and iOS platforms in both the regular and business versions of the application.
