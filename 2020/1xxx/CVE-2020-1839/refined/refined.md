The provided content is related to CVE-2020-1839.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists where certain pointer members can be modified by another process operating concurrently. This occurs due to a timing window that allows for unintended modification of shared data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition vulnerability.
- Insufficient synchronization mechanism between processes that share memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the race condition vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack via a crafted application.
- The attacker must trick the user into running a crafted application with high privileges.
- The attacker must also win the race condition for the exploitation to succeed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and run a crafted application with high privileges on the target device.
- Must be able to trick the user into running the malicious app.
- Needs to be able to execute code to trigger and win the race condition during the vulnerable timing window.
