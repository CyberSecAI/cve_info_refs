Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `atomic_move` primitive in Ansible's file handling logic lacks the ability to specify file permissions when creating new files during a move operation. It defaults to using `0666` (read/write for everyone) and then applies the system's `umask`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Default Permissions:** When a new file is created during an atomic move, the default permission applied is 0666 which could lead to world readable files depending on the umask setting of the system.
- **Race Condition:** There's a brief period where the newly created file exists with the default permissions before the final mode is applied if a specific mode is specified in the task.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive data within a newly created file might be exposed due to overly permissive file permissions.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, they may be able to use this information to gain further access to systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Ansible playbooks that utilize the `atomic_move` primitive to create or move files. An attacker could create or modify Ansible playbooks to exploit this vulnerability
- Any Ansible tasks that perform file moves where the destination does not exist or the task is not carefully constructed, using `mode=preserve` or explicitly setting the `mode` parameter to the desired permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control or modify Ansible playbooks or tasks.
- A user with access to use an Ansible playbook which performs the vulnerable operation, where a new file will be created using atomic\_move, with the default permissions

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Ansible versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches and earlier.
- The fix was attempted but later removed as it caused more issues, and products are no longer applying fixes for this low severity CVE.
- Mitigation involves specifying the "mode" in the task or use `mode=preserve` to maintain the original file permissions. However, using a specific mode will still have a race condition issue if a new file is created.
