| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-12 12:18:19 UTC  ``` The atomic_move primitive is lacking moving files with a mode. This sets the destination files world-readable if the destination file does not exist and if the file exists could become with less restricted permissions before the move. This could lead in disclosing sensitive data.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c2)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-17 12:56:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Damien Aumaitre (Quarkslab), Nicolas Surbayrole (Quarkslab)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c4)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-02-19 07:22:48 UTC  ``` Any upstream reference for the issue available?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c5)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-20 16:47:50 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1805332](show_bug.cgi?id=1805332 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1736 ansible: atomic_move primitive sets permissive permissions [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1805331](show_bug.cgi?id=1805331 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1736 ansible: atomic_move primitive sets permissive permissions [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c6)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-20 17:02:17 UTC  ``` Hey Salvatore, I am working to provide additional information regarding this issue; more details as you requested, affected versions as well as upstream links in case we already have. Prioritising this for now, I will get back to you asap.  In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c4): > Any upstream reference for the issue available?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c9)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-02-20 22:44:52 UTC  ``` Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.9 is in maintenance phase and we're no longer fixing "Low" severity CVEs.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c13)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-27 10:24:11 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67794>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c14)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-27 12:19:30 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1807876](show_bug.cgi?id=1807876 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-1736 ansible: atomic_move primitive sets permissive permissions [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c16)  Hardik Vyas    2020-03-18 16:13:02 UTC  ``` Red Hat Gluster Storage and Red Hat Ceph Storage no longer maintains its own version of Ansible. The fix will be provided from core Ansible. But we still ship ansible separately for ceph ubuntu.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c19)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-05-11 09:40:43 UTC  ``` CloudForms 5.11 do not use ansible-tower and 5.10 only using ansible-tower-venv-ansible atm. Closing this tracker.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c24)  Borja Tarraso    2020-08-20 07:19:27 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This issue can be mitigated by specifying the "mode" on the task. That just leaves a race condition in place where newly created files that specify a mode in the task briefly go from 666 - umask to the final mode. An alternative workaround if many new files are created and to avoid setting a specific mode for each file would be to set the "mode" to "preserve" value. That will maintain the permissions of the source file on the controller in the final file on the managed host.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c29)  Summer Long    2021-01-14 04:58:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  Ansible Engine 2.8.14 and 2.9.12 as well as previous versions and all 2.7.x versions are affected.  Ansible Tower 3.6.5 and 3.7.2 as well as previous versions are affected.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1802124#c42)  Matt Davis    2021-10-12 23:27:37 UTC  ``` Attempts were made to address this but ultimately removed as they caused more problems than they solved. Closing, as the products in question are no longer applying fixes for low severity CVEs.   ``` |  |

## Description

A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when a file is moved using atomic\_move primitive as the file mode cannot be specified. This sets the destination files world-readable if the destination file does not exist and if the file exists, the file could be changed to have less restrictive permissions before the move. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data. All versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 33 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [BINUTILS235](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS235 "Changes/BINUTILS235")
* [CMake to do out-of-source builds](/wiki/Changes/CMake_to_do_out-of-source_builds "Changes/CMake to do out-of-source builds")
* [Aarch64 PointerAuthentication](/wiki/Changes/Aarch64_PointerAuthentication "Changes/Aarch64 PointerAuthentication")
* [Java11](/wiki/Changes/Java11 "Changes/Java11")
* [Sqlite Rpmdb](/wiki/Changes/Sqlite_Rpmdb "Changes/Sqlite Rpmdb")
* [RPM 4.16](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.16 "Changes/RPM-4.16")
* [F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 22nd. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f33
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f33. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f33 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f33
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-27 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

## Description

##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2020-1736](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x7jh-595q-wq82 "CVE-2020-1736")

If a file doesn't exist, we create it with `0666` permissions combined with the current `umask`. Depending on the default umask as well as the permissions on the destination directory, this could result in world readable files.

**Relevant code:**

Default permissions:

[ansible/lib/ansible/module\_utils/common/file.py](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/79dfae9624480f757795224732bfaa9ca1dd4543/lib/ansible/module_utils/common/file.py#L60-L62)

Lines 60 to 62
in
[79dfae9](/ansible/ansible/commit/79dfae9624480f757795224732bfaa9ca1dd4543)

|  | \_PERM\_BITS = 0o7777 # file mode permission bits |
| --- | --- |
|  | \_EXEC\_PERM\_BITS = 0o0111 # execute permission bits |
|  | \_DEFAULT\_PERM = 0o0666 # default file permission bits |

creation in `atomic_move`:

[ansible/lib/ansible/module\_utils/basic.py](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/79dfae9624480f757795224732bfaa9ca1dd4543/lib/ansible/module_utils/basic.py#L2296-L2303)

| --- | --- |
|  | # make sure the file has the correct permissions |
|  | # based on the current value of umask |
|  | umask = os.umask(0) |
|  | os.umask(umask) |
|  | os.chmod(b\_dest, DEFAULT\_PERM & ~umask) |
|  | try: |
|  | os.chown(b\_dest, os.geteuid(), os.getegid()) |

```
if creating:
    # make sure the file has the correct permissions
    # based on the current value of umask
    umask = os.umask(0)
    os.umask(umask)
    os.chmod(b_dest, DEFAULT_PERM & ~umask)
    try:
        os.chown(b_dest, os.geteuid(), os.getegid())
    except OSError:
        # We're okay with trying our best here.  If the user is not
        # root (or old Unices) they won't be able to chown.
        pass
```

Suggested correction is to use more restrictive permissions by default and/or add a mechanism to prevent creating world readable files.

##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2020-1736](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x7jh-595q-wq82 "CVE-2020-1736")

If a file doesn't exist, we create it with `0666` permissions combined with the current `umask`. Depending on the default umask as well as the permissions on the destination directory, this could result in world readable files.

**Relevant code:**

Default permissions:

[ansible/lib/ansible/module\_utils/common/file.py](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/79dfae9624480f757795224732bfaa9ca1dd4543/lib/ansible/module_utils/common/file.py#L60-L62)

if creating:
    # make sure the file has the correct permissions
    # based on the current value of umask
    umask = os.umask(0)
    os.umask(umask)
    os.chmod(b_dest, DEFAULT_PERM & ~umask)
    try:
        os.chown(b_dest, os.geteuid(), os.getegid())
    except OSError:
        # We're okay with trying our best here.  If the user is not
        # root (or old Unices) they won't be able to chown.
        pass
```

Suggested correction is to use more restrictive permissions by default and/or add a mechanism to prevent creating world readable files.
