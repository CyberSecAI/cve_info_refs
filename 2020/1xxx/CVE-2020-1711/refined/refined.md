Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-1711:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds heap buffer access vulnerability exists in the iSCSI block driver of QEMU. This is triggered when processing a response from an iSCSI server while checking the status of a Logical Address Block (LBA) using the `iscsi_co_block_status()` routine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds heap buffer access:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the number of blocks returned by the iSCSI server. The code does not properly check if the response contains more blocks than the allocated memory, leading to a heap overflow.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** QEMU fails to validate the number of blocks reported by the server in the iSCSI response.
- **Memory Management Issue:**  Incorrect handling of memory allocation/deallocation when processing iSCSI responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** A remote attacker controlling the iSCSI server could send a crafted response that causes a heap overflow, leading to the QEMU process crashing.
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  More seriously, a carefully crafted iSCSI response could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the heap with malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** An attacker with control over an iSCSI server can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious response to a QEMU client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Control over the iSCSI server:** The attacker needs to be in control of the iSCSI server that the vulnerable QEMU instance is connecting to.
- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable QEMU instance.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `iscsi_co_block_status()` function.
- The issue occurs when processing the response to a "GET LBA STATUS" command.
- The number of blocks returned by the server can exceed the space allocated for them by QEMU, causing a heap buffer overflow when QEMU tries to write the block status to the `allocmap`.
- The vulnerability is due to the misuse of `snprintf` and is in libslirp, specifically the `tcp_subr.c` file in version 4.1.0

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch caps the number of blocks that the function attempts to update, preventing an overflow of the bitmap
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Red Hat, indicating the potential for significant security impact.
- The issue affects multiple SUSE products.
- A similar vulnerability also exists within tcp_emu().
- Patches are available to correct the overflow by limiting the number of blocks updated.

The provided information provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability, detailing its root cause, impact, attack vectors, required capabilities, and fixes. It should be noted that while the CVE description may be quite brief, the Red Hat advisories, mailing list discussions and bugzilla entries offer significant context.
