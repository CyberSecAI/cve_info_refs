Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-1985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Incorrect default permissions on the `C:\Programdata\Secdo\Logs` folder in Secdo for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default permissions on the specified log folder allowed local, authenticated users to write to and overwrite system files within that directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Escalated Privileges:** By exploiting the ability to overwrite system files, an attacker can gain escalated privileges on the system.
* **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The exploit has a high impact on all three, allowing the attacker to access, modify, and render the system unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Local Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a local authenticated user on the Windows system.
* **Low Privileges Required:** The exploit does not require elevated privileges to begin, meaning any low-privileged user can attempt the attack.
* **No User Interaction:** The exploit does not require any interaction from other users.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of Secdo for Windows.
* The product is no longer supported, and therefore a patch will not be released.
* A workaround involves manually changing the permissions on the vulnerable log folder to restrict access for unprivileged users.
