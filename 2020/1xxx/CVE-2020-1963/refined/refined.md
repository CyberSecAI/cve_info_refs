Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Apache Ignite uses the H2 database to build its SQL distributed execution engine.
*   The H2 database provides SQL functions that can be exploited to access the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File System Access:** The vulnerability lies in the ability of H2 SQL functions to interact with the underlying file system, allowing unauthorized read and write operations.
*   **Dependency Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability exists due to a vulnerable dependency (H2 database) used by Apache Ignite.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File System Read/Write:** An attacker can use embedded H2 SQL functions to read from and write to the filesystem. This can lead to data theft, data manipulation or potentially other malicious activities on the server where Ignite is deployed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker would need to inject malicious SQL queries that leverage the vulnerable H2 functions through the Apache Ignite SQL interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Ignite SQL Interface:** The attacker needs to be able to submit SQL queries to the Apache Ignite instance. This implies the attacker has some form of network access to the Ignite service or is able to directly interact with it if running on the same host.
*   **Understanding of H2 Functions:** The attacker must be aware of the specific H2 SQL functions that enable file system access.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade Apache Ignite:** Upgrade to version 2.8.1 or later, which addresses the vulnerability.
*  **Remove indexing component:** If SQL is not used, removing the `ignite-indexing.jar` from the classpath will mitigate the issue.
*   **Run as non-privileged user:** Running Apache Ignite with a non-privileged user can partially mitigate the risk by limiting the permissions available for file system access.
