Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-1696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the pki-core's Token Processing Service (TPS). Specifically, the Profile ID field within the TPS web interface was not properly sanitizing user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The Profile ID field, when adding a new profile, does not filter or sanitize specially crafted JavaScript input. This allows an attacker to store malicious JavaScript code within the application.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the Profile ID field before storing it, resulting in the ability to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can deface the web UI.
- **Information Disclosure:** Minor information disclosure, including user information such as name, email, and roles, is possible.
- **Limited Cookie Theft:** While cookie theft is possible, the impact is limited due to the web UI's use of client-side TLS authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the TPS web interface where a new profile is created.
- **Malicious Profile ID:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript within the profile ID input field.
- **Triggering the XSS:** The stored JavaScript payload is executed when the profile ID is printed, impacting users who view or interact with the affected section of the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Sufficient Permissions:** The attacker requires sufficient privileges to add or modify profiles within the TPS to be able to store the malicious payload.
- **Victim Interaction:** A victim with necessary authentication to the system would need to view the malicious profile or somehow trigger the rendering of the profile ID in the vulnerable UI for the javascript to execute.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed via a commit that addresses multiple XSS vulnerabilities in TPS: `https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/1dbb07f8e41b4809b0f41a7643c37301fcf712d8`
- The vulnerability affects "fedora-all".
- Red Hat provided fixes for this vulnerability via errata RHSA-2021:0947 and RHSA-2021:0948.
