| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2019-12-06 17:02:14 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Profile ID field while adding new profile at TPS's web page, when adding new profile (Profile ID) input field not getting filtered or sanitize the specially crafted javascript like <script>alert(document.domain)</script> and being stored/triggered everytime with domain name in response. This user input is not being sanitized and therefore it is vulnerable to a Stored XSS.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c1)  Cedric Buissart    2020-01-14 20:13:34 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Pritam Singh (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c6)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-04 11:25:32 UTC  ``` Created pki-core tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1797988](show_bug.cgi?id=1797988 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-1696 pki-core: Stored XSS in TPS profile creation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c7)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-02-07 06:30:14 UTC  ``` Do you know if this was reported in the upstream issue tracker and there is a fix?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-07 14:38:00 UTC  ``` Upstream is aware. There is currently no fix. I will check for upstream issue tracker.  However, the security consequences are very limited.  e.g. : Thanks to the webUI using client side TLS authentication, stealing a cookie will not be of much use to the attacker.  At the moment, the only concerns are defacing and minor information disclosure (user information from the victim, such as name, email and roles, which the attacker can probably have access to via other means given the privilege requirements for storing the XSS in the first place).  If/when there is a fix upstream, it will be posted on this bug tracker.  I hope this helps!   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-22 08:08:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 9.7  Via RHSA-2021:0947 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0947](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0947)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-22 09:03:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 9.4 EUS  Via RHSA-2021:0948 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0948](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0948)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1780707#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-03-23 17:35:23 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

I see there where RHSA's for it. Following up on some older CVEs noticed that this one though does not reference an upstream issue and fix. Can you help identify the fix to associate it with the CVE accordingly?
