Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-1693:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the improper handling of XML input by the Spacewalk application, specifically through its `/rpc/api` endpoint. The vulnerability stems from the application's susceptibility to XML External Entity (XXE) and XML Internal Entity attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML Internal Entity Attacks:** The application is vulnerable to XML internal entity attacks, which allows an attacker to craft malicious XML payloads to extract data or cause other malicious actions
*  **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** Although not explicitly stated, a closely related CVE-2018-1077 involved XXE, and the bug report mentions this vulnerability is "closely related" which indicates this could be another factor

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve the content of local files from the server running Spacewalk.
*   **Remote File Access:** Attackers could potentially access files remotely accessible from the host, expanding the scope of data compromise.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The vulnerability allows for SSRF, which could lead to further attacks on internal services.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be used to trigger denial-of-service attacks, making the Spacewalk service unavailable.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain circumstances, the vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the Spacewalk server. This appears to be a conditional impact, not always achievable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attack can be performed remotely and does not require authentication, making it highly accessible to potential attackers.
*   **Malicious XML Payloads:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted XML payloads to the `/rpc/api` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Spacewalk server to send the malicious XML requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was rated as "Medium" in the context of Red Hat Satellite v.5 due to the limitations on remote code execution and file retrieval.
*   A fix for the vulnerability was implemented by disabling external entity parsing as part of the `redstone-xmlrpc` library used by Spacewalk.
*   The fix was delivered as a patch to `redstone-xmlrpc` and Spacewalk 2.10.
*   The identified vulnerability is closely related to CVE-2018-1077 which was also an XXE on Spacewalk APIs.
*   The fix implemented involves setting the `http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl` feature to `true` in the `XmlRpcParser.java` class to prevent the parsing of DTDs.

In summary, CVE-2020-1693 describes a vulnerability in Spacewalk that allows for unauthenticated remote attackers to potentially read sensitive files, cause denial of service or execute arbitrary code using specially crafted XML requests via the `/rpc/api` endpoint, due to improper handling of XML input, particularly XML internal entities.
