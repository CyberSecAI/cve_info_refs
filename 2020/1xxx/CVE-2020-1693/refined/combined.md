| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1790381#c0)  msiddiqu    2020-01-13 09:36:12 UTC  ``` Spacewalk up to version 2.9 is vulnerable to XML internal entity via the /rpc/api endpoint. Using this vulnerability could allow an attacker to extract local files from the system running Spacewalk, but also files remotely accessible from the host. In addition, this vulnerability opens up the door for server side request forgery, denial of service attacks and potentially remote code execution in some cases.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1790381#c1)  msiddiqu    2020-01-13 13:42:22 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Thibaut Zonca   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1790381#c2)  Doran Moppert    2020-01-13 22:57:48 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is closely related to [CVE-2018-1077](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1077), previously reported and fixed in [bz 1555429](show_bug.cgi?id=1555429 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1077 spacewalk: XML External Entity (XXE) on Spacewalk APIs").   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1790381#c6)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-10 20:09:33 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw was rated Medium in the context of Red Hat Satellite v.5, because it does not allow remote code execution, and because of the limitation imposed when retrieving file content.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1790381#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-11 14:53:32 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/commit/74e28ec61d916c42061ef4347121650a1c962b0c>   ``` |  |
