  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ASP.NET Core cookie parser decodes the cookie name which could allow a malicious attacker to use percent encoded characters to masquerade as a different cookie with different security features.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of encoded cookie names"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass the \"Cookie Prefixes\" security mechanism by sending specially crafted cookies to a vulnerable web application, potentially leading to data integrity issues.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted cookies to a vulnerable ASP.NET Core web application."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with crafted cookies to a vulnerable ASP.NET Core web application. Successful exploitation likely requires a secondary vulnerability, for example a cross-site scripting issue."
