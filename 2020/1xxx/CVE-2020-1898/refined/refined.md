Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-1898:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `fb_unserialize` and `fb_compact_unserialize` functions in HHVM did not enforce a limit on the depth of nested deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Depth Limit:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a check to prevent excessive nesting during deserialization. This allows an attacker to construct a specially crafted serialized string with deeply nested structures.
*   **Stack Exhaustion:** The recursive nature of deserialization without a depth limit can lead to uncontrolled stack growth.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a malicious serialized string, an attacker can cause the `fb_unserialize` or `fb_compact_unserialize` function to recurse excessively, leading to stack exhaustion and a crash. This effectively results in a denial-of-service condition, making the system or service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Serialized Data:** An attacker can provide crafted input to the `fb_unserialize` or `fb_compact_unserialize` function that contains nested structures designed to trigger the excessive recursion.
*   **Input Manipulation:** Any scenario where an attacker can control the input data being processed by these functions is a potential attack vector. This could include user-supplied input, data from external sources, or other forms of untrusted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply the specially crafted serialized data to the vulnerable functions.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  There is no indication that any authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. Any unvalidated input passed to the vulnerable functions is sufficient.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a depth check to the unserialization process to limit the level of nesting, preventing stack exhaustion.
*   The vulnerability affects HHVM versions prior to 4.32.3, between 4.33.0 and 4.56.0, 4.57.0, 4.58.0, 4.58.1, 4.59.0, 4.60.0, 4.61.0, and 4.62.0. Patched versions include 4.32.3, 4.56.1, 4.57.1, 4.58.2, 4.59.1, 4.60.1, 4.61.1, 4.62.1, and 4.64.0.
*   The provided code diffs show the implementation of a depth check in the `unserializeThing`, `unserializeMap`, `unserializeVector`, `unserializeList` and `unserializeSet` methods of the `FBUnserializer` class, as well as in the `fb_compact_unserialize_from_buffer` function.
