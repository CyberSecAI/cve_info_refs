The provided content is related to CVE-2020-1905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the sequential generation of Media ContentProvider URIs used for opening attachments in other apps.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Predictable URI generation: The URIs for accessing previously opened attachments were generated sequentially, making them predictable.
- Lack of randomness or proper access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- URI guessing: A malicious third-party app could guess the URIs of previously opened attachments.
- Information disclosure: The malicious app could access the content of these attachments without proper authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious third-party app installed on the same Android device as WhatsApp.
- The malicious app needs to be chosen by the user to open a media file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to install a malicious application on the victim's Android device.
- The user needs to open a file with the malicious app at least once
- The malicious app must be chosen by the user to open a media file previously opened by WhatsApp.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed in WhatsApp for Android v2.20.185
- This means that an attacker could potentially access previously opened attachments until the malicious app was terminated.
