<p>A information disclosure vulnerability exists when TLS components use weak hash algorithms. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise a users's encrypted transmission channel.</p>
<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how TLS components use hash algorithms.</p>
