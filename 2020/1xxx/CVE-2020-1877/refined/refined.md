- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software system accesses an invalid pointer when an administrator logs in and performs certain operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Invalid pointer access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause a process reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must log in to the device network as an administrator and then perform specific operations to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the device network.
