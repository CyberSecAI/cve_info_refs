Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-1892:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `JSON_parser` function during JSON decoding, specifically when the `depth` parameter is set to 0. The code was not properly handling this case, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Boundary Checks:** The code lacked checks to prevent access to the stack when the `depth` parameter is 0. This allowed reading the `-1`th element of the stack which is out of bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from out-of-bounds memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read could cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a crafted JSON string and setting the `depth` parameter to 0 during the `json_decode` function call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to control the input to the `json_decode` function, specifically the JSON string and the `depth` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub commit shows the fix for this vulnerability by adding a check for the depth parameter and setting the error code.
- The blog post from hhvm.com confirms that this vulnerability is fixed in the listed versions.
- The blog post also mentions that this is a security update for all supported HHVM versions.
- A test case `decode_crash.php` and its expected output were added to verify the fix.
- The vulnerability is located in `hphp/runtime/ext/json/JSON_parser.cpp`
- The vulnerability was triggered when a single top level string was passed for decoding with depth set to 0.
