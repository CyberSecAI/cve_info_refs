Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-1725:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper usage of parsed claims for authorization within keycloak-gatekeeper.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how keycloak-gatekeeper processes and uses claims from access tokens to determine authorization. Specifically, changes in user role mappings in Keycloak aren't immediately reflected in resource access due to improper handling of claims after access token expiry.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Improper Resource Access**: Users might retain access to resources even after their roles are revoked or modified in Keycloak, and after expiration of the previous access token. This allows a user to perform actions they are no longer authorized to do.
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity**: This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potentially manipulation of data by unauthorized users, thus compromising both data confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a user with previously granted roles having those roles changed/revoked in Keycloak and their previous access token expired. Due to the vulnerability, the user might still have access to the resource.
*   This involves a user who has had their roles changed in Keycloak and their previous access token expires.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a user who previously had access to a resource and whose role mappings are subsequently changed in Keycloak.
*   The attacker must have a valid access token before role mappings are changed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report mentions that a user can still access resources even after their roles have been changed in Keycloak and their previous access token has expired.
*   The upstream issue is tracked at [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-11145](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-11145).
*   The bug is classified as "CLOSED NOTABUG", indicating that the issue might have been addressed in a different manner or is considered an expected behavior within the context of Keycloak-gatekeeper.
*   A fix for this was not specifically mentioned, the bug report indicates that further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page.
