Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-1976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect App handles certain data, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- The specific weakness is categorized as "External Control of Critical State Data" (CWE-642). This suggests that the application relies on external data to manage its internal state, and this external control is not properly validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of external input leads to a state where the Mac OS kernel hangs or crashes. This indicates a flaw in how the GlobalProtect App interacts with the operating system.
- The application is susceptible to a denial-of-service attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition.
- The Mac OS kernel hangs or crashes, leading to system instability and potential loss of work.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is LOCAL, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the Mac OS system running the vulnerable GlobalProtect App.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- Attack complexity is HIGH, which might imply that exploiting this is not trivial and requires a deep understanding of how the specific vulnerability works.
