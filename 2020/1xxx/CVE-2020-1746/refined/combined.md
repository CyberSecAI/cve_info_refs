| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2020-02-20 21:34:18 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ldap_attr and ldap_entry community modules for Ansbile. This issue discloses the LDAP bind password to stdout or a log file if a playbook task is written using the bind_pw in the parameters field since nothing in the params field is evaluated for sensitive data.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c2)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-28 15:34:46 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1808472](show_bug.cgi?id=1808472 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1746 ansible: Information disclosure issue in ldap_attr and ldap_entry modules [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1808471](show_bug.cgi?id=1808471 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1746 ansible: Information disclosure issue in ldap_attr and ldap_entry modules [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1808470](show_bug.cgi?id=1808470 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-1746 ansible: Information disclosure issue in ldap_attr and ldap_entry modules [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c6)  Toshio Kuratomi    2020-02-28 17:44:52 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67866>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c7)  Toshio Kuratomi    2020-02-28 17:47:35 UTC  ``` A workaround was posted by felixfontein.  Playbooks can be rewritten like this:   # Set the following variable somewhere:  # ldap_auth:  #   server_uri: ldap://localhost/  #   bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com  #   bind_pw: password  #  # In the example below, 'args' is a task keyword, passed at the same level as the module  - name: Get rid of an unneeded attribute    ldap_attr:      dn: uid=jdoe,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com      name: shadowExpire      values: []      state: exact    args: "{{ ldap_auth }}"   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c10)  Borja Tarraso    2020-03-04 16:09:23 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Using args keyword and embedding the ldap_auth variable instead of using bind_pw parameter would mitigate this issue.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c13)  Borja Tarraso    2020-03-27 07:32:44 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Felix Fountein   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-22 14:09:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:1541 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1541](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1541)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-22 14:09:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:1542 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1542](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1542)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-22 14:10:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:1543 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1543](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1543)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-22 14:10:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.7 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2020:1544 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1544](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1544)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1805491#c20)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-22 16:32:09 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

The fix will be provided from core Ansible. But we still ship ansible separately for ceph ubuntu.  * In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact, ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.   ``` |  |

Fix for [CVE-2020-1746](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j2h6-73x8-22c4 "CVE-2020-1746")

Module options that circumvent Ansible's option handling were disallowed

in:

<https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/ansible-meeting/2017-09-28/ansible_dev_meeting.2017-09-28-15.00.log.html>

Additionally, this particular usage can be insecure if bind\_pw is set

this way as the password could end up in a logfile or displayed on

stdout.

Correct. we removed params from yum\_repository and jenkins\_plugin on a short cycle before but didn't backport the changes. Since this is a security issue, we should backport it. I tried to make the change do less for 2.9 and earlier (only disallowing bind\_pw usage).

just some docs nits. I changed 'via' to 'with' but you could use 'through' instead if you think that reads better. We're trying to avoid Latin as it causes translation problems.

`fail_json` requires a `msg` keyword argument. Needs to be updated for the other places fail\_json was added too.

Doh.... I'll fix that here and also open an issue to change that behaviour in fail\_json. It's a mandatory parameter so there's no reason it shouldn't be accessible as a positional arg too.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

15:02:16 <thaumos> #chair mikedlr
15:02:16 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos albertom jtyr mikedlr ryansb shertel thaumos
15:02:29 <thaumos> can the name be changed after the fact?
15:02:37 <bcoca> end + start?
15:02:43 <thaumos> yeah, eff that
15:02:48 <thaumos> I'll call it core next time
15:02:52 <mikedlr> maybe it's a better name?
15:03:08 <thaumos> I just got feedback to not call it community meeting or something close to that, maybe to call it the dev meeting
15:03:16 <thaumos> since this is all about merging stuff into devel and what not.
15:03:26 <thaumos> there's just too many meetings now, I can't keep track.
15:03:49 <sdoran> We should hold a meeting to discuss what to call the meetings.
15:03:53 <thaumos> #topic set missing default values for ec2 inventory
15:03:55 <thaumos> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/28375
15:03:59 <bcoca> meta meeting
15:04:30 <thaumos> @jtyr this is your first one.  @shertel and @ryansb either of you have more to review for this?  I see that @sdoran has chimed in on it as well.
15:04:36 <jtyr> yes, that one just needs review
15:04:45 <shertel> +1 to merge that
15:04:51 <sdoran> Just waiting on ryansb to +1 it
15:04:55 <sdoran> +1 to merge from me
15:04:56 * ryansb will do
15:05:02 <thaumos> cool,
15:05:10 <thaumos> #action PR to be merged by ryansb or shertel
15:05:30 <thaumos> jtyr: do you still need your second topic looked at?  I am confused by your last comment
15:05:49 <jtyr> yes
15:06:03 <jtyr> we discussed it briefly yesterday
15:06:27 <thaumos> is this carry over from #ansible-devel you mean
15:06:36 <jtyr> jimi|ansible agreed that there is currently no solution that could replace 'params`
15:07:12 <bcoca> mostly we dont want anything that does it the way that params does it
15:07:36 <bcoca> we do have existing ways to provide some of the functionality, just not in a  way that bypasses our validation and security
15:07:57 <jtyr> it's all about removing 'params' from multiple modules although this option was there since the beginning of the existence of the modules ...
15:08:10 <thaumos> #topic follow up discussion to params
15:08:35 <bcoca> jtyr: i would argue that it a consequence of being missed in review
15:08:41 <jtyr> bcoca: I would prefer to get rid of 'params' and have better implementation in args ...
15:09:17 <jtyr> ansible could then validate if args contain some option which shouldn't be logged (using nolog in AnsibleModule definition)
15:10:11 <thaumos> as bcoca said yesterday, args are still here; it's still being discussed about what's going to happen with "improving" args.
15:10:21 <jtyr> bcoca: missed in a review in multiple modules even if that behavior was documented in EXAMPLES? ... unlikely ...
15:10:52 <jtyr> args are marked as "deprecated" ...
15:10:58 <thaumos> @jtyr, there are A LOT of modules... Things will get missed.  Plus now, we have automerge of community modules so things will go through the pipe as well.
15:11:19 <bcoca> does not mean we shouldn't correct things we find that are wrong
15:11:27 <thaumos> I also like to mention, at one point there were only two people that truly curated the project.
15:12:14 <jtyr> bcoca: 'wrong' is not the right word
15:12:39 <bcoca> we disagree on that
15:13:20 <jtyr> params allow to do a bit more than args ... both are not doing any validation whether the options should be obfuscated in logs ...
15:13:41 <jtyr> if we add the obfuscation, why we couldn't keep args supported?
15:13:59 <jtyr> and perhaps extend it to allow task options overrides?
15:14:04 <bcoca> args does NOT bypass validation, does not need to do it itself, params bypasses it
15:14:17 <jtyr> that's the actually only difference between params and args
15:14:17 <bcoca> args is 'general' and implemented for all tasks, params is specific to the plugin
15:14:33 <bcoca> not really, but those are the ones that matter the most to me
15:14:46 <bcoca> and enough to justify removal, imo
15:15:45 <jtyr> the thing is that you removing functionality with no alternative solution ... that's not good as it breaks a lot of roles using that feature ...
15:16:17 <bcoca> the whole concept of 'overriding optoins' is something i cannot get behind, providing defaults .. yes, but not overrides, its too much magic in the wrong direction
15:16:41 <bcoca> jtyr: I normally try to avoid that, but i think this is a case in which we must
15:17:23 <jtyr> OK, if I would ignore the override thing ... how do we add options to task after args is removed in 2.6?
15:17:46 <jtyr> default options for module won't cut it ...
15:18:07 <jtyr> or are you gonna lift the args deprecation?
15:18:31 <bcoca> pointed you yesterday at 2 of the options we are looking at
15:18:43 <bcoca> and i would be willing to discuss the deprecation
15:19:11 <thaumos> IF args are to be removed in 2.6, which by the way isn't planned yet, we will definitely think of how to improve it.
15:19:27 <jtyr> 'module defaults' and 'auth plugins' won't cut it ...
15:19:52 <bcoca> jtyr: only if you want 'overrides' .. which i think the whole team has been clear on, we dont
15:20:09 <jtyr> forget about overrides now ...
15:20:11 <bcoca> module defaults should be able to provide everything args does today
15:20:15 <jtyr> imagine file module ...
15:20:16 <abadger1999> thaumos: I think it is.
15:20:23 <jtyr> you don't want to set defaults for that module
15:20:24 <abadger1999> thaumos: We deprecated those in 2.0.
15:21:18 <bcoca> and you still have yaml anchors, which while 'not pretty' i believe are a good choice as the problem you have with them 'file locality' i find as a feature, keep the 'magic' a bit more obvious and the user can audit easily
15:21:32 <thaumos> #chair abadger1999
15:21:32 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos abadger1999 albertom jtyr mikedlr ryansb shertel thaumos
15:21:44 <jtyr> bcoca: we discussed anchors with jimi|ansible and he agreed that that's not a solution ...
15:22:02 <jimi|ansible> i did not agree that, they're useful but maybe not exactly what you want
15:22:21 <bcoca> i was going to say, that was not exactly what he said
15:22:43 <jtyr> jimi|ansible: you said that I would have to generate task files dynamically to get the same functionality args are providing ...
15:23:05 <bcoca> that is not wrong, but not the same thing as 'not a solution'
15:23:10 <bcoca> just not the same functionality
15:23:18 <thaumos> #chair jimi|ansible
15:23:18 <zodbot> Current chairs: Qalthos abadger1999 albertom jimi|ansible jtyr mikedlr ryansb shertel thaumos
15:23:22 <jimi|ansible> you may be mixing up convos from yesterday, because i'm pretty sure i didn't say that
15:23:37 <jtyr> yeah, then the solution could also be not to use Ansible at all ... that's not the right approach ...
15:23:38 <bcoca> also, there is a way around that by making the yaml anchor 'dynamic' based on vars passed in
15:23:50 <abadger1999> jtyr: Aren't we ignoring overrides now?
15:23:57 <jtyr> yes
15:24:18 <abadger1999> So don't anchors work if you ignore overrides?
15:24:25 <bcoca> also, aren't we drifting away from the topic? which is removing params from the plugin?
15:24:28 <abadger1999> jtyr: (it was agaffney who said dynamically generating the playbook)
15:24:45 <bcoca> ^ and again, there is easy way around that
15:24:50 <jtyr> how do you pass defaults or vars variable to an anchor?
15:25:14 <bcoca> in the anchor you make it depend on the vars/defaults
15:25:24 <bcoca> the anchor itself is just yaml
15:25:25 <jtyr> abadger1999: oh, yeah ... different nick ... sorry jimi|ansible ;o)
15:26:13 <jtyr> bcoca: so the anchor must have static list of options ... that doesn't help much ...
15:26:37 <bcoca> why?
15:26:44 <bcoca> also, not true
15:26:49 <abadger1999> thaumos: Just checked... yes, Using variables for the args dict is going away in 2.6.
15:26:57 <jtyr> if I cannot make the whole anchor's content as a variable then it makes no sense ...
15:27:05 <bcoca> jtyr: again, not true
15:27:20 <abadger1999> (individual args is okay.  it's setting args: "{{ dict }}"   that's going away)
15:27:23 <bcoca> and yes, you can
15:27:38 <bcoca> abadger1999: but that is exactly what he wants
15:27:52 <abadger1999> bcoca: <nod>  I'm clarifying for thaumos
15:28:00 <bcoca> roger
15:28:07 <thaumos> abadger1999: thx for looking at that.  My point is, we're only discussing what's going to be in 2.5.  We're ahead of ourselves.
15:28:10 <jtyr> bcoca: please could you show me how I can define an anchor whose content is another variable? ... no keys defined inside that anchor ...
15:28:13 <abadger1999> k
15:28:28 <bcoca> helo: &helo "{{var}}" ?
15:29:01 * jtyr is checking
15:30:08 <jtyr> bcoca: it doesn't work
15:30:19 <jtyr> anchor must be a dict not string
15:31:34 <bcoca> not true, it can be any yaml var type
15:31:58 <bcoca> https://gist.github.com/bcoca/a9d373c2520dbf03bfbb07aa5aaa2719
15:32:18 <sivel> I am still strongly infavor of saying that using default(omit) is the best practice/recommendation
15:32:26 <bcoca> ok: [localhost] => {
15:32:27 <bcoca> "test1": "helo"
15:32:28 <bcoca> }
15:32:30 <bcoca> sivel: agreed
15:32:56 <bcoca> jtyr:  none of your statements about anchors are accurate
15:33:14 <bcoca> even if they were, i would still not consider keeping 'params'
15:33:15 <jtyr> sivel: not if the module has 30+ options ...
15:33:31 <sivel> of course it is
15:34:22 <jtyr> sivel: I don't agree ... it's a nightmare to parametrize all 30+ possible options only because there is no other way how to do it ...
15:34:40 <sivel> it's a 1 time thing, and more accurately reflects what is going to happen, as opposed to arbitrary vars passing that isn't explicit
15:35:00 <bcoca> and breaks auditabilty, one of the things i most like about ansible
15:35:11 <sivel> manging something like "params" makes things much more confusing and difficult to troubleshoot
15:35:23 <thaumos> Alright, I am going to have to put a hold on this conversation in a little bit.  We aren't getting anywhere.
15:35:30 <sivel> ++
15:35:36 <abadger1999> thaumos: need a vote I think
15:35:44 <bcoca> +1 to remove
15:35:50 <thaumos> what are we voting on, it's going to get removed.
15:36:05 <jtyr> bcoca: https://pastebin.com/GLg35MKz ... this is syntax error ...
15:36:08 <abadger1999> +1 remove
15:36:46 <abadger1999> there may be a use case here but params as a solution is worse than the problem.
15:37:11 <sdoran> +1 to remove
15:37:39 <jtyr> abadger1999: I'm not against removing params ... I just would like agrs stay as a replacement ... although it doesn't do replacements ...
15:38:26 <thaumos> jtyr, args are being revisited.
15:38:33 <thaumos> params are being removed.
15:38:45 <thaumos> args will be discussed in the future before deprecated.
15:38:46 <jtyr> thaumos: they they should be not marked as deprecated ...
15:38:55 <thaumos> they were marked in the past.
15:39:11 <jtyr> thaumos: then let's undo it ;o)
15:39:29 <abadger1999> jtyr: setting htem via a dict is marked as deprecated because it is unsafe.  security trumps convenience.
15:39:37 <thaumos> I'd rather improve than step backwards.
15:39:44 <thaumos> we step back way too much as it is.
15:40:17 <abadger1999> we can look at whether there's a way around the security concerns that lets us kep that functionality, but can't reprioritize convenience over security.
15:40:34 <sivel> +1 to remove, sorry.  Looked away
15:40:45 <jtyr> abadger1999: it's unsafe the same way like params ... this is why I wanted to implement some security checking (check for nolog=True in AnsibleModule) ...
15:41:55 <sivel> In any case jimi said params was being removed regardless, due to a CVE
15:42:04 <sivel> not sure a vote was really needed in that context
15:42:16 <thaumos> only because abadger1999 called for one :-)
15:42:35 <thaumos> he keeps me from turning into The Hyde BDFL
15:42:45 <sivel> I like BDFL :)
15:42:49 <abadger1999> sivel: the CVE is related but different.
15:43:54 <jtyr> abadger1999: if args will stay then I'm happy to remove params ...
15:44:09 <thaumos> okay, moving on from this topic. we will revisit the args discussion at a later day.
15:44:22 <thaumos> we have one more topic to cover that albertom has been patiently waiting to discuss
15:44:39 <thaumos> #action discussion to continue over args at a later day for 2.6.
15:44:41 <albertom> sup!
15:44:46 * jtyr is sad
15:44:58 <thaumos> #topic os keystone endpoint module submission
15:45:04 * albertom passes a puppy to jtyr
15:45:06 <albertom> dont be
15:45:17 <thaumos> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/29031
15:45:55 * jtyr bited the puppy's head off
15:46:06 <thaumos> ...
15:46:08 <sivel> I think we need input from one of the openstack module maintainers.  I'd review, but it would only be code review
15:46:43 <sivel> although looks like there are 2 shipits from people who were pinged
15:47:01 <sivel> but only 1 since recent updates
15:47:20 <thaumos> albertom: like dag said, we just need one more shipit from the Openstack community to have this considered to be merged.
15:47:28 <thaumos> same person said shipit twice, @sivel
15:47:32 <shertel> does the bot pick up shipits in review comments?
15:48:20 <sivel> thaumos: ah, thought I saw one from mgale, but was wrong
15:48:32 <thaumos> I had to doubletake on it as well, sivel
15:48:45 <sivel> shertel: unknown,
15:48:52 <thaumos> I don't believe it does shertel
15:49:24 <sivel> jtanner doesn;t seem to be in here, and I beliefe thaumos is correct
15:49:26 <thaumos> that being said, it's a new module so it still needs us to merge it.
15:49:28 <rcarrillocruz> i can look at the keystone module
15:49:30 <rcarrillocruz> probably tomorrow
15:49:34 <rcarrillocruz> albertom: ^
15:49:37 <albertom> good!
15:49:54 <thaumos> @sdoran you interested in looking at this too?
15:50:05 <sdoran> Yup
15:50:39 <jtanner> Iirc bot does see shipits in review coomoents as of a few weeks ago
15:51:17 <thaumos> oh right on
15:51:33 <shertel> nice!
15:51:59 <thaumos> either way, rcarrillocruz is on the team_openstack list.  If he gives it a shipit we're good to have it merged.
15:52:18 <thaumos> since it's new it'll still be a manual ack
15:52:21 <rcarrillocruz> yah, promise to look early in my morning and merge it if all good
15:52:26 <rcarrillocruz> otherwise albertom ping me directly
15:53:11 <albertom> ack
15:53:11 <thaumos> #action rcarrillocruz and sdoran to look at the PR
15:53:28 <thaumos> #action albertom to poke at rcarrillocruz if needed
15:53:34 <thaumos> #topic Open Floor
15:53:49 <thaumos> any last items not covered to be discussed?
15:54:14 <mikedlr> review my RDS modules pls.  It's a strategic feature for 2.5 since we want to deprecate the old rds module..
15:54:42 <thaumos> #info play with the new shiny RDS module and provide feedback folks!
15:54:57 <thaumos> @mikedlr, link to the PR?
15:55:01 <abadger1999> #link https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/30746
15:55:16 <thaumos> thx abadger1999
15:55:18 <mikedlr> thanks abadger1999
15:55:52 <mikedlr> N.B. that's got multiple modules in it so that I can run proper integration tests and thus includes some merge commits;  the final PRs will be separated and clean.
15:58:27 <thaumos> 👍
15:58:36 <thaumos> alrighty, if nothing else I am going to end the meeting
15:58:41 <thaumos> thanks everyone!
15:58:47 <thaumos> #endmeeting

                 CVE-2020-14365 CVE-2021-20228

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>
