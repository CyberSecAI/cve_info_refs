{
  "CVE-2020-1746": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine when the ldap_attr and ldap_entry community modules are used. The issue discloses the LDAP bind password to stdout or a log file if a playbook task is written using the bind_pw in the parameters field. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data confidentiality.",
    "Root cause": "The ldap_attr and ldap_entry modules in Ansible were not properly sanitizing the parameters passed to them, specifically the `bind_pw` parameter. This caused the password to be printed to stdout or a log file when a playbook task was written using `bind_pw` in the parameters field.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
       "Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied parameters"
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive LDAP bind passwords, which could lead to unauthorized access to the LDAP server.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Ansible playbook that uses the affected modules with the `bind_pw` parameter in the parameters field.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to write and execute Ansible playbooks on a system where the vulnerable modules are used. This often means having access to the Ansible control node."
