Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a nonce reuse issue within the secure mode of the Ceph messenger v2 (msgr2) protocol. Specifically, the issue occurs in long-lived sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Nonce Reuse:** The primary weakness is the reuse of a nonce value within the msgr2 protocol's secure mode. This is a critical flaw in cryptographic protocols as nonces are intended to be unique for each use.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity Breach:** The reuse of a nonce compromises both the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted messages in the affected Ceph deployments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Forged Authentication Tags:** An attacker can forge authentication tags by exploiting the nonce reuse.
*   **Data Manipulation:** By forging auth tags, an attacker can potentially manipulate data.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Messages encrypted using the reused nonce can be decrypted leading to a loss of confidentiality.
*   **Integrity Breach:** Data can be modified without detection, leading to a loss of integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack occurs through the network by exploiting the vulnerable Ceph msgr2 protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept or interact with network traffic using the Ceph messenger v2 protocol. They need to be in a position to send crafted messages to a Ceph cluster using the vulnerable msgr2 protocol to reuse nonces.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable protocol to create forged authentication tags using the reused nonce.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ceph versions where the secure mode of the msgr2 protocol is enabled.
*   Red Hat Ceph Storage 4 and Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4.2 are specifically mentioned as affected.
*   Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3 are not affected because they do not support secure mode of messenger v2.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in commit `fe387e02b11df98357d8cdbfa3b1f1d5f2bb3f74`.
*   Patches have been merged in the upstream Octopus version 15.2.1 and Nautilus version 14.2.9.

In summary, CVE-2020-1759 describes a critical vulnerability in Ceph's msgr2 protocol where a nonce reuse issue allows attackers to compromise confidentiality and integrity.
