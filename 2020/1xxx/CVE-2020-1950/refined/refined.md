Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-1950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Apache Tika processes specially crafted or corrupt PSD (Photoshop Document) files. Specifically, the PSD parser within Apache Tika can be triggered into excessive memory usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Excessive Memory Usage:** The core weakness is that a malicious PSD file can cause Apache Tika to consume an excessive amount of memory during processing.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** This excessive memory consumption can lead to a denial-of-service condition, potentially crashing the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service attack, rendering the Apache Tika service unavailable. This is achieved by providing a crafted PSD file designed to consume excessive memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File Upload/Processing:** The attack vector involves an attacker providing a specially crafted PSD file to a system using Apache Tika for file processing. The system attempts to parse the file, leading to the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted PSD file to a system running Apache Tika. This could involve uploading the file through a web interface, sending it via email, or other means of file transfer where Tika is involved in processing the data.
*   **No Specific Network Position Required:** The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the vulnerable service, as the attack vector involves the transmission and processing of a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that CVE-2020-1950 is related to excessive memory usage when processing a malicious PSD file, and it is associated with a denial of service vulnerability.
*   A patch was implemented to address this vulnerability which include xmp extraction from PSD files.
*   This vulnerability was addressed in Ubuntu with the package update `libtika-java` to version `1.5-4ubuntu0.1`.
*   The vulnerability is also fixed in Debian 8 (Jessie) with tika version `1.5-1+deb8u1`.
