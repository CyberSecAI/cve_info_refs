Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1987:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an information exposure issue within the logging component of the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect App. Specifically, when the troubleshooting logging level is set to "Dump," the application logs VPN cookie information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Information Exposure: The application logs sensitive VPN cookie information when a specific logging level is enabled.
- Debug Information: The vulnerability is triggered by the use of debug information logging (specifically the "Dump" logging level) which exposes more data than intended for normal operations.
- CWE-215: The vulnerability is categorized as "Information Exposure Through Debug Information" (CWE-215).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Impact: A local, authenticated user can gain access to VPN cookie information. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or impersonation if the leaked cookies can be used to access resources protected by the VPN.
- No Integrity or Availability Impact:  The vulnerability does not allow an attacker to modify data or disrupt service availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable GlobalProtect App is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Authenticated User: The attacker must be an authenticated user with local access to the system.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to trigger the debug logging level, which likely involves user interaction with the application settings.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-1987 describes a low-severity vulnerability where a local user can access sensitive VPN cookie information by enabling debug-level logging in the GlobalProtect app. The primary risk is the potential compromise of VPN access via exposed cookies. This issue is resolved in GlobalProtect App versions 5.0.9 and 5.1.1, and later versions.
