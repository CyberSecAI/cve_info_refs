Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-1698:

**Root Cause:** A logged exception in the `HttpMethod` class of Keycloak may leak passwords passed as parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability stems from an exception logging mechanism that inadvertently includes sensitive password information in the log output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data confidentiality is the main concern. An attacker with access to the logs could potentially extract leaked passwords.
