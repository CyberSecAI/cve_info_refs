Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1814

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a race condition between different operations within the affected Huawei firewall products, specifically when the IPSEC function is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Dangling Pointer Reference:** Due to the race condition, a dangling pointer reference occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation leads to a dangling pointer reference, which results in abnormal service behavior. The advisory mentions "some service abnormal" without specifying the exact type of service disruption or its severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device.
*   **Special Operations:** The attacker needs to perform special operations in the affected product in specific scenarios to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the firewall device to perform the required special operations.
*   An attacker needs to have network access to the device to interact with it and trigger the vulnerable code.
*   The attacker needs to know that the IPSEC function is enabled on the device.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

The following Huawei firewall products and versions are affected:

*   **NIP6800:**
    *   V500R001C30
    *   V500R001C60SPC500
