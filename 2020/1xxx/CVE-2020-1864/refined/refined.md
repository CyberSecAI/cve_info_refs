- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication implementation in some Huawei products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of the authentication function, allowing attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can connect to affected devices and execute a series of commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, control, or disruption of the device's functionalities.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker needs to obtain some specific information and forge the peer device to send specific packets to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be remote and have some knowledge of the target device's communication protocol and required information to forge the peer device and craft malicious packets.
