Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-1982:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of TLS 1.0 for certain communications between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services, including Cortex Data Lake, the Customer Support Portal, and Prisma Access infrastructure. TLS 1.0 is considered a cryptographically weak protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of a weak cryptographic protocol (TLS 1.0) that is susceptible to known attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory states that conditions required for exploiting known TLS 1.0 weaknesses do not exist for the described communication, and they are not aware of any malicious exploitation. However, the use of TLS 1.0 exposes the system to potential man-in-the-middle attacks. The potential impact includes:
    - **Low Confidentiality Impact:**  Possible exposure of transmitted data.
    - **Low Integrity Impact:** Potential alteration of transmitted data.
    - **No Availability Impact:** No impact on the availability of the services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.
- **High Attack Complexity**: Exploiting this would require a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and potentially modify communication between PAN-OS devices and the cloud services.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory mentions that Palo Alto Networks intends to end support for TLS 1.0 in their cloud service endpoints by November 8, 2023.
- The issue affects various versions of PAN-OS:
    - All versions of PAN-OS 8.0
    - PAN-OS 8.1 versions prior to 8.1.14
    - PAN-OS 9.0 versions prior to 9.0.9
    - PAN-OS 9.1 versions prior to 9.1.3
- PAN-OS 7.1 is not affected.
- The issue is fixed in PAN-OS versions 8.1.14, 9.0.9, 9.1.3, and all later versions.
- Workarounds include ensuring network security to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.
- The vulnerability was discovered in production use.
