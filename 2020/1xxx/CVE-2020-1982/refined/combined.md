### Description

Certain communication between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services inadvertently use TLS 1.0, which is known to be a cryptographically weak protocol.

These cloud services include Cortex Data Lake, the Customer Support Portal, and the Prisma Access infrastructure.

Conditions required for exploitation of known TLS 1.0 weaknesses do not exist for the communication between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services. We do not believe that any communication is impacted as a result of known attacks against TLS 1.0.

This issue impacts:

All versions of PAN-OS 8.0;

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.14;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3.

PAN-OS 7.1 is not impacted by this issue.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.3 | >= 9.1.3 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.9 | >= 9.0.9 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.14 | >= 8.1.14 |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | All | None |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | None | All |

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
4.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N))

### Exploitation Status

Conditions required for exploitation of known TLS 1.0 weaknesses do not exist for the communication between PAN-OS and cloud delivered services. Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.14, PAN-OS 9.0.9, PAN-OS 9.1.3, and all later PAN-OS versions.

We intend to end support for TLS 1.0 in our cloud service endpoints on November 8, 2023. You must upgrade to PAN-OS 8.1.14, PAN-OS 9.0.9, PAN-OS 9.1.3, or later PAN-OS versions to continue uninterrupted access to cloud-delivered services and updates.

PAN-OS 7.1 and PAN-OS 8.0 are end-of-life (as of June 30, 2020 and October 31, 2019 respectively) and are no longer covered by our Product Security Assurance policies.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Since TLS 1.0 weaknesses are exploited by the man-in-the-middle type of attackers, ensuring security of the networks reduces risks of exploitation of these issues.

### Acknowledgments

This issue was found by a customer.
