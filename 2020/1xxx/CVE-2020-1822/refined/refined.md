- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to out-of-bounds read errors in the implementation of the COPS protocol when processing incoming data packets. Specifically, a decoding function may perform an out-of-bounds read operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to disruption of service on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited when an attacker has network access to the affected device and sends a specially crafted COPS data packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the affected device and have the ability to send network packets.
