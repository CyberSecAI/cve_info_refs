- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to the software reading data beyond the intended buffer when parsing crafted DHCP messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to abnormal service behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers need to be on the adjacent network of the target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have access to the victim's adjacent network and be able to send crafted DHCP messages.
