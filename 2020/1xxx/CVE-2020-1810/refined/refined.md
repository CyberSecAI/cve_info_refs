- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected Huawei products use the RSA algorithm in the SSL key exchange, which is considered a weak algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a weak RSA algorithm in SSL key exchange.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can potentially leak sensitive information by exploiting the weak RSA algorithm.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.

The advisory provides a detailed list of affected Huawei products and software versions, along with the corresponding fixed versions. It also includes the CVSSv3 base score, temporal score, and technical details about the vulnerability and exploitation conditions. The advisory states that the vulnerability was discovered by Huawei internal tester and recommends contacting Huawei TAC for upgrades.
