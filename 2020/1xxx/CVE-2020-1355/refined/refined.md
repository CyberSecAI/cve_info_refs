  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of font files in fontdrvhost.exe. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
  "root_cause": "Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during font file parsing in fontdrvhost.exe",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability"

  "attack_vectors": [
    "Visiting a malicious page",
    "Opening a malicious file"
