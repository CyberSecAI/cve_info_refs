These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient certificate validation when establishing HTTPS requests with the affected device.  For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-cert-check-BdZZV9T3>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Data Center Network Manager releases earlier than 11.5(1). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2020-1276: Cisco Data Center Network Manager Certificate Validation Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Device Manager application of Cisco DCNM could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify a specific API request that is used to verify a user's authentication token.  This vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the SSL certificate used when establishing a connection to the Device Manager application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter a specific API request.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvv82441](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv82441)CVE ID: CVE-2021-1276Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N  **CVE-2021-1277: Cisco Data Center Network Manager Certificate Validation Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in Cisco DCNM could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to spoof a trusted host or construct a man-in-the-middle attack to extract sensitive information from the affected device.  This vulnerability is due to a lack of certificate validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted X.509 certificate and could then intercept communications. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and alter potentially sensitive information that DCNM maintains about clients that are connected to the network.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvv35348](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv35348), [CSCvv35346](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv35346), [CSCvv35354](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv35354)CVE ID: CVE-2021-1277Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco DCNM releases 11.5(1) and later.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.  Source  * These vulnerabilities were found during internal security testing.
