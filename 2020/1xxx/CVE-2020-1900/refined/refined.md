Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of dynamic properties when unserializing objects in HHVM. Specifically, the code failed to pre-allocate the full size of the dynamic property array before inserting data into it during unserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:**  The lack of pre-allocation could lead to the dynamic property array being resized during unserialization, which would invalidate previously stored references. This could result in a use-after-free condition when those invalid references are later accessed, which can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a crash due to a use-after-free condition and potentially, further exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `unserialize()` function in HHVM. An attacker needs to provide specially crafted serialized data that triggers the improper handling of dynamic properties during unserialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious serialized data to be processed by the vulnerable `unserialize()` function in HHVM. This typically would require the attacker to control some input data used by the application that uses HHVM. The attacker must also know how to generate the malicious serialized input

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in HHVM version 4.32.3 and all versions after 4.64.0.
- A commit `c1c4bb0` on the facebook/hhvm repository addresses the vulnerability by adding code to pre-reserve the necessary space for dynamic properties during unserialization.
- The vulnerability is described as a critical severity issue.
