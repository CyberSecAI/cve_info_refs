  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of fonts. Crafted data in a font can trigger a write past the end of a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
  "root_cause": "Crafted data in a font can trigger a write past the end of a heap-based buffer.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds write",
    "Heap-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "impact": "Escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
