# Advisory Details

July 16th, 2020
## Microsoft Windows PFB Font File Out-Of-Bounds Write Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-877ZDI-CAN-10903

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-1436](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-1436) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Windows |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of fonts. Crafted data in a font can trigger a write past the end of a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

A Patch is available for [xfs 1.0.4](http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R7.3/patches/xorg-xfs-1.0.4-query.diff).

## X.Org 7.2

* April 3, 2007 - CVE-2007-1003 CVE-2007-1351 CVE-2007-1352 CVE-2007-1352: Lack of validation of parameters passed to the X server and libX11 by client application can lead to various kinds of integer overflows or stack overflows that can be used to overwrite data in the X server memory. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2007-April/000286.html) for more information. Patches are available for [7.2](http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R7.2/patches).

## X.Org 7.1

* January 9, 2007 - CVE-2006-6101 CVE-2006-6102 CVE-2006-6103: The ProcDbeGetVisualInfo(), ProcDbeSwapBuffer() and ProcRenderAddGlyphs() functions in the X server, implementing requests for the dbe and render extensions, may be used to overwrite data on the stack or in other parts of the X server's memory. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2007-January/000235.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/), [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/), [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/) and [7.1](../../Releases/7.1/).
* September 12, 2006 - It may be possible for a user with the ability to set the X server font path, by making it point to a malicious font, to cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service on the X server. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2006-September/000128.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/), [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/), [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/) and [7.1](../../Releases/7.1/).

## X.Org 6.9.0/7.0

* June 20, 2006 - A lack of checks for setuid() failures when invoked by a privileged process (e.g., X server, xdm, xterm, if installed setuid or setgid) may cause the process to execute certain privileged operations (file access) as root while it was intended to be executed with a less privileged effective user ID, on systems where setuid() called by root can fail. This can be used by a malicious local user to overwrite files and possibly elevate privileges in some corner cases. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2006-June/000100.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/), [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/), [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/) and [7.1](../../Releases/7.1/).
* May 2, 2006 - A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server as shipped with X11R6.8.x, X11R6.9.0 and X11R7.0 (xorg-server 1.0.x) -- this is [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526). Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute malicious code within the X server. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2006-May/015136.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/), [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/) and [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/).
* March 20, 2006 - A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server as shipped with X11R6.9.0 and X11R7.0 (xorg-server 1.0.0 and 1.0.1) -- this is [CVE-2006-0745](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-0745). Local users were able to escalate privileges to root and cause a DoS if the Xorg server was installed setuid root (the default). Note that earlier releases are not vulnerable. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2006-March/013858.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/) and [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/). If you are running X11R7.0, you can upgrade xorg-server to 1.0.2 or later ([release announcement](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2006-March/013993.html)).

## X.Org 6.8.2

* September 12, 2005 - Due to missing range checks for the pixel size of the pixmap subsequent pixmap read/write functions can access memory outside of the allocated pixmap by any X client that can connect to the affected X server. This way any user having access to the server can access memory that is accessible from within the X server and/or crash the server. The CVE number for these vulnerabilities is [CVE-2005-2495](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2495). A patch against [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/) is available.

## X.Org 6.8.1

* November 17, 2004 - X.Org was made aware of additional security vulnerability in libXpm, the X Pixmap library, which is shipped as part of the X Window System. The affected library is used in many popular application for image viewing and manipulation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name [CVE-2004-0914](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0914) to these issues. Patches are provided for [6.8.0](../../Releases/6.8/) and [6.8.1](../../Releases/6.8.1/). The problem is fixed in 6.8.2 and later.

## X.Org 6.8.0

* September 15, 2004 - A security vulnerability has been found in libXpm, the X pixmap library which is shipped as part of the X Window System. Please check [here](http://ftp.x.org/pub/X11R6.8.0/patches/README.xorg-CAN-2004-0687-0688.patch) for further information. This problem has been fixed in [6.8.1](../../Releases/6.8.1/). We also provide a patch for [6.8.0](../../Releases/6.8/) and earlier.

## X11R6.6 and older

*This is not a complete listing of older security issues, just those discovered more recently*

* July 24, 2012 - CVE-2012-1699: A vulnerability has been found in the X11R6 font server code in the handling of the `SetEventMask` request in xfs which can lead to either denial of service or a leak of information from the xfs process address space. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2012-July/002040.html) for more information. Patch is included in the advisory. Fix is included in XFree86 3.3.3 and later, and X.Org X11R6.7 and later.
