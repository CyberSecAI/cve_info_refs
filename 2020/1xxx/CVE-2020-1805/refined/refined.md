The provided content is a security advisory from Huawei regarding three out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in several of their smartphones. This advisory directly mentions CVE-2020-1805 along with CVE-2020-1804 and CVE-2020-1806.

**Root Cause:**
* The root cause is insufficient validation of certain parameters received by a driver program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* Out-of-bounds read: The lack of proper parameter validation in the driver program leads to reading several bytes beyond the intended memory boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Information disclosure: Successful exploitation can potentially leak sensitive information.
* Service abnormality: Exploitation could lead to abnormal behavior or crashes of the affected service/system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attacker must trick the user into installing a crafted application, which suggests a local attack vector that relies on social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious application and trick the user into installing it. User interaction is required for the exploitation to occur.
* The attacker would require some level of elevated privileges on the device to communicate with the driver program, as indicated by the CVSSv3 vector having a high privilege requirement (PR:H).

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory provides specific affected versions and the corresponding fixed versions for the Honor V10 smartphone model.
* It also includes the CVSSv3 base and temporal scores. The base score is 3.1 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L), and the temporal score is 2.9 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C). These scores indicate a low-impact, locally exploitable vulnerability, which requires high privileges and user interaction.
* The advisory also mentions that these vulnerabilities were reported by an external security researcher.
