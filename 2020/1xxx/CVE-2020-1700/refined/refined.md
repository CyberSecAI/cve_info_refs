Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-1700:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Ceph RGW Beast front-end does not properly handle unexpected disconnects, leading to a connection leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Connection leak: Upon unexpected disconnects, the RGW Beast front-end fails to properly close the socket connection.
- Resource exhaustion: Repeated disconnects from an attacker leads to an accumulation of CLOSE_WAIT sockets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The accumulation of leaked sockets results in resource exhaustion, preventing legitimate users from connecting to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is triggered by sending multiple disconnect requests to the RGW server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the RGW server.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the RGW server.
- Multiple disconnects: The attacker needs to send a series of disconnect requests to trigger the leak.
