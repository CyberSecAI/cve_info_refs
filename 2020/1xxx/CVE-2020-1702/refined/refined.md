Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way container images are handled by the `containers/image` library. Specifically, the library reads the entire image manifest into memory. A maliciously crafted container image can have an excessively large manifest, causing excessive memory consumption when pulled to a container runtime host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unbounded Memory Consumption:** The core issue is the lack of a limit on the amount of data read into memory when processing a container image manifest.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A large manifest can lead to a denial of service by exhausting the memory of the process responsible for pulling the image.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Process Crash:** An attacker can cause the process pulling the image (e.g., `podman`, `buildah`, `skopeo`, `cri-o`) to crash due to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Potential Service Disruption:** If the affected process is critical for container management, its crash can disrupt container operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Container Image:** The primary attack vector involves creating and distributing a container image with an unusually large manifest.
*   **Image Pull Operation:** The attacker needs to trick a user with privileges to pull container images.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Image Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create and potentially distribute a malicious container image.
*   **User Interaction/Privileges:** The attacker needs a way to entice a user with the necessary privileges to pull their malicious image, leading to the memory exhaustion. The attacker does not need direct access to the system or container runtime.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various container-related tools, including `podman`, `buildah`, `skopeo`, and `cri-o`.
*   The issue was fixed by limiting the amount of data read from the manifest. The fix is associated with  <https://github.com/containers/image/pull/805> and <https://github.com/containers/image/pull/803>.
*   Red Hat provided errata updates to address this vulnerability in multiple products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift Container Platform.
*   The bug report includes tracking bugs for specific products and versions, demonstrating widespread impact across Red Hat's container ecosystem.
