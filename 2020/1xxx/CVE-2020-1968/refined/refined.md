        "text": "Root cause of vulnerability: A flaw in the TLS specification allows attackers to compute the pre-master secret in connections using Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuites if the DH secret is reused across multiple TLS connections.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reusing DH secrets across multiple TLS connections.  Vulnerable ciphersuites are identified by the 'DH-' prefix (e.g. 'DH-RSA-AES256-SHA') and IANA names starting with 'TLS_DH_' (excluding those starting with 'TLS_DH_anon_').\n\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker can eavesdrop on encrypted communications sent over a TLS connection that reuses DH secrets.\n\nAttack vectors: A remote attacker could potentially exploit this flaw by eavesdropping on encrypted communications.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic."
