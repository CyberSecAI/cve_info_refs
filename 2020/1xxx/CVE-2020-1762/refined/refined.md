Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1762

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Kiali's improper validation of JWT (JSON Web Token) claim fields, specifically ignoring the `subject` and `expiration` fields. This allowed for the use of compromised or stale tokens.
- Additionally, the provided text mentions that credentials were not being validated properly, which could lead to unauthorized access with forged or invalid credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient JWT Validation:** Kiali failed to validate the critical `subject` and `expiration` claims within JWTs, making the authentication susceptible to replay attacks with stale or compromised tokens.
- **Improper Credential Validation:** The application did not adequately validate credentials, which extended the risk beyond just JWTs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers could bypass Kiali's authentication mechanisms by forging credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could grant attackers unauthorized access to the Kiali web application.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker might gain privileges to view and alter the Istio configuration, potentially compromising the whole environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged Credentials:** An attacker could construct and use crafted credentials to authenticate to Kiali, bypassing authentication controls.
- **Stolen JWT Cookie:** An attacker could steal a valid JWT cookie and reuse it to gain unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Kiali application.
- **Knowledge of Forging/Reusing Credentials:** An attacker needs to be able to forge or reuse valid credentials (like the JWT cookie).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Kiali versions 0.4.0 to 1.15.0.
*   The vulnerability applies to all four authentication mechanisms in Kiali: login, token, openshift and ldap.
*   The provided information references another CVE related to this issue ([CVE-2020-1764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1764)). However, that CVE is not detailed in the provided text.
*   The fix involves updating to Kiali version 1.15.1 or later. Setting a secure signing key can also mitigate this, as described in the mitigation section of the security bulletin.
