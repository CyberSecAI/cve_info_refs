Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1978:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the inadvertent inclusion of Azure dashboard service account credentials within TechSupport files generated by Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls on Microsoft Azure configured for High Availability (HA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credentials Management (CWE-255):**  The core issue is the improper handling of sensitive credentials. Specifically, the tech support files were collecting and storing the Azure service account credentials.
- **Insecure Data Storage:** The credentials were being stored in the tech support files which were not intended for holding sensitive information, thus creating an insecure storage mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (HIGH):** The extracted credentials provide access to manage most Azure resources within the compromised subscription.
- **Availability Impact (HIGH):** The ability to manage resources can lead to disruptions in service by unauthorized resource manipulation or deletion.
- **Limited Integrity Impact (NONE):** The impact is limited, as the attacker cannot use the credentials to log in to the virtual machines directly, and can't grant access to other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). An attacker would need access to the generated Tech Support files.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction (UI:R) is required since the tech support files must be generated by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileges Required (HIGH):** An attacker would need to have high privileges on the system where the tech support files are stored and accessible to gain access to the extracted credentials. This could be via an administrator account or through a compromised system that has access to the generated files.
- **Local system access:** The attacker would need to obtain the generated tech support files.
- **Knowledge of where to locate the tech support files:** The attacker would need to know that the files contain sensitive credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The credentials have the equivalent permissions of an Azure "Contributor" role.
- The vulnerability affects VM-Series Plugin versions before 1.0.9 for PAN-OS 9.0 specifically when configured for HA on Microsoft Azure.
- Palo Alto Networks has addressed the vulnerability by filtering and removing these credentials from newly generated TechSupport files and deleting all files with the credentials.
- The advisory mentions that there is no evidence of malicious access or use of these credentials.
