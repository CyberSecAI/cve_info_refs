{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `InstancePath`, `ClassName`, and `InstanceName` parameters of the `CHaD.asmx` web service.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection (CWE-89)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access sensitive information stored in the database, potentially including usernames and password hashes. The attacker could also modify or delete data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted SOAP web requests to the `CHaD.asmx` web service with malicious SQL code injected into the vulnerable parameters.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can send unauthenticated HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerabilities, meaning no prior access or authentication is needed."
