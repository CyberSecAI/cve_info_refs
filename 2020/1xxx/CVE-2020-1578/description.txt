An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to retrieve information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve the memory address of a kernel object.
To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles memory addresses.
