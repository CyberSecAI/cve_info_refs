- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Certain function interface in the system does not sufficiently validate the caller's identity in certain share scenarios.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication of caller identity when sharing information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker tricks the user into installing a malicious application which then exploits the insufficient caller identity validation during a share operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create and get the user to install a malicious application.
