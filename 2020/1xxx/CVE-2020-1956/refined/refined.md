Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1956:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user-controlled input being concatenated into a system command string within the `migrateCube()` method of the `CubeService` class in Apache Kylin. Specifically, the `projectName` from the URL is directly inserted into the command string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `projectName` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the construction of a system command.
- **Insecure Configuration:**  The application retrieves configuration settings (`srcCfgUri` and `dstCfgUri`) which, if tampered with, can lead to further command injection when used in the command string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the server hosting the Apache Kylin instance, including access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/kylin/api/cubes/{cube}/{project}/migrate` endpoint, injecting malicious commands into the `project` path parameter.
- **Configuration Tampering:** An attacker with proper privileges can modify the `srcCfgUri` and `dstCfgUri` configurations via the Cube Designer in order to inject commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with either `MANAGEMENT` or `ADMIN` permissions on any project in Kylin.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Kylin web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Apache Kylin versions 2.3.0 up to 2.6.5 and 3.0.1.
- The initial patch implemented a denylist approach which was deemed error-prone, and was later replaced with a safer allowlist approach.
- The allowlist approach ensures user-provided parameters are sanitized to avoid command injection, but it's still crucial to ensure the executed shell script (*kylin.sh*) itself does not contain security flaws related to those parameters.
- The vulnerability is rated as "important" by Apache.
- A configuration flag, *kylin.tool.auto-migrate-cube.enabled*, can be set to `false` to disable the Cube migrations feature and prevent exploitation.
