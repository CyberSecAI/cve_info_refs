Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-1928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The sensitive parameter parser in Apache NiFi was logging parsed property descriptor values for debugging purposes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive property values were being exposed in the debug logs. Specifically, literal values entered into a sensitive property were logged when no parameter was present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the debug logs could potentially obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, API keys, or other confidential data entered as property values.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access the debug log files of the NiFi instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to read the application's debug logs. This could involve having access to the server where NiFi is running or obtaining the logs through other means (e.g., compromised logging system).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability existed in Apache NiFi version 1.10.0 and was fixed in version 1.11.0.
- The fix involved removing the debug logging of parsed property descriptor values from the class.
- The provided content includes a link to the related Jira issue NIFI-6948 and the GitHub pull request #3935 which addresses the vulnerability.
