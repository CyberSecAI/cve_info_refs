Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1751:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `sourceware.org` explicitly mentions "Array overflow in backtrace on powerpc (CVE-2020-1751)". This confirms that the vulnerability relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an array overflow within the `backtrace` function of the `glibc` library on PowerPC architectures.
- Specifically, when unwinding through a signal frame, the `backtrace` function didn't properly check array bounds while storing the frame address, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- This was introduced by commit d400dcac5e which aimed to fix handling signal trampolines.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Array overflow: The code writes beyond the allocated boundaries of an array due to lack of bounds checking.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to the crash of the affected process.
- There is also a potential for arbitrary code execution due to the out-of-bounds write, though this is not confirmed.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when the `backtrace` function is called on a PowerPC system while unwinding through a signal frame.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Attackers must be able to trigger a signal handler or cause a backtrace on a PowerPC system running a vulnerable version of glibc.
- This could be achieved via local execution.

**7. Additional Technical Details:**

- The `sourceware.org` bug report mentions that commit d400dcac5e ("PowerPC: fix backtrace to handle signal trampolines") introduced the vulnerability
- The fix involved adding array bound checks before storing frame addresses during unwinding from a signal frame
- The vulnerability was fixed in glibc version 2.31 and backported to several older versions
- Patches were also applied to the `release/2.30/master`, `release/2.29/master`, `release/2.28/master`, and `release/2.26/master` branches.
- Red Hat marks this as a security issue as function call writes beyond the bounds of the input array given the size

**8. Netapp content:**
- NetApp's advisory for `CVE-2020-1751` (NTAP-20200430-0002) confirms the vulnerability in the glibc library used in multiple NetApp products.
- NetApp lists the affected products: Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere, Brocade Fabric Operating System Firmware, NetApp Cloud Backup, NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller, and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage.
- NetApp also provides a list of non affected products including ONTAP, ONTAP Mediator, and multiple hardware components.
- NetApp indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- They provide the CVSS v3 score of 5.1 with vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
- NetApp mentions that patches are available for some products. They also provide the link where patches can be found for affected products, and a method to contact support for assistance.
- The provided NetApp Advisory confirms the issue is applicable to NetApp products.

**9. Ubuntu Content**
- Ubuntu Security Notice (USN) `USN-4416-1` addresses `CVE-2020-1751` along with other glibc vulnerabilities.
- The USN states "It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain signal trampolines on PowerPC. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code."
- The USN lists the affected package: `libc6`
- The USN lists fix versions for Ubuntu 19.10, 18.04, and 16.04

**10. Gentoo Content**
- Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA) `202006-04` addresses `CVE-2020-1751` along with other glibc vulnerabilities.
- The GLSA states "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in glibc, the worst of which could result in a Denial of Service condition."
- The GLSA lists the affected package: `sys-libs/glibc`
- The GLSA lists the fixed version of `glibc`: `2.30-r8`
- The GLSA mentions that there is no known workaround at the time.
- The GLSA lists multiple bugzilla entries that are related to the vulnerability.

**11. RedHat Content**
- Red Hat Bugzilla bug 1810719 indicates that it is a security issue which "would write beyond the bounds of the input array given the size."
- The bug is marked as "CLOSED ERRATA"
- RedHat lists the vulnerability as affecting glibc
- RedHat states this issue has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
- RedHat provides a link to their security advisory which includes CVE-2020-1751: `https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A4444`

**Summary of extracted information:**

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1751
