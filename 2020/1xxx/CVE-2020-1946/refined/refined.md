  "CVE-2020-1946": {
    "description": "Malicious rule configuration files can be configured to run system commands",
    "affected_products": [
      "spamassassin"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how SpamAssassin handles certain configuration files (CF files). Specifically, malicious rule configuration files can be crafted to execute arbitrary commands.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of rule configuration files",
         "Arbitrary command execution vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the SpamAssassin process.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could entice a user or automated system to process a specially crafted CF file, possibly by downloading from a malicious update server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious CF file to the spamassassin process.  This could be achieved by setting up a malicious update server, or tricking users into loading a malicious file."
