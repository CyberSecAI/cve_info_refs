{
  "CVE-2020-1167": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of GLB files due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user at low integrity.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a malicious GLB file",
       "Visiting a malicious page hosting a malicious GLB file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "User interaction is required; the target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page. An attacker needs to craft a malicious GLB file with user-supplied data exceeding the buffer's capacity."
