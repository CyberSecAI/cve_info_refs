{
  "CVE-2020-1464": {
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Windows handles digital signatures for MSI files. The `MsiSIPVerifyIndirectData` function only checks if the beginning of the file is a valid MSI file and verifies its signature, ignoring any data appended to the end.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of file format",
      "Ignoring appended data after signature verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can append malicious code (like a Java JAR executable) to a signed MSI file, and it would still be considered valid by Windows. This allows the attacker to bypass security features and execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted MSI files",
      "Appending a JAR file containing malicious code to an MSI file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a valid MSI file and append a malicious JAR file. This can then be distributed to a victim for execution."
  }
