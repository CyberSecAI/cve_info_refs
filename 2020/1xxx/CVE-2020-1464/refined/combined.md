**Code signing** is the process of digitally [signing](/wiki/Digital_signatures_and_law "Digital signatures and law") [executables](/wiki/Executable "Executable") and [scripts](/wiki/Scripting_language "Scripting language") to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. The process employs the use of a [cryptographic hash](/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function "Cryptographic hash function") to validate authenticity and integrity.[[1]](#cite_note-1) Code signing was invented in 1995 by Michael Doyle, as part of the [Eolas](/wiki/Eolas "Eolas") WebWish browser plug-in, which enabled the use of public-key cryptography to sign downloadable Web app program code using a secret key, so the plug-in code interpreter could then use the corresponding public key to authenticate the code before allowing it access to the code interpreter's APIs. [[2]](#cite_note-2)

Code signing can provide several valuable features. The most common use of code signing is to provide security when deploying; in some programming languages, it can also be used to help prevent namespace conflicts. Almost every code signing implementation will provide some sort of digital signature mechanism to verify the identity of the author or build system, and a [checksum](/wiki/Checksum "Checksum") to verify that the object has not been modified. It can also be used to provide versioning information about an object or to store other [metadata](/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") about an object.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

The efficacy of code signing as an authentication mechanism for software depends on the security of underpinning signing keys. As with other [public key infrastructure (PKI)](/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure "Public key infrastructure") technologies, the integrity of the system relies on publishers securing their private keys against unauthorized access. Keys stored in software on general-purpose computers are susceptible to compromise. Therefore, it is more secure, and best practice, to store keys in secure, tamper-proof, cryptographic hardware devices known as hardware security modules or [HSMs](/wiki/Hardware_security_module "Hardware security module").[[4]](#cite_note-4)

## Providing security

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Providing security")]

Many code signing implementations will provide a way to sign the code using a system involving a pair of keys, one public and one private, similar to the process employed by [TLS](/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") or [SSH](/wiki/Secure_Shell "Secure Shell"). For example, in the case of .NET, the developer uses a private key to sign their libraries or executables each time they build. This key will be unique to a developer or group or sometimes per application or object. The developer can either generate this key on their own or obtain one from a trusted [certificate authority](/wiki/Certificate_authority "Certificate authority") (CA).[[5]](#cite_note-5)

Code signing is particularly valuable in distributed environments, where the source of a given piece of code may not be immediately evident - for example [Java applets](/wiki/Java_applet "Java applet"), [ActiveX](/wiki/ActiveX "ActiveX") controls and other active web and browser scripting code. Another important usage is to safely provide updates and patches to existing software.[[6]](#cite_note-6) [Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"), [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X "Mac OS X"), and most [Linux distributions](/wiki/Linux_distributions "Linux distributions") provide updates using code signing to ensure that it is not possible for others to maliciously distribute code via the patch system. It allows the receiving operating system to verify that the update is legitimate, even if the update was delivered by third parties or physical media (disks).[[7]](#cite_note-7)

Code signing is used on Windows and Mac OS X to authenticate software on [first run](/w/index.php?title=First_run_(computing)&action=edit&redlink=1 "First run (computing) (page does not exist)"), ensuring that the software has not been maliciously tampered with by a third-party distributor or download site. This form of code signing is not used on Linux because of that platform's decentralized nature, the [package manager](/wiki/Package_manager "Package manager") being the predominant mode of distribution for all forms of software (not just updates and patches), as well as the [open-source model](/wiki/Open-source_model "Open-source model") allowing direct inspection of the source code if desired. [Debian](/wiki/Debian "Debian")-based Linux distributions (among others) validate downloaded packages using public key cryptography.[[8]](#cite_note-8)

### Trusted identification using a certificate authority (CA)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Trusted identification using a certificate authority (CA)")]

The [public key](/wiki/Public_key "Public key") used to authenticate the code signature should be traceable back to a trusted root authority CA, preferably using a secure [public key infrastructure](/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure "Public key infrastructure") (PKI). This does not ensure that the code itself can be trusted, only that it comes from the stated source (or more explicitly, from a particular [private key](/wiki/Private_key "Private key")).[[9]](#cite_note-9) A CA provides a root trust level and is able to assign trust to others by proxy. If a user trusts a CA, then the user can presumably trust the legitimacy of code that is signed with a key generated by that CA or one of its proxies. Many operating systems and frameworks contain built-in trust for one or more certification authorities. It is also commonplace for large organizations to implement a private CA, internal to the organization, which provides the same features as public CAs, but it is only trusted within the organization.

### Extended validation (EV) code signing

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Extended validation (EV) code signing")]

[Extended validation](/wiki/Extended_validation "Extended validation") (EV) code signing certificates are subject to additional validation and technical requirements. These guidelines are based on the CA/B Forum's Baseline Requirements and Extended Validation Guidelines. In addition to validation requirements specific to EV, the EV code signing guidelines stipulate that "the Subscriber's private key is generated, stored and used in a crypto module that meets or exceeds the requirements of FIPS 140-2 level 2."[[10]](#cite_note-10)

Certain applications, such as signing Windows 10 kernel-mode drivers, require an EV code signing certificate.[[11]](#cite_note-11) Additionally, Microsoft's IEBlog states that Windows programs "signed by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation with [SmartScreen](/wiki/SmartScreen "SmartScreen") reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that
file or publisher."[[12]](#cite_note-12)

#### Sample EV code signing certificate

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Sample EV code signing certificate")]

This is an example of a decoded EV code signing certificate used by SSL.com to sign software. `SSL.com EV Code Signing Intermediate CA RSA R3` is shown as the Issuer's commonName, identifying this as an EV code signing certificate. The certificate's `Subject` field describes SSL Corp as an organization. `Code Signing` is shown as the sole X509v3 Extended Key Usage.

### Alternative to CAs

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Alternative to CAs")]

The other model is the [trust on first use](/wiki/Trust_on_first_use "Trust on first use") model, in which developers can choose to provide their own self-generated key. In this scenario, the user would normally have to obtain the public key in some fashion directly from the developer to verify the object is from them for the first time. Many code signing systems will store the public key inside the signature. Some software frameworks and OSs that check the code's signature before executing will allow you to choose to trust that developer from that point on after the first run. An application developer can provide a similar system by including the public keys with the installer. The key can then be used to ensure that any subsequent objects that need to run, such as upgrades, plugins, or another application, are all verified as coming from that same developer.

### Time-stamping

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Time-stamping")]

Time-stamping was designed to circumvent the trust warning that will appear in the case of an expired certificate. In effect, time-stamping extends the code trust beyond the validity period of a certificate.[[13]](#cite_note-morton-13)

In the event that a certificate has to be revoked due to a compromise, a specific date and time of the compromising event will become part of the revocation record. In this case, time-stamping helps establish whether the code was signed before or after the certificate was compromised.[[13]](#cite_note-morton-13)

### Code signing in [Xcode](/wiki/Xcode "Xcode")

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Code signing in Xcode")]

Developers need to sign their [iOS](/wiki/IOS "IOS") and tvOS apps before running them on any real device and before uploading them to the [App Store](/wiki/App_Store_%28iOS%29 "App Store (iOS)"). This is needed to prove that the developer owns a valid Apple Developer ID. An application needs a valid profile or certificate so that it can run on the devices.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

### Problems

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Problems")]

Like any security measure, code signing can be defeated. Users can be tricked into running unsigned code, or even into running code that refuses to validate, and the system only remains secure as long as the private key remains private.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16)

It is also important to note that code signing does not protect the end user from any malicious activity or unintentional software bugs by the software author — it merely ensures that the software has not been modified by anyone other than the author. Sometimes, sandbox systems do not accept certificates, because of a false time-stamp or because of an excess usage of [RAM](/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random-access memory").

## Implementations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Implementations")]

Microsoft implements a form of code signing (based on Authenticode) provided for Microsoft tested drivers. Since drivers run in the kernel, they can destabilize the system or open the system to security holes. For this reason, Microsoft tests drivers submitted to its [WHQL program](/wiki/WHQL_Testing "WHQL Testing"). After the driver has passed, Microsoft signs that version of the driver as being safe. On 32-bit systems only, installing drivers that are not validated with Microsoft is possible after agreeing to allow the installation at a prompt warning the user that the code is unsigned. For .NET (managed) code, there is an additional mechanism called [Strong Name Signing](/wiki/Strong_key "Strong key") that uses Public/Private keys and [SHA](/wiki/SHA-1 "SHA-1")-1 hash as opposed to certificates. However, Microsoft discourages reliance on Strong Name Signing as a replacement for Authenticode.[[17]](#cite_note-17)

The Code Signing Working Group of the CA/Browser Forum decided that starting June 1, 2023, all code signing certificates (not only the EA ones) should mandate private key storage on a physical media, such as in a hardware crypto module conforming to at least FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or Common Criteria EAL 4+.[[18]](#cite_note-baselinereq-18) The CAs subsequently issued announcements on compliance with the decision.[[19]](#cite_note-19)[[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22)[[23]](#cite_note-23)[[24]](#cite_note-24)[[25]](#cite_note-25)

## Unsigned code in gaming and consumer devices

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Code_signing&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Unsigned code in gaming and consumer devices")]

In the context of consumer devices such as [games consoles](/wiki/Handheld_game_console "Handheld game console"), the term "unsigned code" is often used to refer to an application which has not been signed with the [cryptographic key](/wiki/Key_%28cryptography%29 "Key (cryptography)") normally required for software to be accepted and executed. Most console games have to be signed with a secret key designed by the console maker or the game will not load on the console (both to enforce [Vendor lock-in](/wiki/Vendor_lock-in "Vendor lock-in") and combat software piracy). There are several methods to get unsigned code to execute which include software [exploits](/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29 "Exploit (computer security)"), the use of a [modchip](/wiki/Modchip "Modchip"), a technique known as the swap trick or running a [softmod](/wiki/Softmod "Softmod").

It may not initially seem obvious why simply copying a signed application onto another DVD does not allow it to boot. On the [Xbox](/wiki/Xbox_%28console%29 "Xbox (console)"), the reason for this is that the Xbox executable file (XBE) contains a media-type flag, which specifies the type of media that the XBE is bootable from. On nearly all Xbox software, this is set such that the executable will only boot from factory-produced discs, so simply copying the executable to burnable media is enough to stop the execution of the software.

However, since the executable is signed, simply changing the value of the flag is not possible as this alters the signature of the executable, causing it to fail validation when checked.

Residents across the United States are being inundated with text messages purporting to come from toll road operators like E-ZPass, warning that recipients face fines if a delinquent toll fee remains unpaid. Researchers say the surge in SMS spam coincides with new features added to a popular commercial phishing kit sold in China that makes it simple to set up convincing lures spoofing toll road operators in multiple U.S. states.

Besieged by scammers seeking to phish user accounts over the telephone, Apple and Google frequently caution that they will never reach out unbidden to users this way. However, new details about the internal operations of a prolific voice phishing gang show the group routinely abuses legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.

Federal authorities have arrested and indicted a 20-year-old U.S. Army soldier on suspicion of being Kiberphant0m, a cybercriminal who has been selling and leaking sensitive customer call records stolen earlier this year from AT&T and Verizon. As first reported by KrebsOnSecurity last month, the accused is a communications specialist who was recently stationed in South Korea.

Cybercriminals are selling hundreds of thousands of credential sets stolen with the help of a cracked version of Acunetix, a powerful commercial web app vulnerability scanner, new research finds. The cracked software is being resold as a cloud-based attack tool by at least two different services, one of which KrebsOnSecurity traced to an information technology firm based in Turkey.

Adam Griffin is still in disbelief over how quickly he was robbed of nearly $500,000 in cryptocurrencies. A scammer called using a real Google phone number to warn his Gmail account was being hacked, sent email security alerts directly from google.com, and ultimately seized control over the account by convincing him to click “yes” to a Google prompt on his mobile device.

A financial firm registered in Canada has emerged as the payment processor for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers, new research finds. Meanwhile, an investigation into the Vancouver street address used by this company shows it is home to dozens of foreign currency dealers, money transfer businesses, and cryptocurrency exchanges — none of which are physically located there.

Phishing attacks increased nearly 40 percent in the year ending August 2024, with much of that growth concentrated at a small number of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) — such as .shop, .top, .xyz — that attract scammers with rock-bottom prices and no meaningful registration requirements, new research finds. Meanwhile, the nonprofit entity that oversees the domain name industry is moving forward with plans to introduce a slew of new gTLDs.

Two men have been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that used the cloud data storage company Snowflake, but a third suspect — a prolific hacker known as Kiberphant0m — remains at large and continues to publicly extort victims. However, this person’s identity may not remain a secret for long: A careful review of Kiberphant0m’s daily chats across multiple cybercrime personas suggests they are a U.S. Army soldier who is or was recently stationed in South Korea.

In December 2023, KrebsOnSecurity revealed the real-life identity of Rescator, the nickname used by a Russian cybercriminal who sold more than 100 million payment cards stolen from Target and Home Depot between 2013 and 2014. Moscow resident Mikhail Shefel, who confirmed using the Rescator identity in a recent interview, also admitted reaching out because he is broke and seeking publicity for several new money making schemes.

Digitally signed files are more trusted by the Operating System. This higher trust allows such files to execute in sensitive contexts or excluded from Antivirus scans. Consequently, attackers are trying to spoof these digital certificates to gain these extended privileges for their malicious code.

Earlier this year, [Peleg Hadar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peleghd/?originalSubdomain=il) and I worked together on some aspects of the [CurveBall attack](/zengo/win10-crypto-vulnerability-cheating-in-elliptic-curve-billiards-2-69b45f2dcab6), a “spoofing bug” which allowed attackers to abuse a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft Windows implementation to pass their malicious network traffic and files as validly signed.

Therefore, when Peleg started to analyze last week’s “Windows’ patch Tuesday”’s [CVE-2020–1464](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1464) , described by [Brian Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/cve-2020-1464/) as:

> a “spoofing” bug in virtually all supported versions of Windows

he had asked me to look into the cryptographic aspects of this new vulnerability. **We soon realized that this vulnerability is not only not cryptographic, but also not new!**

In this article, we try to sew the fragmented pieces of information about this vulnerability, we internally call GlueBall, into a cohesive story.

# GlueBall Timeline

* **August 2018:** A GlueBall sample was [first uploaded](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/dd71284ac6be9758a5046740168164ae76f743579e24929e0a840afd6f2d0d8e/details) to VirusTotal. According to author, [Bernardo Quintero](https://twitter.com/bquintero),he immediately reported the issue to Microsoft

August 2018: A GlueBall sample was [uploaded](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/dd71284ac6be9758a5046740168164ae76f743579e24929e0a840afd6f2d0d8e/details) to VirusTotal

* **January 2019**: VirusTotal [published an analysis](https://blog.virustotal.com/2019/01/distribution-of-malicious-jar-appended.html) of GlueBall core issue, after Microsoft understood the issue, added some support to it on external tools, but said they “WONT FIX” for the operating system.
* **January 2019:** Following the VirusTotal blog, [Multiple](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/01/16/thoughts-on-the-msi-jar-authenticode-bypass/) [blog](/forensicitguy/making-meterpreter-look-google-signed-using-msi-jar-files-c0a7970ff8b7) posts on using GlueBall to hide malicious content were published.
* **June 2020:** Following some in the wild exploitation with popular malware, GlueBall was “re-discovered” and highlighted by social media

* **August 2020:** Microsoft [patched](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1464) GlueBall, 2 years after it was first discovered in the wild.

# GlueBall explained

Windows trust architecture is quite cumbersome and not well documented. SpecterOps’ [Matt Graeber](https://twitter.com/mattifestation?lang=en) had explored it in the detail in his epic “[Subverting Trust in Windows](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/SpecterOps_Subverting_Trust_in_Windows.pdf)” paper. Specifically, it details the functions that allow Windows to treat different kinds of files in a different manner.

![]()

The VerifyIndirectData function is used to verify the integrity of a specific file format (source: [SpecterOps](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/SpecterOps_Subverting_Trust_in_Windows.pdf))

The problematic function in GlueBall’s case was MsiSIPVerifyIndirectData, used to verify the contents of Microsoft Installer (MSI) files.

As described in the VirusTotal [original blog,](https://blog.virustotal.com/2019/01/distribution-of-malicious-jar-appended.html) the MSI verification function only checks that the **beginning of the file is a valid MSI file and verifies its signature. If there is data beyond that, it is ignored.**

As a result, attackers could append any data they want to the end of a signed MSI, and still have this file considered as verified by Windows. This trust bypass was made exploitable by appending a Java JAR executable to the end of the MSI. JAR files are evaluated **from their end**, thus creating a perfect malicious tandem:

* JAR execution is evaluated from file end, ignoring a possible prefix.
* MSI signatures verification is from file start, ignoring a possible suffix.

**Consequently a malicious GlueBall file is both verified and executable!**

As expected, the solution is quite simple. The patched MsiSIPVerifyIndirectData function checks for the size of the MSI and fails if it contains an unexpected suffix

![]()

Patched MsiSIPVerifyIndirectData() verifies the file’s size too (source: [Peleg’s twitter](https://twitter.com/peleghd/status/1294962689127702535?s=20))

In the GIF below, the same GlueBall file, comprised of an MSI and JAR is shown to be considered as validly signed on unpatched systems and invalid on patched systems.

Same GlueBall file: digital signature valid on an unpatched computer, but invalid on a patched computer

# Parting thoughts

While the technical details are pretty obvious, the way Microsoft had handled the vulnerability report seems rather strange. It was very clear to everyone involved, Microsoft included, that GlueBall is indeed a valid vulnerability exploited in the wild. Therefore, it is not clear why it was only patched now and not two years ago.

***Update August 17, 2020****: timeline updated.*

## [Distribution of malicious JAR appended to MSI files signed by third parties](https://blog.virustotal.com/2019/01/distribution-of-malicious-jar-appended.html)

Microsoft Windows keeps the Authenticode signature valid after appending any content to the end of Windows Installer (.MSI) files signed by any software developer. This behaviour can be exploited by attackers to bypass some security solutions that rely on Microsoft Windows code signing to decide if files are trusted. The scenario is especially dangerous when the appended code is a malicious JAR because the resulting file has a valid signature according to Microsoft Windows and the malware can be directly executed by Java.

Code signing is the method of using a certificate-based digital signature to sign executables and scripts in order to verify the author's identity and ensure that the code has not been changed or corrupted since it was signed by the author.[1] This way, for example, if you modify the content or append any data to a signed Windows PE (.EXE) file the signature of the resulting file will not be valid for Microsoft Windows, as expected. This behaviour changes when you append any data to the end of a signed Windows Installer (.MSI), the resulting file will pass the verification process of Microsoft Windows and will show just the original signature as valid without any other warning.

This behaviour could be used to hide and distribute malicious code in MSI signed files, in fact several security solutions rely on the output of Microsoft Windows code signing validation to avoid an in-depth scan when the file has a valid signature by a well-known and trusted software developer. Such an attack vector is not very interesting if the resulting file is not designed to execute the attached payload, because the attacker would need an additional component already running in the target to extract and execute the appended malicious code. However, JAR files have a characteristic that allows them to run directly in this scenario, making them the perfect candidate to take advantage of this situation.

A JAR file allows Java runtimes to efficiently deploy an entire application, including its classes and their associated resources, in a single request.[2] The interesting part for exploiting the commented scenario is the JAR file format is based on ZIP to store the different components and resources, and this kind of ZIP is correctly identified by the presence of an end of central directory record which is located at the end of the archive to allow the easy appending of new files.[3] When Java opens a JAR file it looks at the end instead of the beginning of the file, so a JAR file is executed independently of the data at the beginning of the file. In addition, on Microsoft Windows systems, the Java Runtime Environment's installation program will register a default association for JAR files so that double-clicking a JAR file on the desktop will automatically run it with "javaw -jar". Dependent extensions bundled with the application will also be loaded automatically. This feature makes the end-user runtime environment easier to use on Microsoft Windows systems.[4]

In short, an attacker can append a malicious JAR to a MSI file signed by a trusted software developer (like Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc. or any other well-known developer), and the resulting file can be renamed with the .jar extension and will have a valid signature according Microsoft Windows. For example, via the command "copy /b signed.msi + malicious.jar signed\_malicious.jar". The victim can be infected with just a double-click in such a file.

This attack vector was detected in a sample sent to VirusTotal and flagged by VirusTotal Monitor (a service to detect and avoid false positives).[5] We have not found evidence of this technique being used massively to distribute malware.

We would like to thank Mark Russinovich and Mark Cook from Microsoft for working with us in the study of the issue and their quick response with a Sysinternal's Sigcheck update to detect this kind of malformed files.[6] VirusTotal also detects this attack vector via the updated version of Sigcheck with the warning "Signed but the filesize is invalid (the file is too large)" in the Signature info section.[7]

Thanks also to Microsoft Security Response Center for the study of the issue. This attack vector has been verified in the latest and updated versions of Windows 10 and Java available at the timing of writing (Windows 10 Version 1809 and Java SE Runtime Environment 8 Update 191). Microsoft has decided that it will not be fixing this issue in the current versions of Windows and agreed we are able to blog about this case and our findings publicly.

Last but not least, thanks to all our security partners at VirusTotal for making Internet safer. An early version of this blog post has been shared with all of them in order to provide an adequate response to detect and stop these types of attacks with their antivirus, antimalware and next-gen solutions.

# Microsoft Put Off Fixing Zero Day for 2 Years

August 17, 2020

[53 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comments)

A security flaw in the way **Microsoft Windows** guards users against malicious files was actively exploited in malware attacks for two years before last week, when Microsoft finally issued a software update to correct the problem.

![](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zeroday.png)

One of the 120 security holes [Microsoft fixed on Aug. 11’s Patch Tuesday](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/) was [CVE-2020-1464](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1464), a problem with the way every supported version of Windows validates digital signatures for computer programs.

[Code signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing) is the method of using a certificate-based digital signature to sign executable files and scripts in order to verify the author’s identity and ensure that the code has not been changed or corrupted since it was signed by the author.

Microsoft said an attacker could use this “spoofing vulnerability” to bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. Microsoft’s advisory makes no mention of security researchers having told the company about the flaw, which Microsoft acknowledged was actively being exploited.

In fact, CVE-2020-1464 was first spotted in attacks used in the wild back in August 2018. And several researchers informed Microsoft about the weakness over the past 18 months.

**Bernardo Quintero** is the manager at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com), a service owned by Google that scans any submitted files against dozens of antivirus services and displays the results. On Jan. 15, 2019, Quintero [published a blog post](https://blog.virustotal.com/2019/01/distribution-of-malicious-jar-appended.html) outlining how Windows keeps the Authenticode signature valid after appending any content to the end of Windows Installer files (those ending in .MSI) signed by any software developer.

Quintero said this weakness would be particularly acute if an attacker were to use it to hide a malicious **Java** file (.jar). And, he said, this exact attack vector was indeed detected in a malware sample sent to VirusTotal.

“In short, an attacker can append a malicious JAR to a MSI file signed by a trusted software developer (like Microsoft Corporation, Google Inc. or any other well-known developer), and the resulting file can be renamed with the .jar extension and will have a valid signature according Microsoft Windows,” Quintero wrote.

But according to Quintero, while Microsoft’s security team validated his findings, the company chose not to address the problem at the time.

“Microsoft has decided that it will not be fixing this issue in the current versions of Windows and agreed we are able to blog about this case and our findings publicly,” his blog post concluded.

**Tal Be’ery**, founder of [Zengo](https://zengo.com/), and **Peleg Hadar**, senior security researcher at [SafeBreach Labs](https://safebreach.com/safebreach-labs), penned [a blog post on Sunday](https://medium.com/%40TalBeerySec/glueball-the-story-of-cve-2020-1464-50091a1f98bd) that pointed to a file uploaded to VirusTotal in August 2018 that abused the spoofing weakness, which has been dubbed **GlueBall**. The last time that August 2018 file was scanned at VirusTotal (Aug 14, 2020), it was [detected as a malicious Java trojan by 28 of 59 antivirus programs](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/dd71284ac6be9758a5046740168164ae76f743579e24929e0a840afd6f2d0d8e/detection).

More recently, others would likewise call attention to malware that abused the security weakness, including [this post in June 2020](https://www.securityinbits.com/malware-analysis/interesting-tactic-by-ratty-adwind-distribution-of-jar-appended-to-signed-msi/) from the **Security-in-bits** blog.

Be’ery said the way Microsoft has handled the vulnerability report seems rather strange.

“It was very clear to everyone involved, Microsoft included, that GlueBall is indeed a valid vulnerability exploited in the wild,” he wrote. “Therefore, it is not clear why it was only patched now and not two years ago.”

Asked to comment on why it waited two years to patch a flaw that was actively being exploited to compromise the security of Windows computers, Microsoft dodged the question, saying Windows users who have applied the latest security updates are protected from this attack.

“A security update was released in August,” Microsoft said in a written statement sent to KrebsOnSecurity. “Customers who apply the update, or have automatic updates enabled, will be protected. We continue to encourage customers to turn on automatic updates to help ensure they are protected.”

**Update, 12:45 a.m. ET:** Corrected attribution on the June 2020 blog article about GlueBall exploits in the wild.

   Arrogance coupled with Stupidity. Must be nice to be a billion dollar corp with the immunity of giant corporate walls. Long ago Microsoft “should” have been forced by the US Gov to take responsibility for all the trouble their vulnerable software has caused.

      What’s to say it wasn’t being actively used by the government? I think they should port this patch backwards to those who have Windows7 machines, since it was a known exploit at that time.

         That was my reaction too, the comment “Customers who apply the update, or have automatic updates enabled, will be protected” should continue with “unless you’re running Windows 7”, which is out of support now but was very much in support when Microsoft became aware of this.

      “TheFed

      Well said – I wish that they had been my words. I am sick and tired of Microsoft’s attitude to us mere mortals. I still do not have the courage to Update my Win8.1 from last August-October Update fiscos. With no apologies or recompence for the losses that their CRAP updates caused to my desktop at that time.

         Give Linux a try if you don’t like windows. It has its issues but it’s a lot better.

         Why are you still using Windows? Its a horrorshow. Everyone knows it. Linux is far superior in quality, usability, and common sense, in addition to security.

            Linux more usable than Windows? I can’t believe that someone actually a) said that and b) believes that…and not necessarily in that order.

      It is blatantly obvious that some (US ?) Gov agency are behind this ! Dodging the question as they did is sooooo unprofessional that it ought to be suspicious !

   2 years ago they would have had to update Windows 7 and 8 before going to Windows 10. Now they can disregard any users other then Windows 10 users and shirk their responsibility to everyone else. That sucks!
5. Dennis [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515450)

   They treat security researchers quite badly. My friend and I submitted several vulnerabilities to them with several pages of PDF documentation and a working PoC. And we received a one sentence reply that they thanked us and that they will forward it to the correct dept. The bottom line – it’s still not fixed. Probably 6 months after. So, Pretty much the same story. My guess is that there are so many vulns in their OS that they pick only the worst remove code execs. The rest is swept under the rug.

   My gut hunch: Because patching it immediately would likely have required crippling the very heart & soul of what Microsoft is in business for: making sure everyone has paid up! And now they have finally replaced that core with an updated method
9. PHP [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515454)

   Surely by request by NSA.

   Security services needs backdoors. If they can not get Microsoft to put them in, maybe they can get them to delay patching.

      Concur.

      Yeah, that’s a bit tinfoil hat, but given the craziness in the world over the last few years, I’m a gonna say, “Yup”.

         OK, Phil, I’ll bite! What is “the craziness in the world over the last few years” and how does it relates to this or these issues?

         Huh?

    What I would like to know is why every new windows PC has expired security certificate’s installed, even a brand new oem windows o.s. disk will install expired certificate’s. Even brand new Android phone’s has expired certificate’s installed from the factory. I’m my opinion every windows PC and Android has security holes before you purchase.

       Expired certs does not present a security flaw. It just means the services checking them will throw out valid requests until the certs are updated. You clearly have no clue how certificates work.

       Expired Certs don’t pose a threat. Still weird that they’re there

          No, certificates may still be part of s valid chain of trust. When you sign code, this is the reason you countersign with a timestamp server, so that even when your certificate expires, the signature was and therefore is still valid.

    No one ever thinks that maybe the (insert multi-letter agency) were hamstringing Microsoft into not performing the update because they were actively using the vulnerability to exploit and spy on an active TOI at the cost of civilian security?

    You don’t actually believe a windows install needs to be over 6 GB ?

    1. Doubtist [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515490)

       I tend to believe a more mundane explanation is equally likely.

       Like OEM/3rd party enterprises/vendors using invalid sigs or just ignoring the issue for so long that going back to fix all the critical .msi’s over the decades with proper sigs would be more work than the actual security afforded in the minor method.

       Many Linux distributions require similar storage space as Windows. It’s not Windows taking up a lot of space. Operating Systems taking up more drive space. Ubuntu 20.04 out of the box takes up a similar amount. Some other non-light-weight distributions take up similar amounts once you get them set up.

    Consequences of stupid society.

    There is today excellent open source alternatives to microsoft for both corporate as personal users but Microsoft keep existing. The problem is due to common laziness mixed with pure stupidity giving this kind of companies an existence.

    Microsoft offers fair to poor service to customers – not news. Frustration and at times anger wells up but changes nothing. Calls for government regulation requires a broken agency to improve a broken agency. How about not using MS anymore? Stop using MS O/S and hardware products. Tell Microsft you stopped and send a copy of a receipt that shows you stopped. Customers have the power to bring change. If you do nothing that is exactly what will change.

    The feature has been replaced with another one.

    usa is only country where the fraud and scams are existing

    usa security system is from windows 90s lol

    europe and the rest of the world is all ready ahead usa still behind

    its what usa cant hire guys who will make secure it system??

    or what is the problem?

    guys update you it and everybody can sleep well

    If this were made public and patched while Windows 7 was still in support, they would have had to patch it too… which might have been different/more difficult than only addressing Win10

    Waiting until Win7 reached EoL means they dont have to develop fixes for it…. much easier since you only have to support 1/2 the versions.

    You just have to let your users sit exposed to a critical vulnerability for a couple years, then you can save yourself some dev time.
27. Winston [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515482)

    “We continue to encourage customers to turn on automatic updates to help ensure they are protected.”

    Doesn’t do much good if Microsoft doesn’t provide a patch for two years, thereby allowing two years for a machine to be compromised with malware with “official” ring zero permission.
29. Elliott [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515483)

    Many here are quick to judge, but I suspect that there’s more to it than, arrogance or stupidity on Microsoft’s part. Think what you want. They supply fixes every month, just as every other software entity does, so why not this one?

    “Be’ery said the way Microsoft has handled the vulnerability report seems rather strange.”

    Perhaps it might be worth pausing the knee-jerk once in a while and think for a moment.

    The examples of the exploit that are cited here are using Java. Everyone reading Krebs has removed Java, right?

    1. Elliott [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515512)

       I’m pretty sure that I just asked for conspiracy theories.

       I’m sorry.
31. Steve [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515487)

    Elliot is right – I don’t see an actual vulnerability here.

    The claim is that the resulting file “will have a valid signature according Microsoft Windows” but the screenshot only shows a valid signature being reported by Windows Explorer. Explorer != Windows. Explorer isn’t even automatically trusted by the rest of the operating system (it can’t be, because otherwise malware could easily take control of it.)

    I don’t think I’ve \_ever\_ looked at that tab. It rarely, if ever, contains useful information.

    The only “vulnerability” I can see here is that an ignorant \_human\_ might look at the file properties of a .jar, see a digital signature, and incorrectly conclude that the .jar was signed by whomever. That is undesirable, and I would definitely classify it as a bug, but that’s not a software vulnerability, that’s a human vulnerability (ignorance of the limitations of the .jar format, and the details underpinning the Digital Signatures tab on the property sheed.)

    Unless the presence of such a signature allowed a .jar to be executed when Group Policy would otherwise have blocked it, it’s not a vulnerability in the operating system itself.
33. John [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515492)

    Does the JRE allow the file vs signature mismatch or Windows which allows the JRE to run a jar with a mismatch ?

    In any case, the problem appears to be allowing the size mismatch. How hard could this have been to fix.
35. JJ [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515494)

    Two possible explanations:

    – idiocy, in the typical MS vein

    – covering for the NSA that was actively using that exploit and needed to find a new one before MS plugged it (maybe NSA didn’t find a new one and MS said, sorry, two years is enough, or maybe the NSA found a new one)

    1. Catwhisperer [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515509)

       That was my thought, that the vulnerability was being used by clandestine services…

       1. doubtist [August 31, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-516306)

          But they wouldn’t need it. Let’s face it, this is a weak vuln.

          Code signing spoof tricks ONE aspect of Windows, and only one, at time of software installation. The user is involved also.

          Believe you me, the NSA’s ability to alter your windows install does not rely on the user clicking “proceed” in actuality after manually starting an install containing an exploit.

          It’s low-lying fruit for 3rd parties to hit enterprise chains though.
37. Rando [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515496)

    Just a small note, the picture they used on their twitter account is…very incorrect. The file command uses file headers, which is why it says msi file, and it’s correct, because the top of the file is an msi file. The bug in the signature algorithm is that it stops after it verifies the msi file and it seems to do so because of the headers it sees and ignores the extension, but the file execution handler is based on the extension, not the headers.

    The reason why zip files being read from bottom to top is important is because prepending an msi file will not make a jar file invalid, but the ordering has nothing to do with how the file is executed. If you didn’t append the jar file, the jre would just say the file was invalid and it would not execute the msi file.
39. MattK [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515499)

    If MS isn’t going to bother to fix them and then stop reporting them, just release them directly to the wild.

    1. Hmm, [August 31, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-516307)

       The collateral damage from that approach could kill economies.
41. Alex [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515500)

    Some popular product installers use this “capability” to improve user experience for an installer… for example if you want to pass some sort of token to an installer it is allowed based on this mechanism . Quite a few companies use this trick that’s been around since 2000s to give you an install links (MSI or EXE for Windows) that automatically come logged in and know which user it is doing the install. Basically you sign your software with EV authenticode signature but you are allowed to append some data outside of the signed envelope. Everyone from Dropbox to GoToMeeting and many other conferencing solutions have used this for years and there are still legitimate reason for doing so.

    I assume Microsoft didn’t want to break compatibility for a lot of users very quickly. E.g Dropbox stopped doing this around a year or two ago but many still do it. Not sure if this patch breaks this or what…
43. Someone [August 17, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515505)

    So basically, the major vulnerability was that JAR files have no validation checking.

    The first two bytes of a ZIP (and by extension) and JAR files should always be “PK”.

    It would also be ridiculously easy to include malware scanner signatures to detect this. Probably why it was so low on the priority list.

    I’d say the reason MS waited is simple.. by waiting they got to avoid patching a massive bundle of OS versions that are now “not supported” and can also push the “you have to use 10 to be secure” mantra now they have released it in the hope of pushing another % of people over to the mess that is 10 (we’ll never release another version, expect all the versions of 10)

       Lol, never fear, im sure W11 will be saas only. You wont need to worry about your data being stolen when giving it all to Microsoft becomes a required feature anyway.
49. Dion [August 19, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515622)

    Can’t redpill people enough to step away from Microsoft and use a different operating system rather than Windows because it’s full of holes and this proves it again
51. Svein Terje [August 24, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515881)

    Apparently, according to Security Now (podcast), the reason they did not fix it may have been that they are using it for themselves to append files relating to supporting different languages/cultures, but guess it’s just speculation.
53. Dukki7 [August 24, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/#comment-515887)

    Maybe people would trust Microsoft more if every single update didn’t reset all my privacy settings to open and reinstall Edge.

# Microsoft Patch Tuesday, August 2020 Edition

August 11, 2020

[49 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comments)

**Microsoft** today released updates to plug at least 120 security holes in its **Windows** operating systems and supported software, including two newly discovered vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited. Yes, good people of the Windows world, it’s time once again to backup and patch up!

![](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png)

The most concerning of these appears to be [CVE-2020-1380](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1380), which is a weaknesses in **Internet Explorer** that could result in system compromise just by browsing with IE to a hacked or malicious website. Microsoft’s advisory says this flaw is currently being exploited in active attacks.

The other flaw enjoying active exploitation is [CVE-2020-1464](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1464), which is a “spoofing” bug in virtually all supported versions of Windows that allows an attacker to bypass Windows security features and load improperly signed files. For more on this flaw, see [Microsoft Put Off Fixing Zero for 2 Years](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-put-off-fixing-zero-day-for-2-years/).

**Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative** points to another fix — [CVE-2020-1472](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472) — which involves a critical issue in **Windows Server** versions that could let an unauthenticated attacker gain administrative access to a Windows domain controller and run an application of their choosing. A domain controller is a server that responds to security authentication requests in a Windows environment, and a compromised domain controller can give attackers the keys to the kingdom inside a corporate network.

“It’s rare to see a Critical-rated elevation of privilege bug, but this one deserves it,” said ZDI’S **Dustin Childs**. “What’s worse is that there is not a full fix available.”

Perhaps the most “[elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet)” vulnerability addressed this month earned the distinction of being named [CVE-2020-1337](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1337), and refers to a security hole in the **Windows Print Spooler** service that could allow an attacker or malware to escalate their privileges on a system if they were already logged on as a regular (non-administrator) user.

**Satnam Narang** at **Tenable** notes that CVE-2020-1337 is a patch bypass for [CVE-2020-1048](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1048), another Windows Print Spooler vulnerability that was patched in May 2020. Narang said researchers found that the patch for CVE-2020-1048 was incomplete and presented their findings for CVE-2020-1337 at the **Black Hat** security conference earlier this month. More information on CVE-2020-1337, including a video demonstration of a proof-of-concept exploit, is available [here](https://voidsec.com/cve-2020-1337-printdemon-is-dead-long-live-printdemon/).

**Adobe** has graciously given us another month’s respite from patching **Flash Player** flaws, but it did release critical security updates for its **Acrobat** and **PDF Reader** products. More information on those updates is available [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb20-48.html).

Keep in mind that while staying up-to-date on Windows patches is a must, it’s important to make sure you’re updating only after you’ve backed up your important data and files. A reliable backup means you’re less likely to pull your hair out when the odd buggy patch causes problems booting the system.

So do yourself a favor and backup your files before installing any patches. Windows 10 even has [some built-in tools](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-back-up-your-computer-automatically-with-windows-1762867473) to help you do that, either on a per-file/folder basis or by making a complete and bootable copy of your hard drive all at once.

And as ever, if you experience glitches or problems installing any of these patches this month, please consider leaving a comment about it below; there’s a better-than-even chance other readers have experienced the same and may chime in here with some helpful tips.

   For those of us who have roughly a dozen machines to deal with, these patches are a huge pain in the ass..

         Yeah, I patch about 800 servers every month and it’s just a game of averages at this point. If I get above an 85% successful patch install rate and no major application outages afterward, then it’s a good month. I can remediate whatever remains–which is never less than a dozen!

      I’m pretty sure unwinding malware from your six boxes is going to be infinitely more painful than the patches. It literally took me about 5 minutes to patch one box, and it’s not like you have to do them serially.

   I tend to live mostly in the Apple OS world and use SuperDuper to clone my drive.

   If you have Windows 10 and especially if you have a dual bootable Windows 10/Linux system, what is the best way to clone the entire drive?

   I’m guessing you can use rsync when you boot into Linux and backup the entire drive? My goal would be to create a clone of the drive with both OS on it.

      I use Macrium Reflect for cloning and imaging hard drives. Used for many years, never had any issues.

      1. [Sharron Idol](https://buggerallon.tv) [August 11, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-515004)

         Macrium Reflect is a good product, but there are a couple of drawbacks. – ‘See thing is it’s free; and you get your money’s worth.

         For a faultless and money-backed clone I recommend Acronis True Image (Latest version).

         1. JCitizen [August 11, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-515009)

            I’ve used Macrium Reflect for over a decade now, with the free and paid version, and I’ve had not one failure to recover, and neither have my clients. I am not a shill for MR, how about you?

            1. SeymourB [August 12, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-515019)

               I’m not a paid shill but Acronis is relatively problem-free. The only issue is needing to buy new versions periodically as old versions don’t typically support new OS versions. But its had a bootable media builder for wholesale wipe & reload system restores for years. The couple times I’ve had to use it everything worked without any fuss. Now that being said I never heard of Macrium Reflex, so I’m certainly going to give it a look before plunking money down on a new version of Acronis. In the 15 or so years I’ve been using Acronis I’ve only bought 2 upgrades (to go from XP to 7, then 7 to 10) so it’s not horrible. And it goes on sale for around $10 every so often (full product, not an upgrad) so the cost isn’t always onerous.

               1. JCitizen [August 12, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-515125)

                  Good to know – thanks! Macrium will occasionally block an update if one is using the free version, but eventually the update is allowed as time goes on. Since I’ve been using the same PC for 12 years or so now, and still using Win 7 (updated with micro patches from Opatch) I haven’t run into the compatibility problem yet, but my sister did, when she bought a new PC; she was glad to pay for a new Macrium License for the Pro version, and the price is more than reasonable. In the past the only difference I could tell about the Pro and free versions, was that you got access to a Windows environment image instead of the free Linux one, and some IT pro files to help with that line of work. I’m sure that has changed as they seem to be stepping up their game to keep updating Macrium Reflect.

                  Note it is spelled REFLECT and not reflex – just to clarify here.

         Thirding Reflect, for things like imaging old laptops and restoring them when Windows breaks it’s awesome!

         1. Nijel [August 12, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-515036)

            Macrium Reflect is my go-to backup solution for imaging / cloning hard drives on Windows machines. It’s well maintained & has never failed me. It has advanced features like the ability to virtually boot a backup image & backing up to a network shared folder.
      5. Jon [August 12, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-515112)

         I have been using Macrium Reflect for years as well. I have both nightly incremental backups to my NAS as well I use it for one off cloning. It’s a fantastic product and I’ve never had one issue with it.

      Clonezilla has been my go to for,,, hmm I think well over 10 years. Used it to successfully clone a failing encrypted disk once. All command line, but works perfect. Also used it at a company for imaging across the network, no complaints 🙂

    Careful with your backups. My support ticket to Microsoft using the VSS (file history) recently ended with Microsoft saying that file history should NOT be used to backup user data files. It is only intended for system files (WTF).

    If you use file history versions and rely on it as your backup, then make sure you test the recovery of files on a regular basis.

    1. Anon [August 11, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-514996)

       I agree with MSFT on this one…Snapshots are not the same as backups.

       VSS is handy to temporarily protect file versions or to read a large file for backup operation while the original is still in use. Since VSS snapshots are on the same storage as the original file it should not be relied on as data protection strategy.

       Also, It sounds like you ran into a an file consistency issue. If the OS initiates a VSS Snapshot it can only collect what has been written to the disk. The application need to be VSS aware (which I do not believe Access or Excel are). VSS aware applications like SQL Server will flush data from memory to disk to create a consistent & recoverable file before VSS is allowed to continue.

       It would be like trying to recover a file after pulling the power from the computer while a MSAccess save operation was in process..
    3. Dave [August 12, 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/microsoft-patch-tuesday-august-2020-edition/#comment-515040)

       There are some nice versioning-based backup systems that avoid needing to fiddle with VSS. I use Syncback, which automatically snapshots data to a remote device or server and will store multiple generations of files, which is useful for dealing with ransomware.

          shadow copies are not really a backup solution… had so many issues with them. I do use them so users can restore their own files if needed in their fs dirs.

    Wait, File History is no longer meant for user files?! <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143> makes no mention of this and it sounds like the same user backup utility as ever before.

    I had 2 updates, one a NET update, the other the cumulative Windows update. NET did it’s thing but the other borked the system enough even windows said it was going to uninstall it after 3 BSs in a row (that did not write dmp file…) Anyway, thought Windows seeing the system needed to uninstall the updates was nice but the system was weird. Used Acronis to restore a 3 day old C: drive image. One weirdness with Acronis is that I used a backup stored on one of my NAS’s and after the Acronis restore, I could not see that NAS via Windows. The other NAS not involved with the backup was normal and windows saw it fine. Got it back though, thought it was weird.

       Windows 10 2004 has a Windows Update reboot loop. Don’t know the exact reasoning yet, but to fix:

       Shutdown Windows Update Service

       Delete c:\windows\softwaredistribution\downloads

       Restart Windows Update Service

       Go to Windows Updates and retry.

       Worked for my laptop.

          Delete the contents of the c:\windows\softwaredistribution\downloads folder, not the folder itself. Just to clarify.

    I was greeted with an Adobe Flash update this morning (08/12/2020). So, I was surprised to see this article say that Adobe did not publish any Flash updates.

       Not all Flash updates have security fixes. I forget which is which but it’s either only the odd-numbered versions or even numbered that have security updates included. I know that doesn’t help much, but there weren’t any security updates available this month for Flash (yet). It is always possible you were running an outdated version though.

    I agree with the positive comments on Macrium Reflect. Many years ago I used Acronis but there were problems. Have since been using Macrium Reflect free and paid versions for both Win7 and Win10 with no problems. It’s frequently updated and the updating process is easy (usually ‘patching’). One good feature is that you can make automatic verification after the backup image has been made. (Here is a small difference between paid and free editions – in the free edition you have to set this every time, in the paid the setting is remembered next time). I’ve also used it once for cloning to a larger SSD drive – with Windows 7. That gave only one problem – Microsoft began telling me that my Windows was not genuine! But these messages could just be ignored. I think this may not be a problem in Windows 10.

    Anyone else running into AD authentication issues after installing the CVE-2020-1472 Netlogon updates? We’ve installed it in 4 domains so far, one is Server 2008 R2 the others are 2012 R2. Only one of the 2012 domains was not affected. The others had Netlogon events indicating that authentication failed to the various domain controllers. This led to being unable to RDP to some servers, errors connecting to TFS and SQL Server, etc. After uninstalling the update from the domain controllers the issues were resolved.

    This patch/update is a huge nightmare. My husband owns a $1300, 2 month old Alienware beautiful gaming laptop. It’s essentially been a brick for the last 6 hours.

    He has had to factory reset and that was 2 hours ago and it’s still “updating”. I have the option to update myself(on my over 1 year old Dell machine) and I certainly won’t be doing it before Monday at the earliest, as I’m not trusting my low powered computer to not crap out as well.

    I’m over Microsoft putting out “updates’ that work so poorly they then need to come up with a patch for the patch.

    Such cases are the reason ‘they’ (i.e. not MS) recommend you put updates on pause for 2-3 weeks every month. (‘They’ = e.g. Brian Krebs, Woody Leonhard (‘AskWoody’) and Susan Bradley).

    By that time MS has usually patched the errors. They effectively use ordinary users as beta testers. But you can avoid that by postponing the updates.

       That truly is the only solution, if you tinker with the services to stop updates it will pepper you with failure notifications, and if you turn those off nothing works lol. Windows 10 is a trap in a box marked “trap” – every single month this year it’s been russian roulette hamster experiments on the users at large. From the inception really, from the moment it popped itself up as a startup routine in Windows 7 without being invited under the guise of an ‘upgrade’ nobody had to affirmatively ask for to have try to install itself, literally.

       -Sent from Windows 7, the last honest MS box marked trap.

    I wonder if it’s related to Home vs Pro vs Enterprise. I’ve one home machine that hiccuped about Windows 10 licensing, but a reboot fixed that. I never see update issues on Windows Server 2012 or Windows 10 Enterprise or Pro.

    One has to wonder, especially if one is an OG in Windows what in the hell is wrong with the process if you can rack up 100+ bugs meriting and update with ~10% of those being critical enough to make the CISA warnings!. That is ludicrously poor quality control. Don’t they use the Windows equivalents of lint, valgrind, gcov, etc?

    This latest update has really screwed my current laptop. I’m still running Windows 7, and I use Chrome. The whole system has become unstable — frequent shutdowns; inability to check Yahoo mail properly (I can’t delete e-mail without it opening up); I can’t even get into my College’s web portal right: Outlook e-mail bounces me out, and a number of apps don’t work.

    Yeah, I’m not a super-computer genius, but for a lot of folks who need their computer to do basic things and are just savvy enough, this is a massive nightmare and inconvenience. Not what I needed with the new academic year beginning, and I know a lot of my colleagues feel the same.

    I’ve been doing IT support for 41 years and the last 18 months have been the worst because of those windows updates designed by summer trainees at M$. 2020-08 after being installed on our Dell T110 II DC running 2012R2 somehow managed to screw up Netlogon so it was impossible to log on it with domain admin credentials. Had to roll back a month with veeam backup and redo the work that was done since then on it. So i bet civilization is not going to fall because of running out of conventional oil, but because of the accumulation of poor OS and firmware design like windows and uefi (which multiplies by 1000 the attack surface for hackers). The more time goes by, the more Theodore Kaczynski looks like a prophet albeit a violent one.
