An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) Service improperly discloses contents of its memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the userâ€™s system.
To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker could connect an imaging device (camera, scanner, cellular phone) to an affected system and run a specially crafted application to disclose information.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the WIA Service handles objects in memory.
