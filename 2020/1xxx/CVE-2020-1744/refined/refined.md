Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to send failed login events to the BruteForceProtector in Keycloak when using a Conditional OTP (One-Time Password) Authentication Flow as a post-login flow of an Identity Provider (IDP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Event Handling:**  Failed login attempts during Conditional OTP authentication are not being properly registered or sent to the brute force protection mechanism.
- **Bypass of Brute-Force Protection:** Because failed login events aren't being sent, the `BruteForceProtector` doesn't receive the information to block potentially malicious repeated login attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to accounts if they could repeatedly attempt logins without being blocked.
- **System Availability:** The lack of brute-force protection can also lead to system availability issues due to resources being consumed by malicious login attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the Keycloak login interface.
- **Conditional OTP Flow:** Specifically targeting the Conditional OTP authentication flow configured as a post login flow of an IDP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Keycloak login interface.
- **Valid Username:** The attacker needs to target a valid username in order to trigger the OTP post-login flow.
- **Repeated Login Attempts:** Requires the ability to repeatedly try login attempts, thus triggering the brute force protections.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed in Keycloak version 9.0.1.
- Patches were released via multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs): RHSA-2020:0945, RHSA-2020:0946, RHSA-2020:0947, RHSA-2020:0951, RHSA-2020:2252, RHSA-2020:2905.
- The vulnerability is tracked upstream as `KEYCLOAK-12986`.
