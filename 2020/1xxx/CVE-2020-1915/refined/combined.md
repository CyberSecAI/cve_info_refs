Handle set where internalSetter and Proxy are both true

Summary:
If putComputed is called on a proxy whose target's prototype
is an array with a propname of 'length', then internalSetter will be
true, and the receiver will be a proxy.  In that case, proxy needs to
win; the behavior may assert or be UB otherwise.

# CVE-2020-1915

**Description:**  An out-of-bounds read in the JavaScript Interpreter in Facebook Hermes prior to commit 8cb935cd3b2321c46aa6b7ed8454d95c75a7fca0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service attack or possible further memory corruption via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected. **Affected Versions:** commit prior to 8cb935cd3b2321c46aa6b7ed8454d95c75a7fca0 **Last Updated:** 10-26-2020
