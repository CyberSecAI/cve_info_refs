- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to the software reading data past the end of the intended buffer when parsing certain PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data beyond the allocated buffer when processing specific PIM messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could cause out-of-bounds reads. The specific impact beyond this isn't detailed in this document.
- **Attack vectors**: An adjacent attacker could send crafted PIM messages to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be in an adjacent network and be capable of sending PIM messages to the affected device.
