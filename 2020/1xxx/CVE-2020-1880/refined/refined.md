- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation when executing a specially crafted file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation on values within a crafted file, which is then executed by the device.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to abnormal device behavior, which is a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires tricking a user into executing the malicious file on the affected Huawei device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific file, and then trick the user into executing it. No specific network access is specified, but user interaction is a requirement.
