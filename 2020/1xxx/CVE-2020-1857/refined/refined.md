- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper processing of some data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leakage due to the improper handling of data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may lead to information leakage.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device is required. An authenticated attacker needs to perform a series of unspecified operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local authenticated attacker with access to the device.
