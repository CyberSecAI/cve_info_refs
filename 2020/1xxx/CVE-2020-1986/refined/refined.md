Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an "Improper input validation" issue within Secdo for Windows. Specifically, the application does not properly validate user-controlled input during folder creation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The software fails to sanitize or validate user input when handling folder creation requests. This allows a malicious user to create a specific folder, which later causes the system to crash when accessed by the operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a system crash on every login attempt. This results in a denial-of-service condition, preventing normal use of the affected system.
- **Availability Impact (HIGH):** The primary impact is a complete loss of system availability due to the continuous crashing behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack Vector (AV:L):** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the affected system.
- **Local Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a local user with specific permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Windows system.
- **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** The attacker must be a local authenticated user with 'create folders or append data' access to the root of the OS disk (C:\). This doesn't require administrative rights.
- **No User Interaction (UI:N):** No specific user interaction is needed to trigger the exploit. The system crashes automatically on login.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Product:** Secdo for Windows (all versions).
- **Unaffected Products:** None
- **Mitigation:** The issue can be mitigated by creating a "C:\proc" folder and restricting access to it, preventing unprivileged users from creating folders in the root of the OS disk, which would block them from creating the folder that causes the crash.
- **No Fix Available:** The product is no longer supported; therefore, no official patch is available.

**Summary**
CVE-2020-1986 details a vulnerability in Secdo for Windows where a local, low-privileged user can cause a system crash on login due to improper input validation during folder creation. The attack vector is local, and the vulnerability has a high impact on system availability.
