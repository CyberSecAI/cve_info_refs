### Description

Improper input validation vulnerability in Secdo allows an authenticated local user with 'create folders or append data' access to the root of the OS disk (C:\) to cause a system crash on every login. This issue affects all versions Secdo for Windows.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Secdo | all versions on Windows | None |

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
5.5 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-20 Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20")

### Solution

This product is no longer supported and the issue will not be fixed. This issue can be easily mitigated by creating a "C:\proc" folder and not allowing unprivileged users to access to that folder, or ensuring unprivileged users do not have 'create folder' access to the root of a disk (C:\).

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Exploitation of this issue can be prevented by creating a "C:\proc" folder and not allowing unprivileged users to access that folder.

### Acknowledgments

We like to thank Eviatar Gerzi of CyberArk Labs Team for discovering and reporting this issue.
