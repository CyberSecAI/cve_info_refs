- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of specifically crafted TCP packets by the PAN-OS signature-based threat detection engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the way PAN-OS processes TCP packets, allowing crafted packets to bypass threat prevention signatures.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to evade threat prevention signatures. While confidentiality and availability are not impacted, the accuracy of threat prevention is reduced, potentially allowing malicious traffic to pass undetected. It does not grant access to resources blocked by firewall policies, or impact other security features, nor does it affect service availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is over the network using crafted TCP packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be in a remote network position and does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability, but needs to craft the TCP packets to evade the signature engine.
