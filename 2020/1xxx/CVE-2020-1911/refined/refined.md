Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-1911:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within Facebook Hermes when resolving properties of JavaScript objects. This occurs when these objects have specially crafted prototype chains. Specifically, the issue arises when looking up HostObject computed properties on the right-hand side of an operation within the prototype chain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is a type confusion vulnerability. This means that the code is incorrectly interpreting the type of data being accessed, leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Improper Handling of Prototype Chains:** The vulnerability occurs when resolving properties on objects with specially crafted prototype chains. This indicates a flaw in how Hermes handles property lookups in these complex scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting this vulnerability. This implies a severe impact as it allows the attacker to gain control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted JavaScript:** The attack vector involves using specially crafted JavaScript code to trigger the type confusion.
- **Evaluation of Untrusted JavaScript:**  The vulnerability is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits the evaluation of untrusted JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within an environment using the vulnerable version of Hermes.

**Additional Notes:**
- **React Native:** The provided information clarifies that most React Native applications are not affected because they typically do not allow the evaluation of untrusted JavaScript that is not shipped with the app itself.
- **Patch:** The vulnerability was fixed in commit fe52854cdf6725c2eaa9e125995da76e6ceb27da of the Hermes project.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, with high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type).
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of Hermes prior to the fix (<= 0.4.3) are affected. Patched versions are 0.5.2 and later.
