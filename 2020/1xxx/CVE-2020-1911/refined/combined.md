# CVE-2020-1911

**Description:**  A type confusion vulnerability when resolving properties of JavaScript objects with specially-crafted prototype chains in Facebook Hermes prior to commit fe52854cdf6725c2eaa9e125995da76e6ceb27da allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected. **Affected Versions:** commit prior to fe52854cdf6725c2eaa9e125995da76e6ceb27da **Last Updated:** 09-03-2020

## Description

A type confusion vulnerability when resolving properties of JavaScript objects with specially-crafted prototype chains in Facebook Hermes prior to commit fe52854cdf6725c2eaa9e125995da76e6ceb27da allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Summary:
The change in the hermes repository fixes the security vulnerability
[CVE-2020-1911](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5x2-xv93-4p23 "CVE-2020-1911").  This vulnerability only affects applications which
allow evaluation of uncontrolled, untrusted JavaScript code not
shipped with the app, so React Native apps will generally not be affected.

This revision includes a test for the bug.  The test is generic JSI
code, so it is included in the hermes and react-native repositories.
