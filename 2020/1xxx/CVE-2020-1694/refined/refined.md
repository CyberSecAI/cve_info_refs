Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1694

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the missing support for the "verify-token-audience" configuration parameter in the Keycloak NodeJS adapter. This parameter is used to verify that the token audience matches the intended recipient, and its absence allows for potential access to sensitive information by unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of audience verification for tokens in the NodeJS adapter. This means that tokens intended for other services or clients could potentially be accepted by the vulnerable adapter, which leads to improper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is that some users may gain unauthorized access to sensitive information that they should not have access to. This can be a significant security risk, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a token issued for a different audience with the vulnerable Keycloak NodeJS adapter. Since the adapter does not verify the audience, it might accept the token, allowing the attacker to bypass intended authorization mechanisms and access protected resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to have obtained a valid token issued by Keycloak for a different client or service other than the one intended to be protected by the vulnerable Keycloak NodeJS adapter. The attacker would then attempt to use this token with the vulnerable adapter.

**Summary**

In summary, the vulnerability lies in the missing implementation of audience verification in the Keycloak NodeJS adapter which leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information. The attacker needs a valid token issued for a different audience.
