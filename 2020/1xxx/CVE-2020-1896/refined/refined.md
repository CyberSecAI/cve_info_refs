Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `hermesBuiltinApply` function of the Facebook Hermes JavaScript engine. This function lacked a check for stack overflows, allowing for uncontrolled recursion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability in `hermesBuiltinApply` function.
- Missing stack overflow check when applying a function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted JavaScript payload.
- This is due to the stack overflow allowing control of the execution flow.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation is achieved by passing a crafted JavaScript payload to a vulnerable application. This payload leverages the `apply` functionality with a function that recurses excessively.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to pass and execute untrusted JavaScript within an application using a vulnerable version of Hermes.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments of the `apply` function, or trigger the excessive recursion.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable in most React Native applications due to their sandboxed nature unless specifically configured to allow execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in commit `86543ac47e59c522976b5632b8bf9a2a4583c7d2`.
- The fix adds a stack overflow check using `newFrame.overflowed()` before allocating space for arguments, preventing the overflow.
- A test case (`test/hermes/stack-overflow-apply.js`) was created to verify the fix.
