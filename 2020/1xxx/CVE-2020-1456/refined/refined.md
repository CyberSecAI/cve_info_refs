Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-1456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied input when setting a user's profile picture in Microsoft SharePoint 2019.
*   Specifically, the `ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ProfileEditorEditPictureURL` parameter, which is part of the POST request when saving changes to a user's profile, is vulnerable. This parameter, intended to hold the path to the uploaded profile picture, can be modified by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Input:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the URL provided in the `ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ProfileEditorEditPictureURL` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Misclassified:** While Microsoft categorized this as XSS, the vulnerability doesn't involve typical JavaScript execution. Instead, it involves the insertion of arbitrary URLs into the profile picture attribute which can have a variety of impacts, but not direct JavaScript code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** By inserting a link to a large file, the attacker can force clients to download large amounts of data, potentially causing network congestion or exhaustion of bandwidth. Also, crafted requests to resources on cloud infrastructure can lead to a ban of the companies IP address.
*   **User Tracking:** The embedded link can be used to track users. The referrer header sent by the browser can leak user information, and this data can be stored by the attacker, potentially leading to GDPR violations.
*   **Internal Path Disclosure:** The default configuration of IIS can send internal paths in the request, further enabling tracking and potentially leaking information.
*   **Obfuscated Attacks:** Malicious links can be embedded to relay attacks such as DoS, stored XSS, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This means any user viewing the profile with the modified URL will automatically become part of the attack.
*   **Reputation Damage:** Embedding links to inappropriate sites can lead to user behavior being flagged by the company proxy, causing potential disciplinary actions against users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through an authenticated user modifying the `ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ProfileEditorEditPictureURL` parameter in the POST request when updating their profile picture.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the SharePoint system to access and modify their profile settings.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify Requests:** The attacker needs to intercept the POST request to modify the `ctl00$PlaceHolderMain$ProfileEditorEditPictureURL` parameter. This can be achieved through techniques like using a proxy or other web request interception tools.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in SharePoint Server 2019 on-premises.
*   The issue is not directly related to Office 365 integration, as profile pictures in SharePoint on-premises were not synced to Office 365 during the tests.
*   The vulnerability was categorized as XSS by Microsoft.
*   The CVSS v2 score is 6.5 (Medium) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P
*   The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.5 (Medium) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
