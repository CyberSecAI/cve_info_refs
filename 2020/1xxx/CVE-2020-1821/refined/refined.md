Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-1821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the implementation of the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol in certain Huawei products.
*   Specifically, a decoding function is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read when processing an incoming data packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core weakness is that the vulnerable function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a read out-of-bounds condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in service disruption on the affected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited via network access.
*   An attacker needs to send a specially crafted COPS data packet to the vulnerable function in the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to access the network where the vulnerable Huawei devices are located.

**Additional Information:**
*   This document indicates that CVE-2020-1821 is one of seven CVEs resulting from a set of related vulnerabilities (HWPSIRT-2018-12275, HWPSIRT-2018-12276, HWPSIRT-2018-12277, HWPSIRT-2018-12278, HWPSIRT-2018-12279, HWPSIRT-2018-12280 and HWPSIRT-2018-12289) within the COPS implementation.
*   The advisory provides a list of affected Huawei products and software versions, along with the fixed versions, and links to obtain the fixes.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 3.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L), and a temporal score of 3.5 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C).
