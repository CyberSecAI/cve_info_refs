## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

* [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

* [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)
## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

# [R1] Nessus Network Monitor 5.11.1 Fixes One Third-party Vulnerability

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus Network Monitor leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL components to address the potential impact of these issues. Nessus Network Monitor 5.11.1 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1g to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus Network Monitor 5.11.1 to address this issue. The patch can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-network-monitor).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-20:11.openssl Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: OpenSSL remote denial of service vulnerability
Category: contrib
Module: openssl
Announced: 2020-04-21
Credits: Bernd Edlinger
Affects: FreeBSD 12.1
Corrected: 2020-04-21 15:47:58 UTC (stable/12, 12.1-STABLE)
2020-04-21 15:53:08 UTC (releng/12.1, 12.1-RELEASE-p4)
CVE Name: CVE-2020-1967
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is a
collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) protocols. It is also a full-strength general purpose
cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
Server or client applications that call the SSL\_check\_chain() function during
or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a
result of incorrect handling of the "signature\_algorithms\_cert" TLS
extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognized signature
algorithm is received from the peer.
III. Impact
A malicious peer could exploit the NULL pointer dereference crash, causing a
denial of service attack.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:11/openssl.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:11/openssl.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/12/ r360147
releng/12.1/ r360150
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Fix NULL dereference in SSL\_check\_chain() for TLS 1.3

```
In the tls1_check_sig_alg() helper function, we loop through the list of
"signature_algorithms_cert" values received from the client and attempt
to look up each one in turn in our internal table that maps wire
codepoint to string-form name, digest and/or signature NID, etc., in
order to compare the signature scheme from the peer's list against what
is used to sign the certificates in the certificate chain we're
checking.  Unfortunately, when the peer sends a value that we don't
support, the lookup returns NULL, but we unconditionally dereference the
lookup result for the comparison, leading to an application crash
triggerable by an unauthenticated client.

Since we will not be able to say anything about algorithms we don't
recognize, treat NULL return from lookup as "does not match".

We currently only apply the "signature_algorithm_cert" checks on TLS 1.3
connections, so previous TLS versions are unaffected.  SSL_check_chain()
is not called directly from libssl, but may be used by the application
inside a callback (e.g., client_hello or cert callback) to verify that a
candidate certificate chain will be acceptable to the client.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

#### Description

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature\_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature\_algorithms\_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).

NetApp has a long-held and ongoing commitment to compliance with the ever-evolving set of global, regional, and data security and privacy standards and regulations. We uphold this commitment through self-assessments and rigorous audits by independent accredited third parties. These audits validate the adherence of our products and services to the requirements of such standards as ISO/IEC 27001, the GDPR, and the Common Criteria. These assessments help demonstrate NetApp’s integration of internationally recognized processes and best practices in our business, enabling customers to use our products and services regardless of their compliance needs.

NetApp supplies information for each compliance offering (listed at left) that includes a list of in-scope software and hardware and links to the relevant certificates and auditor’s reports.

> ### Starting on a foundation of globally recognized standards means that digital transformation can follow a known roadmap of security and privacy compliance.

## Common Criteria

Continuing a certification tradition dating back to 2005, when NetApp Data ONTAP was first certified, NetApp has achieved Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009) certification for its storage software and hardware products. Independent accredited testing laboratories audited NetApp products and certified their compliance with Common Criteria. NetApp government and government contractor customers can rely on our Common Criteria certification for their purchasing requirements.

# CVE-2020-1967

Proof of concept exploit about OpenSSL signature\_algorithms\_cert DoS flaw (CVE-2020-1967). Credit for the original finding to Bernd Edlinger, additional analysis by Matt Caswell and Benjamin Kaduk, this demo by Imre Rad.

## Prerequisite

Server or client applications that call the `SSL_check_chain()` function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake. According to the documentation, `SSL_check_chain()` checks whether certificate x, private key pk and certificate chain chain is suitable for use with the current session s. This function call is NOT present in the popular Apache httpd or Nginx projects.

## Demo

To exploit this vulnerability, a crafted signature\_algorithms\_cert TLS extension needs to be submitted as part of the Hello message. I used a patched version of the openssl library to build such a client; the server is the built-in s\_server openssl app, along with the -x options to activate the code path that invokes `SSL_check_chain`.

Setting up the server on a Debian stable (using the vulnerable version explicitly):

```
root@489def7f3594:/data# apt install libssl1.1=1.1.1d-0+deb10u2 openssl=1.1.1d-0+deb10u2
...

root@489def7f3594:/data# openssl version
OpenSSL 1.1.1d  10 Sep 2019

root@489def7f3594:/data# openssl s_server -cert cert.pem -key key.pem  -accept 8443 -verify 1 -tls1_3 -xkey key.pem -xcert cert.pem  -xchain cert.pem
verify depth is 1
Using default temp DH parameters
ACCEPT

```

Sending the payload using the patched client:

```
root@489def7f3594:/data# /path/to/patched/openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:8443 -tls1_3 -cert cert.pem -key key.pem -sigalgs rsa_pss_rsae_sha256
CONNECTED(00000004)
Sending CVE-2020-1967 payload
...

```

And the server is supposed to segfault at this point. The core looks like this:

```

Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-1967

Bernd Edlinger discovered that malformed data passed to the
SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake could
cause a NULL dereference, resulting in denial of service.

The oldstable distribution (stretch) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1d-0+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

For the detailed security status of openssl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl>

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2749094.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2749094.1).

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# [R1] Tenable.sc 5.17.0 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable.sc leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Two separate third-party components (jQuery and OpenSSL) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled libraries to address the potential impact of these issues. Tenable.sc version 5.17.0 will update jQuery to 3.5.1 and OpenSSL to 1.1.1i to address the identified vulnerabilities.

Additionally, Tenable.sc 5.17.0 will also address an Access Control issue within the Automatic Distribution configuration. In certain scenarios, a scanner could potentially be used outside the user's defined scan zone for a scan without a particular zone being specified.

### Solution

Tenable has released Tenable.sc 5.17.0 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/tenable-sc).

*This page contains information regarding security vulnerabilities that may impact Tenable's products. This may include issues specific to our software, or due to the use of third-party libraries within our software. Tenable strongly encourages users to ensure that they upgrade or apply relevant patches in a timely manner.*

*Tenable takes product security very seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in one of our products, we ask that you please work with us to quickly resolve it in order to protect customers.
Tenable believes in responding quickly to such reports, maintaining communication with researchers, and providing a solution in short order.*

*For more details on submitting vulnerability information, please see our [Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines](/security/report) page.*

*If you have questions or corrections about this advisory, please email
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b6b3a1bea4b8a5beb2a497a3b2b9b6b5bbb2f9b4b8ba)*

#### Description

There is an overflow bug in the x64\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN\_mod\_exp may be affected if they use BN\_FLG\_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-1967 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1967)

#### Description

Server or client applications that call the SSL\_check\_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the "signature\_algorithms\_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).

# [R1] LCE 6.0.9 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable Log Correlation Engine leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Two separate third-party components (OpenSSL, jQuery) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL and jQuery components to address the potential impact of these issues. LCE 6.0.9 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1k and jQuery to version 3.5.1 to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Log Correlation Engine 6.0.9 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/log-correlation-engine).

*This page contains information regarding security vulnerabilities that may impact Tenable's products. This may include issues specific to our software, or due to the use of third-party libraries within our software. Tenable strongly encourages users to ensure that they upgrade or apply relevant patches in a timely manner.*

*Tenable takes product security very seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in one of our products, we ask that you please work with us to quickly resolve it in order to protect customers.
Tenable believes in responding quickly to such reports, maintaining communication with researchers, and providing a solution in short order.*

*For more details on submitting vulnerability information, please see our [Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines](/security/report) page.*

*If you have questions or corrections about this advisory, please email
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aecfcad8c7ddc1dcc7cbddeedacbc0cfccc2cb80cdc1c3)*

# [R1] Nessus Agent 7.6.3 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus Agent leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) was found to contain a multiple vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled library to address the potential impact of these issues in Nessus Agent. Nessus Agent 7.6.3 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1g to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus Agent 7.6.3 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-agents)

#### Description

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl\_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

# CVE-2020-1967: proving sigalg != NULL

*From*: Imre Rad <radimre83 () gmail com>

```
I created a proof of concept exploit about the recent OpenSSL
signature_algorithms_cert DoS flaw (CVE-2020-1967). Credit for the
original finding goes to Bernd Edlinger.

This is a null pointer dereference while processing a crafted
signature_algorithms_cert TLS extension via the SSL_check_chain() API
method. Applications do need to call this method explicitly, it is not
invoked by default during the handshake. The segmentation fault of a
TLS service could look like this:

Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x00007f09bcff3770 in tls1_check_sig_alg.part.0.cold () from
/data/openssl-1.1.1d/libssl.so
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007f09bcff3770 in tls1_check_sig_alg.part.0.cold () from
/data/openssl-1.1.1d/libssl.so
#1  0x00007f09bd03f309 in tls1_check_chain () from

#6  0x00007f09bd00fbb9 in ssl_write_internal () from
/data/openssl-1.1.1d/libssl.so
#7  0x00007f09bd00fd07 in SSL_write () from /data/openssl-1.1.1d/libssl.so
#8  0x00007f09bd3e337d in sv_body ()
#9  0x00007f09bd40757a in do_server ()

#11 0x00007f09bd3cea46 in do_cmd ()
#12 0x00007f09bd3b89fd in main ()

This exploit relies on a patched version of openssl's s_client and can

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for rust, rust-cbindgen
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2020:0933-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1115645 #1154817 #1173202
Cross-References: CVE-2020-1967
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 15.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for rust, rust-cbindgen fixes the following issues:
rust was updated for use by Firefox 76ESR.
- Fixed miscompilations with rustc 1.43 that lead to LTO failures
(bsc#1173202)
Update to version 1.43.1
- Updated openssl-src to 1.1.1g for CVE-2020-1967.
- Fixed the stabilization of AVX-512 features.
- Fixed `cargo package --list` not working with unpublished dependencies.
Update to version 1.43.0
+ Language:
- Fixed using binary operations with `&{number}` (e.g. `&1.0`) not having
the type inferred correctly.
- Attributes such as `#[cfg()]` can now be used on `if` expressions.
- Syntax only changes:
\* Allow `type Foo: Ord` syntactically.
\* Fuse associated and extern items up to defaultness.
\* Syntactically allow `self` in all `fn` contexts.
\* Merge `fn` syntax + cleanup item parsing.
\* `item` macro fragments can be interpolated into `trait`s, `impl`s, and
`extern` blocks. For example, you may now write: ```rust macro\_rules!
mac\_trait { ($i:item) => { trait T { $i } } } mac\_trait! { fn foo() {}
} ```
\* These are still rejected \*semantically\*, so you will likely receive an
error but these changes can be seen and parsed by macros and
conditional compilation.
+ Compiler
- You can now pass multiple lint flags to rustc to override the previous
flags.
For example; `rustc -D unused -A unused-variables` denies everything in
the `unused` lint group except `unused-variables` which is explicitly
allowed. However, passing `rustc -A unused-variables -D unused` denies
everything in the `unused` lint group \*\*including\*\* `unused-variables`
since the allow flag is specified before the deny flag (and therefore
overridden).
- rustc will now prefer your system MinGW libraries over its bundled
libraries if they are available on `windows-gnu`.
- rustc now buffers errors/warnings printed in JSON.
Libraries:
- `Arc<[T; N]>`, `Box<[T; N]>`, and `Rc<[T; N]>`, now implement
`TryFrom<Arc<[T]>>`,`TryFrom<Box<[T]>>`, and `TryFrom<Rc<[T]>>`
respectively.
\*\*Note\*\* These conversions are only available when `N` is `0..=32`.
- You can now use associated constants on floats and integers directly,
rather than having to import the module. e.g. You can now write
`u32::MAX` or `f32::NAN` with no imports.
- `u8::is\_ascii` is now `const`.
- `String` now implements `AsMut<str>`.
- Added the `primitive` module to `std` and `core`. This module reexports
Rust's primitive types. This is mainly useful in macros where you want
avoid these types being shadowed.
- Relaxed some of the trait bounds on `HashMap` and `HashSet`.
- `string::FromUtf8Error` now implements `Clone + Eq`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- `Once::is\_completed`
- `f32::LOG10\_2`
- `f32::LOG2\_10`
- `f64::LOG10\_2`
- `f64::LOG2\_10`
- `iter::once\_with`
+ Cargo
- You can now set config `[profile]`s in your `.cargo/config`,
or through your environment.
- Cargo will now set `CARGO\_BIN\_EXE\_<name>` pointing to a binary's
executable path when running integration tests or benchmarks. `<name>`
is the name of your binary as-is e.g. If you wanted the executable
path for a binary named `my-program`you would use
`env!("CARGO\_BIN\_EXE\_my-program")`.
+ Misc
- Certain checks in the `const\_err` lint were deemed unrelated to const
evaluation, and have been moved to the `unconditional\_panic` and
`arithmetic\_overflow` lints.
+ Compatibility Notes
- Having trailing syntax in the `assert!` macro is now a hard error.
This has been a warning since 1.36.0.
- Fixed `Self` not having the correctly inferred type. This incorrectly
led to some instances being accepted, and now correctly emits a hard
error.
Update to version 1.42.0:
+ Language
- You can now use the slice pattern syntax with subslices.
- You can now use #[repr(transparent)] on univariant enums. Meaning that
you can create an enum that has the exact layout and ABI of the type
it contains.
- There are some syntax-only changes:
\* default is syntactically allowed before items in trait definitions.
\* Items in impls (i.e. consts, types, and fns) may syntactically leave
out their bodies in favor of ;.
\* Bounds on associated types in impls are now syntactically allowed
(e.g. type Foo: Ord;).
\* ... (the C-variadic type) may occur syntactically directly as the
type of any function parameter. These are still rejected
semantically, so you will likely receive an error but these changes
can be seen and parsed by procedural macros and conditional
compilation.
+ Compiler
- Added tier 2 support for armv7a-none-eabi.
- Added tier 2 support for riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu.
- Option::{expect,unwrap} and Result::{expect, expect\_err, unwrap,
unwrap\_err} now produce panic messages pointing to the location where
they were called, rather than core's internals. Refer to Rust's
platform support page for more information on Rust's tiered platform
support.
+ Libraries
- iter::Empty<T> now implements Send and Sync for any T.
- Pin::{map\_unchecked, map\_unchecked\_mut} no longer require the return
type to implement Sized.
- io::Cursor now derives PartialEq and Eq.
- Layout::new is now const.
- Added Standard Library support for riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu.
+ Stabilized APIs
- CondVar::wait\_while
- CondVar::wait\_timeout\_while
- DebugMap::key
- DebugMap::value
- ManuallyDrop::take
- matches!
- ptr::slice\_from\_raw\_parts\_mut
- ptr::slice\_from\_raw\_parts
+ Cargo
- You no longer need to include extern crate proc\_macro; to be able to
use proc\_macro; in the 2018 edition.
+ Compatibility Notes
- Error::description has been deprecated, and its use will now produce a
warning. It's recommended to use Display/to\_string instead.
Update to version 1.41.1:
- Always check types of static items
- Always check lifetime bounds of `Copy` impls
- Fix miscompilation in callers of `Layout::repeat`
Update to version 1.41.0:
+ Language
- You can now pass type parameters to foreign items when implementing
traits. E.g. You can now write `impl<T> From<Foo> for Vec<T> {}`.
- You can now arbitrarily nest receiver types in the `self` position.
E.g. you can now write `fn foo(self: Box<Box<Self>>) {}`. Previously
only `Self`, `&Self`, `&mut Self`, `Arc<Self>`, `Rc<Self>`, and
`Box<Self>` were allowed.
- You can now use any valid identifier in a `format\_args` macro.
Previously identifiers starting with an underscore were not allowed.
- Visibility modifiers (e.g. `pub`) are now syntactically allowed on
trait items and enum variants. These are still rejected semantically,
but can be seen and parsed by procedural macros and conditional
compilation.
+ Compiler
- Rustc will now warn if you have unused loop `'label`s.
- Removed support for the `i686-unknown-dragonfly` target.
- Added tier 3 support\\* for the `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` target.
- You can now pass an arguments file passing the `@path` syntax to
rustc. Note that the format differs somewhat from what is found in
other tooling; please see the documentation for more information.
- You can now provide `--extern` flag without a path, indicating that it
is available from the search path or specified with an `-L` flag.
Refer to Rust's [platform support page][forge-platform-support] for more
information on Rust's tiered platform support.
+ Libraries
- The `core::panic` module is now stable. It was already stable through
`std`.
- `NonZero\*` numerics now implement `From<NonZero\*>` if it's a smaller
integer width. E.g. `NonZeroU16` now implements `From<NonZeroU8>`.
- `MaybeUninit<T>` now implements `fmt::Debug`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- `Result::map\_or`
- `Result::map\_or\_else`
- `std::rc::Weak::weak\_count`
- `std::rc::Weak::strong\_count`
- `std::sync::Weak::weak\_count`
- `std::sync::Weak::strong\_count`
+ Cargo
- Cargo will now document all the private items for binary crates by
default.
- `cargo-install` will now reinstall the package if it detects that it
is out
of date.
- Cargo.lock now uses a more git friendly format that should help to
reduce merge conflicts.
- You can now override specific dependencies's build settings. E.g.
`[profile.dev.package.image] opt-level = 2` sets the `image` crate's
optimisation level to `2` for debug builds. You can also use
`[profile.<profile>.build-override]` to override build scripts and
their dependencies.
+ Misc
- You can now specify `edition` in documentation code blocks to compile
the block for that edition. E.g. `edition2018` tells rustdoc that the
code sample should be compiled the 2018 edition of Rust.
- You can now provide custom themes to rustdoc with `--theme`, and check
the current theme with `--check-theme`.
- You can use `#[cfg(doc)]` to compile an item when building
documentation.
+ Compatibility Notes
- As previously announced 1.41.0 will be the last tier 1 release for
32-bit Apple targets. This means that the source code is still
available to build, but the targets are no longer being tested and
release binaries for those platforms will no longer be distributed by
the Rust project. Please refer to the linked blog post for more
information.
- Bump version of libssh2 for SLE15; we now need a version with
libssh2\_userauth\_publickey\_frommemory(), which appeared in libssh2 1.6.0.
Update to version 1.40.0
+ Language
- You can now use tuple `struct`s and tuple `enum` variant's
constructors in `const` contexts. e.g. pub struct Point(i32, i32);
const ORIGIN: Point = { let constructor = Point; constructor(0, 0) };
- You can now mark `struct`s, `enum`s, and `enum` variants with the
`#[non\_exhaustive]` attribute to indicate that there may be variants
or fields added in the future. For example this requires adding a
wild-card branch (`\_ => {}`) to any match statements on a
non-exhaustive `enum`.
- You can now use function-like procedural macros in `extern` blocks and
in type positions. e.g. `type Generated = macro!();`
- Function-like and attribute procedural macros can now emit
`macro\_rules!` items, so you can now have your macros generate macros.
- The `meta` pattern matcher in `macro\_rules!` now correctly matches the
modern attribute syntax. For example `(#[$m:meta])` now matches
`#[attr]`, `#[attr{tokens}]`, `#[attr[tokens]]`, and `#[attr(tokens)]`.
+ Compiler
- Added tier 3 support\\* for the `thumbv7neon-unknown-linux-musleabihf`
target.
- Added tier 3 support for the `aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat` target.
- Added tier 3 support for the `mips64-unknown-linux-muslabi64`, and
`mips64el-unknown-linux-muslabi64` targets.
+ Libraries
- The `is\_power\_of\_two` method on unsigned numeric types is now a
`const` function.
+ Stabilized APIs
- BTreeMap::get\_key\_value
- HashMap::get\_key\_value
- Option::as\_deref\_mut
- Option::as\_deref
- Option::flatten
- UdpSocket::peer\_addr
- f32::to\_be\_bytes
- f32::to\_le\_bytes
- f32::to\_ne\_bytes
- f64::to\_be\_bytes
- f64::to\_le\_bytes
- f64::to\_ne\_bytes
- f32::from\_be\_bytes
- f32::from\_le\_bytes
- f32::from\_ne\_bytes
- f64::from\_be\_bytes
- f64::from\_le\_bytes
- f64::from\_ne\_bytes
- mem::take
- slice::repeat
- todo!
+ Cargo
- Cargo will now always display warnings, rather than only on fresh
builds.
- Feature flags (except `--all-features`) passed to a virtual workspace
will now produce an error. Previously these flags were ignored.
- You can now publish `dev-dependencies` without including a `version`.
+ Misc
- You can now specify the `#[cfg(doctest)]` attribute to include an item
only when running documentation tests with `rustdoc`.
+ Compatibility Notes
- As previously announced, any previous NLL warnings in the 2015 edition
are now hard errors.
- The `include!` macro will now warn if it failed to include the entire
file. The `include!` macro unintentionally only includes the first
\_expression\_ in a file, and this can be unintuitive. This will become
either a hard error in a future release, or the behavior may be fixed
to include all expressions as expected.
- Using `#[inline]` on function prototypes and consts now emits a
warning under `unused\_attribute` lint. Using `#[inline]` anywhere else
inside traits
or `extern` blocks now correctly emits a hard error.
Update to version 1.39.0
+ Language
- You can now create async functions and blocks with async fn, async
move {}, and async {} respectively, and you can now call .await on
async expressions.
- You can now use certain attributes on function, closure, and function
pointer parameters.
- You can now take shared references to bind-by-move patterns in the if
guards of match arms.
+ Compiler
- Added tier 3 support for the i686-unknown-uefi target.
- Added tier 3 support for the sparc64-unknown-openbsd target.
- rustc will now trim code snippets in diagnostics to fit in your
terminal.
- You can now pass --show-output argument to test binaries to print the
output of successful tests.
+ For more details:
<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/stable/RELEASES.md#version-1390-2019>
-11-07
- Switch to bundled version of libgit2 for now. libgit2-sys seems to
expect using the bundled variant, which just seems to point to a
snapshot of the master branch and doesn't match any released libgit2
(bsc#1154817). See: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63476> and
<https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/issues/458> for details.
Update to version 1.38.0
+ Language
- The `#[global\_allocator]` attribute can now be used in submodules.
- The `#[deprecated]` attribute can now be used on macros.
+ Compiler
- Added pipelined compilation support to `rustc`. This will improve
compilation times in some cases.
+ Libraries
- `ascii::EscapeDefault` now implements `Clone` and `Display`.
- Derive macros for prelude traits (e.g. `Clone`, `Debug`, `Hash`) are
now available at the same path as the trait. (e.g. The `Clone` derive
macro is available at `std::clone::Clone`). This also makes all
built-in macros available in `std`/`core` root. e.g.
`std::include\_bytes!`.
- `str::Chars` now implements `Debug`.
- `slice::{concat, connect, join}` now accepts `&[T]` in addition to
`&T`.
- `\*const T` and `\*mut T` now implement `marker::Unpin`.
- `Arc<[T]>` and `Rc<[T]>` now implement `FromIterator<T>`.
- Added euclidean remainder and division operations (`div\_euclid`,
`rem\_euclid`) to all numeric primitives. Additionally `checked`,
`overflowing`, and `wrapping` versions are available for all integer
primitives.
- `thread::AccessError` now implements `Clone`, `Copy`, `Eq`, `Error`,
and `PartialEq`.
- `iter::{StepBy, Peekable, Take}` now implement `DoubleEndedIterator`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- `<\*const T>::cast`
- `<\*mut T>::cast`
- `Duration::as\_secs\_f32`
- `Duration::as\_secs\_f64`
- `Duration::div\_f32`
- `Duration::div\_f64`
- `Duration::from\_secs\_f32`
- `Duration::from\_secs\_f64`
- `Duration::mul\_f32`
- `Duration::mul\_f64`
- `any::type\_name`
+ Cargo
- Added pipelined compilation support to `cargo`.
- You can now pass the `--features` option multiple times to enable
multiple features.
+ Misc
- `rustc` will now warn about some incorrect uses of
`mem::{uninitialized, zeroed}` that are known to cause undefined
behaviour.
Update to version 1.37.0
+ Language
- #[must\_use] will now warn if the type is contained in a tuple, Box,
or an array and unused.
- You can now use the `cfg` and `cfg\_attr` attributes on generic
parameters.
- You can now use enum variants through type alias. e.g. You can write
the following: ``` type MyOption = Option<u8>; fn
increment\_or\_zero(x: MyOption) -> u8 { match x { MyOption::Some(y)
=> y + 1, MyOption::None => 0, } } ```
- You can now use `\_` as an identifier for consts. e.g. You can write
`const \_: u32 = 5;`.
- You can now use `#[repr(align(X)]` on enums.
- The `?` Kleene macro operator is now available in the 2015 edition.
+ Compiler
- You can now enable Profile-Guided Optimization with the `-C
profile-generate` and `-C profile-use` flags. For more information
on how to use profile guided optimization, please refer to the rustc
book.
- The `rust-lldb` wrapper script should now work again.
+ Libraries
- `mem::MaybeUninit<T>` is now ABI-compatible with `T`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- BufReader::buffer
- BufWriter::buffer
- Cell::from\_mut
- Cell<[T]>::as\_slice\_of\_cells

- u128::reverse\_bits
- u16::reverse\_bits
- u32::reverse\_bits
- u64::reverse\_bits
- u8::reverse\_bits
- usize::reverse\_bits
+ Cargo
- Cargo.lock files are now included by default when publishing
executable crates with executables.
- You can now specify `default-run="foo"` in `[package]` to specify
the default executable to use for `cargo run`.
- cargo-vendor is now provided as a sub-command of cargo
+ Compatibility Notes
- Using `...` for inclusive range patterns will now warn by default.
Please transition your code to using the `..=` syntax for inclusive
ranges instead.
- Using a trait object without the `dyn` will now warn by default.
Please transition your code to use `dyn Trait` for trait objects
instead. Crab(String), Lobster(String), Person(String), let state =
Creature::Crab("Ferris"); if let Creature::Crab(name) |
Creature::Person(name) = state { println!("This creature's name is:
{}", name); } unsafe { foo() } pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Self {
Self(x, y) } pub fn is\_origin(&self) -> bool { match self { Self(0,
0) => true, \_ => false, } } Self: PartialOrd<Self> // can write
`Self` instead of `List<T>` Nil, Cons(T, Box<Self>) // likewise here
fn test(&self) { println!("one"); } //~ ERROR duplicate definitions
with name `test` fn test(&self) { println!("two"); }
\* Basic procedural macros allowing custom `#[derive]`, aka "macros 1.1",
are stable. This allows popular code-generating crates like Serde and
Diesel to work ergonomically. [RFC 1681].
\* [Tuple structs may be empty. Unary and empty tuple structs may be
instantiated with curly braces][36868]. Part of [RFC 1506].
\* [A number of minor changes to name resolution have been
activated][37127]. They add up to more consistent semantics, allowing
for future evolution of Rust macros. Specified in [RFC 1560], see its
section on ["changes"] for details of what is different. The breaking
changes here have been transitioned through the [`legacy\_imports`] lint
since 1.14, with no known regressions.
\* [In `macro\_rules`, `path` fragments can now be parsed as type parameter
bounds][38279]
\* [`?Sized` can be used in `where` clauses][37791]
\* [There is now a limit on the size of monomorphized types and it can be
modified with the `#![type\_size\_limit]` crate attribute, similarly to
the `#![recursion\_limit]` attribute][37789]
\* [On Windows, the compiler will apply dllimport attributes when linking
to extern functions][37973]. Additional attributes and flags can control
which library kind is linked and its name. [RFC 1717].
\* [Rust-ABI symbols are no longer exported from cdylibs][38117]
\* [The `--test` flag works with procedural macro crates][38107]
\* [Fix `extern "aapcs" fn` ABI][37814]
\* [The `-C no-stack-check` flag is deprecated][37636]. It does nothing.
\* [The `format!` expander recognizes incorrect `printf` and shell-style
formatting directives and suggests the correct format][37613].
\* [Only report one error for all unused imports in an import list][37456]
\* [Avoid unnecessary `mk\_ty` calls in `Ty::super\_fold\_with`][37705]
\* [Avoid more unnecessary `mk\_ty` calls in `Ty::super\_fold\_with`][37979]
\* [Don't clone in `UnificationTable::probe`][37848]
\* [Remove `scope\_auxiliary` to cut RSS by 10%][37764]
\* [Use small vectors in type walker][37760]
\* [Macro expansion performance was improved][37701]
\* [Change `HirVec<P<T>>` to `HirVec<T>` in `hir::Expr`][37642]
\* [Replace FNV with a faster hash function][37229]

Subject: [CVE-2020-1967] OpenSSL 1.1.1d+ Segmentation fault in SSL_check_chain

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

OpenSSL Security Advisory [21 April 2020]
=========================================

Segmentation fault in SSL_check_chain (CVE-2020-1967)
=====================================================

Severity: High

Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or
after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a
result of incorrect handling of the "signature_algorithms_cert" TLS extension.
The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received
from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of
Service attack.

OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue.  This
issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d.

Affected OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to 1.1.1g

This issue was found by Bernd Edlinger and reported to OpenSSL on 7th April
2020. It was found using the new static analysis pass being implemented in GCC,
- -fanalyzer. Additional analysis was performed by Matt Caswell and Benjamin
Kaduk.

Note
=====

This issue did not affect OpenSSL 1.0.2 however these versions are out of
support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended support is available
for premium support customers: <https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html>

This issue did not affect OpenSSL 1.1.0 however these versions are out of
support and no longer receiving updates.

Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

#### Description

Server or client applications that call the SSL\_check\_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the "signature\_algorithms\_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).

# Fulldisclosure -- Improving network security through full disclosure

## About Fulldisclosure

The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The [full disclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!

This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the [grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list](http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html) started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and [terminated abruptly in March 2014](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332) due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.

This list is run by and for the network security community. Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our [moderation guidelines](https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation). Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short. When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.

You must join the list before you can post to it. Submit posts to fulldisclosure@seclists.org. If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in [list config](https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure).

Posts are publicly archived at the [Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure) and the list RSS feed is available there too. Various unofficial archives exist as well. You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the [X-No-Archive mail header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive) in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.

Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk! In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.

## Using Fulldisclosure

To post a message to all the list members, send email to
fulldisclosure@seclists.org.

You can subscribe to the list, or change your existing
subscription, in the sections below.
## Subscribing to Fulldisclosure

Subscribe to Fulldisclosure by filling out the following
form.
You will be sent email requesting confirmation, to
prevent others from gratuitously subscribing you. This is a hidden list, which means that the
list of members is available only to the list administrator.

Your name (optional):

You may enter a
privacy password below. This provides only mild security,
but should prevent others from messing with your
subscription. **Do not use a valuable password** as
it will occasionally be emailed back to you in cleartext.

If you choose not to enter a password, one will be
automatically generated for you, and it will be sent to
you once you've confirmed your subscription. You can
always request a mail-back of your password when you edit
your personal options.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1154817#c0)  Ralf Haferkamp   2019-10-23 08:01:01 UTC  ``` I am currently trying to build <https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker.git> (but other rust project show the same issue) on tumbleweed and always get this:  ---------------------- ~/firecracker> cargo build      Updating crates.io index error: failed to fetch `<https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index>`  Caused by:   invalid version 3 on git_proxy_options; class=Invalid (3) ----------------------  Digging through the upstream bugs report I came accross: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63476>  Which points at an issue with the libgit2 integration. Which itself leads to <https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/issues/458>. I am by no means a rust expert but I if I understand correctly the recommendation is to build rust with the bundled libgit2 instead of using the system provide one. Which means we'd need to remove the LIBGIT2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1 from our spec files (AFAIU this is also how the package is build on Fedora)  Another possible fix is outlined here (and parently in use on FreeBSD): <https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=239785> using this patch: <https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/lang/rust-nightly/files/patch-vendor_libgit2-sys_lib.rs?view=log&pathrev=509173> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1154817#c1)  Ralf Haferkamp   2019-10-23 10:07:34 UTC  ``` I have created <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/742099> as a suggested fix. Feel free to take another approach. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1154817#c2)  Simon Renger   2019-11-01 14:37:49 UTC  ``` Also the case with cargo install  ------------------------------------------ simon@android-b88d2c9030cc7b02:~/git/quest-api> cargo install actix-web     Updating crates.io index error: failed to fetch `<https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index>`  Caused by:   invalid version 3 on git_proxy_options; class=Invalid (3) ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1154817#c3)  Ralf Haferkamp   2020-02-27 16:55:53 UTC  ``` The suggested fix was merged a while ago. So I guess we can close this. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154817#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-07-06 16:13:58 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0933-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes is now available.

openSUSE Leap 15.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for rust, rust-cbindgen fixes the following issues:
rust was updated for use by Firefox 76ESR.
- Fixed miscompilations with rustc 1.43 that lead to LTO failures
(bsc#1173202)
Update to version 1.43.1
- Updated openssl-src to 1.1.1g for CVE-2020-1967.
- Fixed the stabilization of AVX-512 features.
- Fixed `cargo package --list` not working with unpublished dependencies.
Update to version 1.43.0
+ Language:
- Fixed using binary operations with `&{number}` (e.g. `&1.0`) not having
the type inferred correctly.
- Attributes such as `#[cfg()]` can now be used on `if` expressions.
- Syntax only changes:
\* Allow `type Foo: Ord` syntactically.
\* Fuse associated and extern items up to defaultness.
\* Syntactically allow `self` in all `fn` contexts.
\* Merge `fn` syntax + cleanup item parsing.
\* `item` macro fragments can be interpolated into `trait`s, `impl`s, and
`extern` blocks. For example, you may now write: ```rust macro\_rules!
mac\_trait { ($i:item) => { trait T { $i } } } mac\_trait! { fn foo() {}
} ```
\* These are still rejected \*semantically\*, so you will likely receive an
error but these changes can be seen and parsed by macros and
conditional compilation.
+ Compiler
- You can now pass multiple lint flags to rustc to override the previous
flags.
For example; `rustc -D unused -A unused-variables` denies everything in
the `unused` lint group except `unused-variables` which is explicitly
allowed. However, passing `rustc -A unused-variables -D unused` denies
everything in the `unused` lint group \*\*including\*\* `unused-variables`
since the allow flag is specified before the deny flag (and therefore
overridden).
- rustc will now prefer your system MinGW libraries over its bundled
libraries if they are available on `windows-gnu`.
- rustc now buffers errors/warnings printed in JSON.
Libraries:
- `Arc<[T; N]>`, `Box<[T; N]>`, and `Rc<[T; N]>`, now implement
`TryFrom<Arc<[T]>>`,`TryFrom<Box<[T]>>`, and `TryFrom<Rc<[T]>>`
respectively.
\*\*Note\*\* These conversions are only available when `N` is `0..=32`.
- You can now use associated constants on floats and integers directly,
rather than having to import the module. e.g. You can now write
`u32::MAX` or `f32::NAN` with no imports.
- `u8::is\_ascii` is now `const`.
- `String` now implements `AsMut<str>`.
- Added the `primitive` module to `std` and `core`. This module reexports
Rust's primitive types. This is mainly useful in macros where you want
avoid these types being shadowed.
- Relaxed some of the trait bounds on `HashMap` and `HashSet`.
- `string::FromUtf8Error` now implements `Clone + Eq`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- `Once::is\_completed`
- `f32::LOG10\_2`
- `f32::LOG2\_10`
- `f64::LOG10\_2`
- `f64::LOG2\_10`
- `iter::once\_with`
+ Cargo
- You can now set config `[profile]`s in your `.cargo/config`,
or through your environment.
- Cargo will now set `CARGO\_BIN\_EXE\_<name>` pointing to a binary's
executable path when running integration tests or benchmarks. `<name>`
is the name of your binary as-is e.g. If you wanted the executable
path for a binary named `my-program`you would use
`env!("CARGO\_BIN\_EXE\_my-program")`.
+ Misc
- Certain checks in the `const\_err` lint were deemed unrelated to const
evaluation, and have been moved to the `unconditional\_panic` and
`arithmetic\_overflow` lints.
+ Compatibility Notes
- Having trailing syntax in the `assert!` macro is now a hard error.
This has been a warning since 1.36.0.
- Fixed `Self` not having the correctly inferred type. This incorrectly
led to some instances being accepted, and now correctly emits a hard
error.
Update to version 1.42.0:
+ Language
- You can now use the slice pattern syntax with subslices.
- You can now use #[repr(transparent)] on univariant enums. Meaning that
you can create an enum that has the exact layout and ABI of the type
it contains.
- There are some syntax-only changes:
\* default is syntactically allowed before items in trait definitions.
\* Items in impls (i.e. consts, types, and fns) may syntactically leave
out their bodies in favor of ;.
\* Bounds on associated types in impls are now syntactically allowed
(e.g. type Foo: Ord;).
\* ... (the C-variadic type) may occur syntactically directly as the
type of any function parameter. These are still rejected
semantically, so you will likely receive an error but these changes
can be seen and parsed by procedural macros and conditional
compilation.
+ Compiler
- Added tier 2 support for armv7a-none-eabi.
- Added tier 2 support for riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu.
- Option::{expect,unwrap} and Result::{expect, expect\_err, unwrap,
unwrap\_err} now produce panic messages pointing to the location where
they were called, rather than core's internals. Refer to Rust's
platform support page for more information on Rust's tiered platform
support.
+ Libraries
- iter::Empty<T> now implements Send and Sync for any T.
- Pin::{map\_unchecked, map\_unchecked\_mut} no longer require the return
type to implement Sized.
- io::Cursor now derives PartialEq and Eq.
- Layout::new is now const.
- Added Standard Library support for riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu.
+ Stabilized APIs
- CondVar::wait\_while
- CondVar::wait\_timeout\_while
- DebugMap::key
- DebugMap::value
- ManuallyDrop::take
- matches!
- ptr::slice\_from\_raw\_parts\_mut
- ptr::slice\_from\_raw\_parts
+ Cargo
- You no longer need to include extern crate proc\_macro; to be able to
use proc\_macro; in the 2018 edition.
+ Compatibility Notes
- Error::description has been deprecated, and its use will now produce a
warning. It's recommended to use Display/to\_string instead.
Update to version 1.41.1:
- Always check types of static items
- Always check lifetime bounds of `Copy` impls
- Fix miscompilation in callers of `Layout::repeat`
Update to version 1.41.0:
+ Language
- You can now pass type parameters to foreign items when implementing
traits. E.g. You can now write `impl<T> From<Foo> for Vec<T> {}`.
- You can now arbitrarily nest receiver types in the `self` position.
E.g. you can now write `fn foo(self: Box<Box<Self>>) {}`. Previously
only `Self`, `&Self`, `&mut Self`, `Arc<Self>`, `Rc<Self>`, and
`Box<Self>` were allowed.
- You can now use any valid identifier in a `format\_args` macro.
Previously identifiers starting with an underscore were not allowed.
- Visibility modifiers (e.g. `pub`) are now syntactically allowed on
trait items and enum variants. These are still rejected semantically,
but can be seen and parsed by procedural macros and conditional
compilation.
+ Compiler
- Rustc will now warn if you have unused loop `'label`s.
- Removed support for the `i686-unknown-dragonfly` target.
- Added tier 3 support\\* for the `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` target.
- You can now pass an arguments file passing the `@path` syntax to
rustc. Note that the format differs somewhat from what is found in
other tooling; please see the documentation for more information.
- You can now provide `--extern` flag without a path, indicating that it
is available from the search path or specified with an `-L` flag.
Refer to Rust's [platform support page][forge-platform-support] for more
information on Rust's tiered platform support.
+ Libraries
- The `core::panic` module is now stable. It was already stable through
`std`.
- `NonZero\*` numerics now implement `From<NonZero\*>` if it's a smaller
integer width. E.g. `NonZeroU16` now implements `From<NonZeroU8>`.
- `MaybeUninit<T>` now implements `fmt::Debug`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- `Result::map\_or`
- `Result::map\_or\_else`
- `std::rc::Weak::weak\_count`
- `std::rc::Weak::strong\_count`
- `std::sync::Weak::weak\_count`
- `std::sync::Weak::strong\_count`
+ Cargo
- Cargo will now document all the private items for binary crates by
default.
- `cargo-install` will now reinstall the package if it detects that it
is out
of date.
- Cargo.lock now uses a more git friendly format that should help to
reduce merge conflicts.
- You can now override specific dependencies's build settings. E.g.
`[profile.dev.package.image] opt-level = 2` sets the `image` crate's
optimisation level to `2` for debug builds. You can also use
`[profile.<profile>.build-override]` to override build scripts and
their dependencies.
+ Misc
- You can now specify `edition` in documentation code blocks to compile
the block for that edition. E.g. `edition2018` tells rustdoc that the
code sample should be compiled the 2018 edition of Rust.
- You can now provide custom themes to rustdoc with `--theme`, and check
the current theme with `--check-theme`.
- You can use `#[cfg(doc)]` to compile an item when building
documentation.
+ Compatibility Notes
- As previously announced 1.41.0 will be the last tier 1 release for
32-bit Apple targets. This means that the source code is still
available to build, but the targets are no longer being tested and
release binaries for those platforms will no longer be distributed by
the Rust project. Please refer to the linked blog post for more
information.
- Bump version of libssh2 for SLE15; we now need a version with
libssh2\_userauth\_publickey\_frommemory(), which appeared in libssh2 1.6.0.
Update to version 1.40.0
+ Language
- You can now use tuple `struct`s and tuple `enum` variant's
constructors in `const` contexts. e.g. pub struct Point(i32, i32);
const ORIGIN: Point = { let constructor = Point; constructor(0, 0) };
- You can now mark `struct`s, `enum`s, and `enum` variants with the
`#[non\_exhaustive]` attribute to indicate that there may be variants
or fields added in the future. For example this requires adding a
wild-card branch (`\_ => {}`) to any match statements on a
non-exhaustive `enum`.
- You can now use function-like procedural macros in `extern` blocks and
in type positions. e.g. `type Generated = macro!();`
- Function-like and attribute procedural macros can now emit
`macro\_rules!` items, so you can now have your macros generate macros.
- The `meta` pattern matcher in `macro\_rules!` now correctly matches the
modern attribute syntax. For example `(#[$m:meta])` now matches
`#[attr]`, `#[attr{tokens}]`, `#[attr[tokens]]`, and `#[attr(tokens)]`.
+ Compiler
- Added tier 3 support\\* for the `thumbv7neon-unknown-linux-musleabihf`
target.
- Added tier 3 support for the `aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat` target.
- Added tier 3 support for the `mips64-unknown-linux-muslabi64`, and
`mips64el-unknown-linux-muslabi64` targets.
+ Libraries
- The `is\_power\_of\_two` method on unsigned numeric types is now a
`const` function.
+ Stabilized APIs
- BTreeMap::get\_key\_value
- HashMap::get\_key\_value
- Option::as\_deref\_mut
- Option::as\_deref
- Option::flatten
- UdpSocket::peer\_addr
- f32::to\_be\_bytes
- f32::to\_le\_bytes
- f32::to\_ne\_bytes
- f64::to\_be\_bytes
- f64::to\_le\_bytes
- f64::to\_ne\_bytes
- f32::from\_be\_bytes
- f32::from\_le\_bytes
- f32::from\_ne\_bytes
- f64::from\_be\_bytes
- f64::from\_le\_bytes
- f64::from\_ne\_bytes
- mem::take
- slice::repeat
- todo!
+ Cargo
- Cargo will now always display warnings, rather than only on fresh
builds.
- Feature flags (except `--all-features`) passed to a virtual workspace
will now produce an error. Previously these flags were ignored.
- You can now publish `dev-dependencies` without including a `version`.
+ Misc
- You can now specify the `#[cfg(doctest)]` attribute to include an item
only when running documentation tests with `rustdoc`.
+ Compatibility Notes
- As previously announced, any previous NLL warnings in the 2015 edition
are now hard errors.
- The `include!` macro will now warn if it failed to include the entire
file. The `include!` macro unintentionally only includes the first
\_expression\_ in a file, and this can be unintuitive. This will become
either a hard error in a future release, or the behavior may be fixed
to include all expressions as expected.
- Using `#[inline]` on function prototypes and consts now emits a
warning under `unused\_attribute` lint. Using `#[inline]` anywhere else
inside traits
or `extern` blocks now correctly emits a hard error.
Update to version 1.39.0
+ Language
- You can now create async functions and blocks with async fn, async
move {}, and async {} respectively, and you can now call .await on
async expressions.
- You can now use certain attributes on function, closure, and function
pointer parameters.
- You can now take shared references to bind-by-move patterns in the if
guards of match arms.
+ Compiler
- Added tier 3 support for the i686-unknown-uefi target.
- Added tier 3 support for the sparc64-unknown-openbsd target.
- rustc will now trim code snippets in diagnostics to fit in your
terminal.
- You can now pass --show-output argument to test binaries to print the
output of successful tests.
+ For more details:
<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/stable/RELEASES.md#version-1390-2019>
-11-07
- Switch to bundled version of libgit2 for now. libgit2-sys seems to
expect using the bundled variant, which just seems to point to a
snapshot of the master branch and doesn't match any released libgit2
(bsc#1154817). See: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63476> and
<https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/issues/458> for details.
Update to version 1.38.0
+ Language
- The `#[global\_allocator]` attribute can now be used in submodules.
- The `#[deprecated]` attribute can now be used on macros.
+ Compiler
- Added pipelined compilation support to `rustc`. This will improve
compilation times in some cases.
+ Libraries
- `ascii::EscapeDefault` now implements `Clone` and `Display`.
- Derive macros for prelude traits (e.g. `Clone`, `Debug`, `Hash`) are
now available at the same path as the trait. (e.g. The `Clone` derive
macro is available at `std::clone::Clone`). This also makes all
built-in macros available in `std`/`core` root. e.g.
`std::include\_bytes!`.
- `str::Chars` now implements `Debug`.
- `slice::{concat, connect, join}` now accepts `&[T]` in addition to
`&T`.
- `\*const T` and `\*mut T` now implement `marker::Unpin`.
- `Arc<[T]>` and `Rc<[T]>` now implement `FromIterator<T>`.
- Added euclidean remainder and division operations (`div\_euclid`,
`rem\_euclid`) to all numeric primitives. Additionally `checked`,
`overflowing`, and `wrapping` versions are available for all integer
primitives.
- `thread::AccessError` now implements `Clone`, `Copy`, `Eq`, `Error`,
and `PartialEq`.
- `iter::{StepBy, Peekable, Take}` now implement `DoubleEndedIterator`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- `<\*const T>::cast`
- `<\*mut T>::cast`
- `Duration::as\_secs\_f32`
- `Duration::as\_secs\_f64`
- `Duration::div\_f32`
- `Duration::div\_f64`
- `Duration::from\_secs\_f32`
- `Duration::from\_secs\_f64`
- `Duration::mul\_f32`
- `Duration::mul\_f64`
- `any::type\_name`
+ Cargo
- Added pipelined compilation support to `cargo`.
- You can now pass the `--features` option multiple times to enable
multiple features.
+ Misc
- `rustc` will now warn about some incorrect uses of
`mem::{uninitialized, zeroed}` that are known to cause undefined
behaviour.
Update to version 1.37.0
+ Language
- #[must\_use] will now warn if the type is contained in a tuple, Box,
or an array and unused.
- You can now use the `cfg` and `cfg\_attr` attributes on generic
parameters.
- You can now use enum variants through type alias. e.g. You can write
the following: ``` type MyOption = Option<u8>; fn
increment\_or\_zero(x: MyOption) -> u8 { match x { MyOption::Some(y)
=> y + 1, MyOption::None => 0, } } ```
- You can now use `\_` as an identifier for consts. e.g. You can write
`const \_: u32 = 5;`.
- You can now use `#[repr(align(X)]` on enums.
- The `?` Kleene macro operator is now available in the 2015 edition.
+ Compiler
- You can now enable Profile-Guided Optimization with the `-C
profile-generate` and `-C profile-use` flags. For more information
on how to use profile guided optimization, please refer to the rustc
book.
- The `rust-lldb` wrapper script should now work again.
+ Libraries
- `mem::MaybeUninit<T>` is now ABI-compatible with `T`.
+ Stabilized APIs
- BufReader::buffer
- BufWriter::buffer
- Cell::from\_mut
- Cell<[T]>::as\_slice\_of\_cells
- Cell<slice>::as\_slice\_of\_cells
- DoubleEndedIterator::nth\_back
- Option::xor

- i64::reverse\_bits
- i8::reverse\_bits
- isize::reverse\_bits
- slice::copy\_within
- u128::reverse\_bits
- u16::reverse\_bits
- u32::reverse\_bits
- u64::reverse\_bits
- u8::reverse\_bits
- usize::reverse\_bits
+ Cargo
- Cargo.lock files are now included by default when publishing
executable crates with executables.
- You can now specify `default-run="foo"` in `[package]` to specify
the default executable to use for `cargo run`.
- cargo-vendor is now provided as a sub-command of cargo
+ Compatibility Notes
- Using `...` for inclusive range patterns will now warn by default.
Please transition your code to using the `..=` syntax for inclusive
ranges instead.
- Using a trait object without the `dyn` will now warn by default.
Please transition your code to use `dyn Trait` for trait objects
instead. Crab(String), Lobster(String), Person(String), let state =
Creature::Crab("Ferris"); if let Creature::Crab(name) |
Creature::Person(name) = state { println!("This creature's name is:
{}", name); } unsafe { foo() } pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Self {
Self(x, y) } pub fn is\_origin(&self) -> bool { match self { Self(0,
0) => true, \_ => false, } } Self: PartialOrd<Self> // can write
`Self` instead of `List<T>` Nil, Cons(T, Box<Self>) // likewise here
fn test(&self) { println!("one"); } //~ ERROR duplicate definitions
with name `test` fn test(&self) { println!("two"); }
\* Basic procedural macros allowing custom `#[derive]`, aka "macros 1.1",
are stable. This allows popular code-generating crates like Serde and
Diesel to work ergonomically. [RFC 1681].
\* [Tuple structs may be empty. Unary and empty tuple structs may be
instantiated with curly braces][36868]. Part of [RFC 1506].
\* [A number of minor changes to name resolution have been
activated][37127]. They add up to more consistent semantics, allowing
for future evolution of Rust macros. Specified in [RFC 1560], see its
section on ["changes"] for details of what is different. The breaking
changes here have been transitioned through the [`legacy\_imports`] lint
since 1.14, with no known regressions.
\* [In `macro\_rules`, `path` fragments can now be parsed as type parameter
bounds][38279]
\* [`?Sized` can be used in `where` clauses][37791]
\* [There is now a limit on the size of monomorphized types and it can be
modified with the `#![type\_size\_limit]` crate attribute, similarly to
the `#![recursion\_limit]` attribute][37789]
\* [On Windows, the compiler will apply dllimport attributes when linking
to extern functions][37973]. Additional attributes and flags can control
which library kind is linked and its name. [RFC 1717].
\* [Rust-ABI symbols are no longer exported from cdylibs][38117]
\* [The `--test` flag works with procedural macro crates][38107]
\* [Fix `extern "aapcs" fn` ABI][37814]
\* [The `-C no-stack-check` flag is deprecated][37636]. It does nothing.
\* [The `format!` expander recognizes incorrect `printf` and shell-style
formatting directives and suggests the correct format][37613].
\* [Only report one error for all unused imports in an import list][37456]
\* [Avoid unnecessary `mk\_ty` calls in `Ty::super\_fold\_with`][37705]
\* [Avoid more unnecessary `mk\_ty` calls in `Ty::super\_fold\_with`][37979]
\* [Don't clone in `UnificationTable::probe`][37848]
\* [Remove `scope\_auxiliary` to cut RSS by 10%][37764]
\* [Use small vectors in type walker][37760]
\* [Macro expansion performance was improved][37701]
\* [Change `HirVec<P<T>>` to `HirVec<T>` in `hir::Expr`][37642]
\* [Replace FNV with a faster hash function][37229]

###### high

* [Information](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-23840)
* [CPEs](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-23840/cpes)
* [Plugins](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-23840/plugins)

#### Description

Calls to EVP\_CipherUpdate, EVP\_EncryptUpdate and EVP\_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 329 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2739494.1).

**Please note that since the release of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle WebLogic Server: [CVE-2020-14750 (November 1, 2020)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2020-14750.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply this Critical Patch Update, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2725756.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2725756.1).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 444 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2684313.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 30 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2679563.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2679563.1).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

Starting with the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. Oracle has published two versions of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update Advisory: this version of the advisory implemented the change in how non-exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party components are reported, and the “traditional” advisory follows the same format as the previous advisories. The “traditional” advisory is published at <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020traditional.html>.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 403 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2712240.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.
