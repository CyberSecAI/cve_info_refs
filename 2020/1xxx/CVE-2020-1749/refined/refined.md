        "vulnerability": {
          "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's implementation of some networking protocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6, incorrectly routes tunneled data, sending it unencrypted instead of over the encrypted link.",

            "Incorrect routing of tunneled data in IPsec tunnels",
            "Lack of encryption for some IPv6 protocols over IPsec tunnels"
