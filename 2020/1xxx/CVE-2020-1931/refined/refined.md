  "CVE-2020-1931": {
    "description": "A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3. Carefully crafted nefarious Configuration (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. This issue is less stealthy and attempts to exploit the issue will throw warnings.  With this bug unpatched, exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios though doing so remotely is difficult. In addition to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only use update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of configuration (.cf) files allows for execution of arbitrary system commands.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insecure Configuration"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the spamd process.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploitation through malicious configuration (.cf) files."

        "Ability to introduce a malicious .cf file into the SpamAssassin configuration, typically by tricking a user or automated system into using it."
