Name : ansible
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 2.9.7
Release : 1.fc32

Ansible is a radically simple model-driven configuration management,
multi-node deployment, and remote task execution system. Ansible works

on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and
are transferred to managed machines automatically.

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-f80154b5b4
2020-04-27 04:47:02.527362
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : ansible
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 2.9.7
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://ansible.com>
Summary : SSH-based configuration management, deployment, and task execution system
Description :
Ansible is a radically simple model-driven configuration management,
multi-node deployment, and remote task execution system. Ansible works
over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed
on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and
are transferred to managed machines automatically.

## Package

pip

ansible
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.17
>= 2.8.0a1, < 2.8.11
>= 2.9.0a1, < 2.9.7

## Patched versions

2.7.17
2.8.11
2.9.7

## Description

A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when using Ansible Vault for editing encrypted files. When a user executes "ansible-vault edit", another user on the same computer can read the old and new secret, as it is created in a temporary file with mkstemp and the returned file descriptor is closed and the method write\_data is called to write the existing secret in the file. This method will delete the file before recreating it insecurely. All versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2020-1740](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vcg8-98q8-g7mj "CVE-2020-1740")

A race condition exists in `ansible-vault edit` which could allow another user on the same computer can read the old and new secret.

When executing `ansible-vault edit`, the method `VaultEditor._edit_file_helper()` creates the temporary file with `tempfile.mkstemp()`. However, the returned file descriptor is closed and `VaultEditor.write_data()` is called to write to the file. `VaultEditor.write_data()` will delete the file and recreate it. A malicious user can create the file with permissions allowing them access to the file after the unlink.

The proposed solution is to write directly to the file descriptor in `VaultEditor._edit_file_helper()` rather than deleting and creating a new file.

**Relevant code:**

[ansible/lib/ansible/parsing/vault/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/79dfae9624480f757795224732bfaa9ca1dd4543/lib/ansible/parsing/vault/__init__.py#L851-L859)

Package        : ansible
Version        : 1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14846 CVE-2020-1733 CVE-2020-1739 CVE-2020-1740
Debian Bug     : 942188

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment, and task execution system.

CVE-2019-14846

    Ansible was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure
    of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials
    at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as
    those are executed in a separate process.

CVE-2020-1733

    A race condition flaw was found when running a playbook with an
    unprivileged become user. When Ansible needs to run a module with
    become user, the temporary directory is created in /var/tmp. This
    directory is created with "umask 77 && mkdir -p dir"; this
    operation does not fail if the directory already exists and is
    owned by another user. An attacker could take advantage to gain
    control of the become user as the target directory can be
    retrieved by iterating '/proc/pid/cmdline'.

CVE-2020-1739

    A flaw was found when a password is set with the argument
    "password" of svn module, it is used on svn command line,
    disclosing to other users within the same node. An attacker could
    take advantage by reading the cmdline file from that particular
    PID on the procfs.

CVE-2020-1740

    A flaw was found when using Ansible Vault for editing encrypted
    files. When a user executes "ansible-vault edit", another user on
    the same computer can read the old and new secret, as it is
    created in a temporary file with mkstemp and the returned file
    descriptor is closed and the method write_data is called to write
    the existing secret in the file. This method will delete the file
    before recreating it insecurely.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

## Description

##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2020-1740](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vcg8-98q8-g7mj "CVE-2020-1740")

A race condition exists in `ansible-vault edit` which could allow another user on the same computer can read the old and new secret.

When executing `ansible-vault edit`, the method `VaultEditor._edit_file_helper()` creates the temporary file with `tempfile.mkstemp()`. However, the returned file descriptor is closed and `VaultEditor.write_data()` is called to write to the file. `VaultEditor.write_data()` will delete the file and recreate it. A malicious user can create the file with permissions allowing them access to the file after the unlink.

The proposed solution is to write directly to the file descriptor in `VaultEditor._edit_file_helper()` rather than deleting and creating a new file.

**Relevant code:**

[ansible/lib/ansible/parsing/vault/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/79dfae9624480f757795224732bfaa9ca1dd4543/lib/ansible/parsing/vault/__init__.py#L851-L859)
