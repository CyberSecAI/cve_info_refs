Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `openshift/template-service-broker-operator` container incorrectly modifies the permissions of `/etc/passwd`, making it writable by users other than root.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Insecure file permissions on `/etc/passwd` within the container.
- Modification of `/etc/passwd` can be performed by non-root users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker with access to the vulnerable container can modify the `/etc/passwd` file.
- This modification can be used to add a new user or modify an existing user with escalated privileges (e.g., by adding a user with UID 0, effectively making them a root user within the container).
- Privilege escalation within the container.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attacker needs access to a running instance of the affected `openshift/template-service-broker-operator` container.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker requires the ability to execute commands within the compromised container environment.

**Additional notes:**

- By default, unprivileged containers on OpenShift Container Platform are not directly exploitable due to the seccomp policy blocking SETUID and SETGID calls. However, modification of `/etc/passwd` could potentially be exploited by other means within the container context or in other environments.
- This issue has been addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 via RHSA-2020:0866 and in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 via RHBA-2020:1278.
