Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1912:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Facebook Hermes, a JavaScript engine, handles lazily compiled inner generator functions. When a generator function was large enough to be lazily compiled, information about whether it was an inner generator was lost during the reconstitution of the function's context. This led to the function being generated as a regular function instead of a generator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The core weakness is that the incorrect function type generation leads to an out-of-bounds read/write when the function is executed.
*   **Incorrect Function Context Restoration:** The core of the bug is in the logic that restores the function context during lazy compilation, specifically for inner generator functions, losing the generator flag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted JavaScript:** The attack vector is through crafted JavaScript code designed to trigger the vulnerability in the Hermes engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs the ability to have their malicious JavaScript code evaluated by a vulnerable instance of Hermes. This usually involves the application using Hermes permitting execution of untrusted JavaScript.
*   **Vulnerable Hermes Version:** The targeted Hermes instance must be prior to commit 091835377369c8fd5917d9b87acffa721ad2a168.
