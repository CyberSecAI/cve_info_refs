Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1914

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a logic error in how the `SaveGeneratorLong` instruction was handled within the Facebook Hermes JavaScript engine. Specifically, it would jump to the wrong next instruction based on the length of the `SaveGenerator` instruction which could be variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect control flow when handling `SaveGeneratorLong` instruction.
- Potential out-of-bounds read or arbitrary code execution due to incorrect instruction pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially read out of bounds memory.
- Theoretically, attackers could achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the incorrect control flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript code designed to trigger the flawed `SaveGeneratorLong` instruction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide untrusted JavaScript to be evaluated by the vulnerable Hermes engine.
- No user interaction or special privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the interpreter loop, specifically in the handling of `SaveGenerator` and `SaveGeneratorLong` instructions.
- The fix involves creating a callout function to handle the common case of saving generator state and dispatch within each case of the interpreter loop.
- The vulnerability is considered "critical" severity with a CVSS score of 9.8.
- The issue is related to a code logic error rather than a memory corruption bug.
