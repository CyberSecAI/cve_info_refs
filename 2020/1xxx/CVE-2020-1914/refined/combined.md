This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix [CVE-2020-1914](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-327c-qx3v-h673 "CVE-2020-1914") by using NEXTINST for SaveGeneratorLong

[Browse files](/facebook/hermes/tree/b2021df620824627f5a8c96615edbd1eb7fdddfc)

```
Summary:
If `SaveGeneratorLong` was emitted, it would accidentally jump to the
wrong next instruction, based on how long SaveGenerator was.

Make a callout function to handle the common case, and handle the dispatch
within each case of the interpreter loop.

Fixes [CVE-2020-1914](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-327c-qx3v-h673 "CVE-2020-1914")

0.7.2

## Description

A logic vulnerability when handling the SaveGeneratorLong instruction in Facebook Hermes prior to commit b2021df620824627f5a8c96615edbd1eb7fdddfc allows attackers to potentially read out of bounds or theoretically execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
