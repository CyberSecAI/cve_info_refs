- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software attempts to access an invalid pointer. This occurs when an operator logs into the device and performs certain operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Invalid pointer access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause a process reboot on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to log in to the device network as an operator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid operator credentials to log in to the device.
