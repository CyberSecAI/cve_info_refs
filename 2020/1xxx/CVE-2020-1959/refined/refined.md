Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Apache Syncope. Specifically, the application uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom constraint violation error messages, they support Java EL expressions for interpolation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions into the error message template.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary code via Java EL expressions in the error message template.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input used in error message templates. This lack of input validation allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through injecting arbitrary data into the error message template. Since this vulnerability is unauthenticated, an attacker doesn't need to log in and could exploit this weakness by providing malicious input in places where error messages would be constructed with user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability. The weakness exists in how error messages are constructed using user-provided input.
- **Knowledge of Injection Points:** An attacker needs to identify the vulnerable areas within the application that utilize Java EL expressions for error message generation and where they can inject malicious data.
