  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-1942",
    "description": "The flow fingerprint factory generated flow fingerprints which included sensitive property descriptor values. In the event a node attempted to join a cluster and the cluster flow was not inheritable, the flow fingerprint of both the cluster and local flow was printed, potentially containing sensitive values in plaintext. NiFi 1.11.1i implemented Argon2 secure hashing to provide a deterministic loggable value which does not reveal the sensitive value. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to 1.11.1.",
    "root_cause": "The flow fingerprint factory included sensitive property descriptor values in the generated flow fingerprints, which were then printed to logs.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive property descriptor values in plaintext within application logs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A node attempting to join a cluster when the cluster flow is not inheritable",
       "Exposure of the flow fingerprint in the logs during cluster synchronization"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have access to the application logs to view the sensitive information."
