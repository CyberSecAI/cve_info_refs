- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application did not properly validate the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header, which can be set by the client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, specifically not sanitizing the X-Forwarded-For header. This allows an attacker to spoof their IP address.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can spoof their IP address, thus bypassing IP address checks and gaining unauthorized access. This can potentially lead to other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request and includes a forged IP address in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Moodle server. They do not need to be authenticated. The attacker can be external.
