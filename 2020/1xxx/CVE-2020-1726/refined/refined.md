  "CVE-2020-1726": {
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in Podman where it incorrectly allows containers when created to overwrite existing files in volumes, even if they are mounted as read-only. When a user runs a malicious container or a container based on a malicious image with an attached volume that is used for the first time, it is possible to trigger the flaw and overwrite files in the volume. This issue was introduced in version 1.6.0.",
    "affected_components": [
      "podman",
      "libpod"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the way Podman handles volume creation and population. When a new container with a volume is created, Podman copies files from the container's root filesystem to the volume's directory. This operation occurs when `vol.state.NeedsCopyUp` is true, which is only the first time the volume is used. If a volume is already populated (i.e has existing data from previous use), the container can still write to the volume the first time it's mounted.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of volume creation and population",
        "Lack of check for volume emptiness before populating it with container data"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious container can overwrite existing files in a volume, even if the volume is mounted as read-only. This can lead to data loss or manipulation.",
    "attack_vector": "Attacker runs a malicious container or a container based on a malicious image with an attached volume. This only impacts the volume the very first time it's used.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious container or have a malicious container image, and the victim needs to mount the volume to the container in question."
