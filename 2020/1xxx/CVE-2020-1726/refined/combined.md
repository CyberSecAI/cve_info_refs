| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c0)  Balázs Németh   2020-03-04 21:58:04 UTC  ``` Hello Team,  I tried to migrate from OpenSUSE Leap 15.1 to MicroOS but I had network issues with pod to pod communication with podman. After some research and troubleshooting I ran into these comments: - <https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5316#issuecomment-590721132> - <https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5316#issuecomment-592057783>  I quickly checked the status on kernel module br_netfilter on my systems.  On OpenSUSE Leap 15.1 I have this. So as it is loaded.  # grep -rn br_netfilter /etc/ /etc/modprobe.d/00-system.conf:98:# Since kernel 3.18 br_netfilter is needed to pass bridged packets to /etc/modprobe.d/00-system.conf:99:# netfilter. Load br_netfilter automatically to avoid regressions in SLE12 SP2+ /etc/modprobe.d/00-system.conf:101:softdep bridge post: br_netfilter  However on MicroOS-20200301 I have nothing and it is not loaded. # grep -rn br_netfilter /etc/ #  As soon as I loaded the mentioned module, pod to pod networking started to work.  You may want to be aware of this situation.  If is there anything I can do to fix this please let me know.  Kind regards, Balázs NÉMETH ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c1)  Richard Brown   2020-03-05 15:41:28 UTC  ``` Working on it - thanks for the bug report! ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c2)  Richard Brown   2020-03-05 15:52:04 UTC  ``` Fixed in sr#781902  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/781902> ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-03-24 20:26:52 UTC  ``` SUSE-RU-2020:0776-1: An update that has one recommended fix can now be installed.

That said, I won't object if other people take care of a specific issue that impacts a different platform making use of the same package, but I believe that would be another bug for another bug tracker and another assignee. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c9)  Tomas Hehejik   2020-09-23 14:50:04 UTC  ``` I'm asking here because this bug is referenced in the incident for SLE (don't ask me why). ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c10)  Richard Brown   2020-09-23 14:53:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hehejik from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c9)) > I'm asking here because this bug is referenced in the incident for SLE > (don't ask me why).  That's fine..but your suggestion is not a relevant or appropriate fix for the platforms this bug is about..so, if you found a new issue specific to a platform unreleated to this bug report, I think that's when a new bug report makes sense  I don't inherit problems on platforms I am not responsible for just because the changelog references bugs for platforms I am responsible for :) ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1165738#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-09-24 10:14:05 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:2731-1: An update that solves one vulnerability, contains one feature and has 6 fixes is now available.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

An update that solves one vulnerability and has 6 fixes is
now available.
Description:
This update for conmon, fuse-overlayfs, libcontainers-common, podman fixes
the following issues:
podman was updated to v2.0.6 (bsc#1175821)
- install missing systemd units for the new Rest API (bsc#1175957) and a
few man-pages that where missing before
- Drop varlink API related bits (in favor of the new API)
- fix install location for zsh completions
\* Fixed a bug where running systemd in a container on a cgroups v1 system
would fail.
\* Fixed a bug where /etc/passwd could be re-created every time a
container is restarted if the container's /etc/passwd did not contain
an entry for the user the container was started as.
\* Fixed a bug where containers without an /etc/passwd file specifying a
non-root user would not start.
\* Fixed a bug where the --remote flag would sometimes not make remote
connections and would instead attempt to run Podman locally.
Update to v2.0.6:
\* Features
- Rootless Podman will now add an entry to /etc/passwd for the user who
ran Podman if run with --userns=keep-id.
- The podman system connection command has been reworked to support
multiple connections, and reenabled for use!
- Podman now has a new global flag, --connection, to specify a
connection to a remote Podman API instance.
\* Changes
- Podman's automatic systemd integration (activated by the
--systemd=true flag, set by default) will now activate for containers
using /usr/local/sbin/init as their command, instead of just
/usr/sbin/init and /sbin/init (and any path ending in systemd).
- Seccomp profiles specified by the --security-opt seccomp=... flag to
podman create and podman run will now be honored even if the container
was created using --privileged.
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the podman play kube would not honor the hostIP
field for port forwarding (#5964).
- Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd command would panic on
an invalid restart policy being specified (#7271).
- Fixed a bug where the podman images command could take a very long
time (several minutes) to complete when a large number of images were
present.
- Fixed a bug where the podman logs command with the --tail flag would
not work properly when a large amount of output would be printed
((#7230)[<https://github.com//issues/7230>]).
- Fixed a bug where the podman exec command with remote Podman would not
return a non-zero exit code when the exec session failed to start
(e.g. invoking a non-existent command) (#6893).
- Fixed a bug where the podman load command with remote Podman would did
not honor user-specified tags (#7124).
- Fixed a bug where the podman system service command, when run as a
non-root user by Systemd, did not properly handle the Podman pause
process and would not restart properly as a result (#7180).
- Fixed a bug where the --publish flag to podman create, podman run, and
podman pod create did not properly handle a host IP of 0.0.0.0
(attempting to bind to literal 0.0.0.0, instead of all IPs on the
system) (#7104).
- Fixed a bug where the podman start --attach command would not print
the container's exit code when the command exited due to the container
exiting.
- Fixed a bug where the podman rm command with remote Podman would not
remove volumes, even if the --volumes flag was specified (#7128).
- Fixed a bug where the podman run command with remote Podman and the
--rm flag could exit before the container was fully removed.
- Fixed a bug where the --pod new:... flag to podman run and podman
create would create a pod that did not share any namespaces.
- Fixed a bug where the --preserve-fds flag to podman run and podman
exec could close the wrong file descriptors while trying to close
user-provided descriptors after passing them into the container.
- Fixed a bug where default environment variables ($PATH and $TERM) were
not set in containers when not provided by the image.
- Fixed a bug where pod infra containers were not properly unmounted
after exiting.
- Fixed a bug where networks created with podman network create with an
IPv6 subnet did not properly set an IPv6 default route.
- Fixed a bug where the podman save command would not work properly when
its output was piped to another command (#7017).
- Fixed a bug where containers using a systemd init on a cgroups v1
system could leak mounts under /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd to the host.
- Fixed a bug where podman build would not generate an event on
completion (#7022).
- Fixed a bug where the podman history command with remote Podman
printed incorrect creation times for layers (#7122).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not create working directories
specified by the container image if they did not exist.
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not clear CMD from the container image if
the user overrode ENTRYPOINT (#7115).
- Fixed a bug where error parsing image names were not fully reported
(part of the error message containing the exact issue was dropped).
- Fixed a bug where the podman images command with remote Podman did not
support printing image tags in Go templates supplied to the --format
flag (#7123).
- Fixed a bug where the podman rmi --force command would not attempt to
unmount containers it was removing, which could cause a failure to
remove the image.
- Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd --new command could
incorrectly quote arguments to Podman that contained whitespace,
leading to nonfunctional unit files (#7285).
- Fixed a bug where the podman version command did not properly include
build time and Git commit.
- Fixed a bug where running systemd in a Podman container on a system
that did not use the systemd cgroup manager would fail (#6734).
- Fixed a bug where capabilities from --cap-add were not properly added
when a container was started as a non-root user via --user.
- Fixed a bug where Pod infra containers were not properly cleaned up
when they stopped, causing networking issues (#7103).
\* API
- Fixed a bug where the libpod and compat Build endpoints did not accept
the application/tar content type (instead only accepting
application/x-tar) (#7185).
- Fixed a bug where the libpod Exists endpoint would attempt to write a
second header in some error conditions (#7197).
- Fixed a bug where compat and libpod Network Inspect and Network Remove
endpoints would return a 500 instead of 404 when the requested network
was not found.
- Added a versioned \_ping endpoint (e.g. <http://localhost/v1.40/_ping>).
- Fixed a bug where containers started through a systemd-managed
instance of the REST API would be shut down when podman system service
shut down due to its idle timeout (#7294).
- Added stronger parameter verification for the libpod Network Create
endpoint to ensure subnet mask is a valid value.
- The Pod URL parameter to the Libpod Container List endpoint has been
deprecated; the information previously gated by the Pod boolean will
now be included in the response unconditionally.
- Change hard requires for AppArmor to Recommends. They are not needed for
runtime or with SELinux but already installed if AppArmor is used
[jsc#SMO-15]
- Add BuildRequires for pkg-config(libselinux) to build with SELinux
support [jsc#SMO-15]
Update to v2.0.4
\* Fixed a bug where the output of podman image search did not populate the
Description field as it was mistakenly assigned to the ID field.
\* Fixed a bug where podman build - and podman build on an HTTP target
would fail.
\* Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would improperly chown the copied-up
contents of anonymous volumes (#7130).
\* Fixed a bug where Podman would sometimes HTML-escape special characters
in its CLI output.
\* Fixed a bug where the podman start --attach --interactive command would
print the container ID of the container attached to when exiting (#7068).
\* Fixed a bug where podman run --ipc=host --pid=host would only set
--pid=host and not --ipc=host (#7100).
\* Fixed a bug where the --publish argument to podman run, podman create
and podman pod create would not allow binding the same container port to
more than one host port (#7062).
\* Fixed a bug where incorrect arguments to podman images --format could
cause Podman to segfault.
\* Fixed a bug where podman rmi --force on an image ID with more than one
name and at least one container using the image would not completely
remove containers using the image (#7153).
\* Fixed a bug where memory usage in bytes and memory use percentage were
swapped in the output of podman stats
--format=json.
\* Fixed a bug where the libpod and compat events endpoints would fail if
no filters were specified (#7078).
\* Fixed a bug where the CgroupVersion field in responses from the compat
Info endpoint was prefixed by "v" (instead of just being "1" or "2", as
is documented).
- Suggest katacontainers instead of recommending it. It's not enabled by
default, so it's just bloat

could cause them to not be overridden by a user-specified mount at the
same location
([#5219](<https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5219>))

opened
- make sure the destination is deleted before doing a rename(2). It
prevents a left over directory to cause delete to fail with EEXIST.
- honor --debug.
libcontainers-common was updated to fix:
- Fixes for %\_libexecdir changing to /usr/libexec (bsc#1174075)

- Update storage to 1.20.2
- Add back skip\_mount\_home
- Remove remaining difference between SLE and openSUSE package and ship
the some mounts.conf default configuration on both platforms. As the
sources for the mount point do not exist on openSUSE by default this
config will basically have no effect on openSUSE. (jsc#SLE-12122,
bsc#1175821)
- Update to image 5.4.4

never ended up in SLES and a different way to fix the underlying problem
is being worked on.
- Add registry.opensuse.org as default registry [bsc#1171578]
- Add /var/lib/ca-certificates/pem/SUSE.pem to the SLES mounts. This for
making container-suseconnect working in the public cloud on-demand
images. It needs that file for being able to verify the server
certificates of the RMT servers hosted in the public cloud.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:26:15 UTC  ``` podman incorrectly allows containers, when created, to populate volumes that already have existing data inside. A malicious container image may use this flaw to overwrite existing files in a volume, even if it is mounted in read-only mode. The attack is possible only the first time a volume is used.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:30:41 UTC  ``` Vulnerability introduced in upstream commit: <https://github.com/containers/libpod/commit/997c4b56ed2121726e966afe9a102ed16ba78f93>  First vulnerable upstream version is v1.6.0, which includes the above commit.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:33:18 UTC  ``` Function mountNamedVolume() is responsible for copying the content of the destination volume directory from the container to the volume. The copy (and the attack) happens only the first time because it is done when vol.state.NeedsCopyUp is True, which it is only at the beginning, since that field is set to False after perfoming the copy.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:36:29 UTC  ``` docker is not affected by this issue, even if it does support populating a volume using a container, as it checks whether the volume is empty before copying data from the container to the volume. Function populateVolumes() in create_unix.go of the docker code base is responsible for copying data from the container's rootfs into the volume. populateVolumes() calls CopyImagePathContent(), which in turn calls copyExistingContents() that checks whether the destination folder (the volume path) is empty or not.

An update that solves one vulnerability and has 6 fixes is
now available.
Description:
This update for conmon, fuse-overlayfs, libcontainers-common, podman fixes
the following issues:
podman was updated to v2.0.6 (bsc#1175821)
- install missing systemd units for the new Rest API (bsc#1175957) and a
few man-pages that where missing before
- Drop varlink API related bits (in favor of the new API)
- fix install location for zsh completions
\* Fixed a bug where running systemd in a container on a cgroups v1 system
would fail.
\* Fixed a bug where /etc/passwd could be re-created every time a
container is restarted if the container's /etc/passwd did not contain
an entry for the user the container was started as.
\* Fixed a bug where containers without an /etc/passwd file specifying a
non-root user would not start.
\* Fixed a bug where the --remote flag would sometimes not make remote
connections and would instead attempt to run Podman locally.
Update to v2.0.6:
\* Features
- Rootless Podman will now add an entry to /etc/passwd for the user who
ran Podman if run with --userns=keep-id.
- The podman system connection command has been reworked to support
multiple connections, and reenabled for use!
- Podman now has a new global flag, --connection, to specify a
connection to a remote Podman API instance.
\* Changes
- Podman's automatic systemd integration (activated by the
--systemd=true flag, set by default) will now activate for containers
using /usr/local/sbin/init as their command, instead of just
/usr/sbin/init and /sbin/init (and any path ending in systemd).
- Seccomp profiles specified by the --security-opt seccomp=... flag to
podman create and podman run will now be honored even if the container
was created using --privileged.
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the podman play kube would not honor the hostIP
field for port forwarding (#5964).
- Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd command would panic on
an invalid restart policy being specified (#7271).
- Fixed a bug where the podman images command could take a very long
time (several minutes) to complete when a large number of images were
present.
- Fixed a bug where the podman logs command with the --tail flag would
not work properly when a large amount of output would be printed
((#7230)[<https://github.com//issues/7230>]).
- Fixed a bug where the podman exec command with remote Podman would not
return a non-zero exit code when the exec session failed to start
(e.g. invoking a non-existent command) (#6893).
- Fixed a bug where the podman load command with remote Podman would did
not honor user-specified tags (#7124).
- Fixed a bug where the podman system service command, when run as a
non-root user by Systemd, did not properly handle the Podman pause
process and would not restart properly as a result (#7180).
- Fixed a bug where the --publish flag to podman create, podman run, and
podman pod create did not properly handle a host IP of 0.0.0.0
(attempting to bind to literal 0.0.0.0, instead of all IPs on the
system) (#7104).
- Fixed a bug where the podman start --attach command would not print
the container's exit code when the command exited due to the container
exiting.
- Fixed a bug where the podman rm command with remote Podman would not
remove volumes, even if the --volumes flag was specified (#7128).
- Fixed a bug where the podman run command with remote Podman and the
--rm flag could exit before the container was fully removed.
- Fixed a bug where the --pod new:... flag to podman run and podman
create would create a pod that did not share any namespaces.
- Fixed a bug where the --preserve-fds flag to podman run and podman
exec could close the wrong file descriptors while trying to close
user-provided descriptors after passing them into the container.
- Fixed a bug where default environment variables ($PATH and $TERM) were
not set in containers when not provided by the image.
- Fixed a bug where pod infra containers were not properly unmounted
after exiting.
- Fixed a bug where networks created with podman network create with an
IPv6 subnet did not properly set an IPv6 default route.
- Fixed a bug where the podman save command would not work properly when
its output was piped to another command (#7017).
- Fixed a bug where containers using a systemd init on a cgroups v1
system could leak mounts under /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd to the host.
- Fixed a bug where podman build would not generate an event on
completion (#7022).
- Fixed a bug where the podman history command with remote Podman
printed incorrect creation times for layers (#7122).
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not create working directories
specified by the container image if they did not exist.
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not clear CMD from the container image if
the user overrode ENTRYPOINT (#7115).
- Fixed a bug where error parsing image names were not fully reported
(part of the error message containing the exact issue was dropped).
- Fixed a bug where the podman images command with remote Podman did not
support printing image tags in Go templates supplied to the --format
flag (#7123).
- Fixed a bug where the podman rmi --force command would not attempt to
unmount containers it was removing, which could cause a failure to
remove the image.
- Fixed a bug where the podman generate systemd --new command could
incorrectly quote arguments to Podman that contained whitespace,
leading to nonfunctional unit files (#7285).
- Fixed a bug where the podman version command did not properly include
build time and Git commit.
- Fixed a bug where running systemd in a Podman container on a system
that did not use the systemd cgroup manager would fail (#6734).
- Fixed a bug where capabilities from --cap-add were not properly added
when a container was started as a non-root user via --user.
- Fixed a bug where Pod infra containers were not properly cleaned up
when they stopped, causing networking issues (#7103).
\* API
- Fixed a bug where the libpod and compat Build endpoints did not accept
the application/tar content type (instead only accepting
application/x-tar) (#7185).
- Fixed a bug where the libpod Exists endpoint would attempt to write a
second header in some error conditions (#7197).
- Fixed a bug where compat and libpod Network Inspect and Network Remove
endpoints would return a 500 instead of 404 when the requested network
was not found.
- Added a versioned \_ping endpoint (e.g. <http://localhost/v1.40/_ping>).
- Fixed a bug where containers started through a systemd-managed
instance of the REST API would be shut down when podman system service
shut down due to its idle timeout (#7294).
- Added stronger parameter verification for the libpod Network Create
endpoint to ensure subnet mask is a valid value.
- The Pod URL parameter to the Libpod Container List endpoint has been
deprecated; the information previously gated by the Pod boolean will
now be included in the response unconditionally.
- Change hard requires for AppArmor to Recommends. They are not needed for
runtime or with SELinux but already installed if AppArmor is used
[jsc#SMO-15]
- Add BuildRequires for pkg-config(libselinux) to build with SELinux
support [jsc#SMO-15]
Update to v2.0.4
\* Fixed a bug where the output of podman image search did not populate the
Description field as it was mistakenly assigned to the ID field.
\* Fixed a bug where podman build - and podman build on an HTTP target
would fail.
\* Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would improperly chown the copied-up
contents of anonymous volumes (#7130).
\* Fixed a bug where Podman would sometimes HTML-escape special characters
in its CLI output.
\* Fixed a bug where the podman start --attach --interactive command would
print the container ID of the container attached to when exiting (#7068).
\* Fixed a bug where podman run --ipc=host --pid=host would only set
--pid=host and not --ipc=host (#7100).
\* Fixed a bug where the --publish argument to podman run, podman create
and podman pod create would not allow binding the same container port to
more than one host port (#7062).
\* Fixed a bug where incorrect arguments to podman images --format could
cause Podman to segfault.
\* Fixed a bug where podman rmi --force on an image ID with more than one
name and at least one container using the image would not completely
remove containers using the image (#7153).
\* Fixed a bug where memory usage in bytes and memory use percentage were
swapped in the output of podman stats
--format=json.
\* Fixed a bug where the libpod and compat events endpoints would fail if
no filters were specified (#7078).
\* Fixed a bug where the CgroupVersion field in responses from the compat
Info endpoint was prefixed by "v" (instead of just being "1" or "2", as
is documented).
- Suggest katacontainers instead of recommending it. It's not enabled by
default, so it's just bloat

panic and dump core due to a concurrency issue (#6018)
\* Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could race when opening the rootless
user namespace, resulting in commands failing to run
\* Fixed a bug where HTTP proxy environment variables forwarded into the
container by the --http-proxy flag could not be overridden by --env or
--env-file
\* Fixed a bug where rootless Podman was setting resource limits on cgroups
v2 systems that were not using systemd-managed cgroups (and thus did not
support resource limits), resulting in containers failing to start
Update podman to v1.9.1:
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where healthchecks could become nonfunctional if container
log paths were manually set with --log-path and multiple container
logs were placed in the same directory
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could, when using an older
libpod.conf, print numerous warning messages about an invalid CGroup
manager config
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would sometimes fail to close the
rootless user namespace when joining it
Update podman to v1.9.0:
\* Features
- Experimental support has been added for podman run
--userns=auto, which automatically allocates a unique UID and GID
range for the new container's user namespace
- The podman play kube command now has a --network flag to place the
created pod in one or more CNI networks
- The podman commit command now supports an --iidfile flag to write the
ID of the committed image to a file
- Initial support for the new containers.conf configuration file has
been added. containers.conf allows for much more detailed
configuration of some Podman functionality
\* Changes
- There has been a major cleanup of the podman info command resulting in
breaking changes. Many fields have been renamed to better suit usage
with APIv2
- All uses of the --timeout flag have been switched to prefer the
alternative --time. The --timeout flag will continue to work, but man
pages and --help will use the --time flag instead
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where some volume mounts from the host would sometimes not
properly determine the flags they should use when mounting
- Fixed a bug where Podman was not propagating $PATH to Conmon and the
OCI runtime, causing issues for some OCI runtimes that required it
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would print error messages about
missing support for systemd cgroups when run in a container with no
cgroup support
- Fixed a bug where podman play kube would not properly handle
container-only port mappings (#5610)
- Fixed a bug where the podman container prune command was not pruning
containers in the created and configured states
- Fixed a bug where Podman was not properly removing CNI IP address
allocations after a reboot (#5433)
- Fixed a bug where Podman was not properly applying the default Seccomp
profile when --security-opt was not given at the command line
\* HTTP API
- Many Libpod API endpoints have been added, including Changes,
Checkpoint, Init, and Restore
- Resolved issues where the podman system service command would time out
and exit while there were still active connections
- Stability overall has greatly improved as we prepare the API for a
beta release soon with Podman 2.0
\* Misc
- The default infra image for pods has been upgraded to
k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2 (from 3.1) to address a bug in the architecture
metadata for non-AMD64 images
- The slirp4netns networking utility in rootless Podman now uses Seccomp
filtering where available for improved security
- Updated Buildah to v1.14.8
- Updated containers/storage to v1.18.2
- Updated containers/image to v5.4.3
- Updated containers/common to v0.8.1
- Add "systemd" BUILDFLAGS to build with support for journald logging
(bsc#1162432)
Update podman to v1.8.2:
\* Features
- Initial support for automatically updating containers managed via
Systemd unit files has been merged. This allows containers to
automatically upgrade if a newer version of their image becomes
available
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where unit files generated by podman generate systemd
--new would not force containers to detach, causing the unit to time
out when trying to start
- Fixed a bug where podman system reset could delete important system
directories if run as rootless on installations created by older
Podman (#4831)
- Fixed a bug where image built by podman build would not properly set
the OS and Architecture they were built with (#5503)
- Fixed a bug where attached podman run with --sig-proxy enabled (the
default), when built with Go 1.14, would repeatedly send signal 23 to
the process in the container and could generate errors when the
container stopped (#5483)
- Fixed a bug where rootless podman run commands could hang when
forwarding ports
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not work when /proc was
mounted with the hidepid option set
- Fixed a bug where the podman system service command would use large
amounts of CPU when --timeout was set to 0 (#5531)
\* HTTP API
- Initial support for Libpod endpoints related to creating and
operating on image manifest lists has been added
- The Libpod Healthcheck and Events API endpoints are now supported

\* Features
- Many networking-related flags have been added to podman pod create to
enable customization of pod networks, including
--add-host, --dns, --dns-opt, --dns-search, --ip,
--mac-address, --network, and --no-hosts
- The podman ps --format=json command now includes the ID of the image
containers were created with
- The podman run and podman create commands now feature an
--rmi flag to remove the image the container was using after it exits
(if no other containers are using said image)
([#4628](<https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4628>))
- The podman create and podman run commands now support the
--device-cgroup-rule flag (#4876)
- While the HTTP API remains in alpha, many fixes and additions have
landed. These are documented in a separate subsection below
- The podman create and podman run commands now feature a
--no-healthcheck flag to disable healthchecks for a container (#5299)
- Containers now recognize the io.containers.capabilities label, which
specifies a list of capabilities required by the image to run. These
capabilities will be used as long as they are more restrictive than
the default capabilities used
- YAML produced by the podman generate kube command now includes SELinux
configuration passed into the container via
--security-opt label=... (#4950)
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed CVE-2020-1726, a security issue where volumes manually populated
before first being mounted into a container could have those contents
overwritten on first being mounted into a container
- Fixed a bug where Podman containers with user namespaces in CNI
networks with the DNS plugin enabled would not have the DNS plugin's
nameserver added to their resolv.conf
([#5256](<https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5256>))
- Fixed a bug where trailing / characters in image volume definitions
could cause them to not be overridden by a user-specified mount at the
same location
([#5219](<https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5219>))
- Fixed a bug where the label option in libpod.conf, used to disable
SELinux by default, was not being respected (#5087)
- Fixed a bug where the podman login and podman logout commands required
the registry to log into be specified (#5146)
- Fixed a bug where detached rootless Podman containers could not
forward ports (#5167)
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to run if the pause
process had died
- Fixed a bug where Podman ignored labels that were specified with only
a key and no value (#3854)
- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to create named volumes when the
backing filesystem did not support SELinux labelling (#5200)

configuration, including volumes, working directory, labels, and stop
signal (#5174)
- Fixed a bug where the Created and CreatedTime fields in podman images
--format=json were misnamed, which also broke Go template output for
those fields

of memory when the log file for a container was large (#5131)
- Fixed a bug where Podman would sometimes incorrectly generate firewall
rules on systems using firewalld
- Fixed a bug where the podman inspect command would not display network
information for containers properly if a container joined multiple CNI
networks ([#4907](<https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4907>))
- Fixed a bug where the --uts flag to podman create and podman run would
only allow specifying containers by full ID (#5289)
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could segfault when passed a large
number of file descriptors
- Fixed a bug where the podman port command was incorrectly interpreting
additional arguments as container names, instead
of port numbers
- Fixed a bug where units created by podman generate systemd did not
depend on network targets, and so could start before the system
network was ready (#4130)
- Fixed a bug where exec sessions in containers which did not specify a
user would not inherit supplemental groups added to the container via
--group-add
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not respect the $TMPDIR environment
variable for placing large temporary files during some operations
(e.g. podman pull)

CreatedSince as part of the fix for (#5110). Go templates using the
old name shou ld still work
- The CreatedTime field to podman images --format=json has been renamed
to CreatedAt as part of the fix for (#5110). Go templates using the
old name should still work
- The before filter to podman images has been renamed to since for
Docker compatibility. Using before will still work, but documentation
has been changed to use the new since filter
- Using the --password flag to podman login now warns that passwords are
being passed in plaintext
- Some common cases where Podman would deadlock have been fixed to warn
the user that podman system renumber must be run to resolve the
deadlock
- Configure br\_netfilter for podman automatically (bsc#1165738) The
trigger is only excuted when updating podman-cni-config while the
command was running
conmon was update to v2.0.20 (bsc#1175821)
- journald: fix logging container name
- container logging: Implement none driver - "off", "null" or "none" all
work.
- ctrl: warn if we fail to unlink
- Drop fsync calls
- Reap PIDs before running exit command
- Fix log path parsing
- Add --sync option to prevent conmon from double forking
- Add --no-sync-log option to instruct conmon to not sync the logs of the
containers upon shutting down. This feature fixes a regression where we
unconditionally dropped the log sync. It is possible the container logs
could be corrupted on a sudden power-off. If you need container logs to
remain in consistent state after a sudden shutdown, please update from
v2.0.19 to v2.0.20
- Update to v2.0.17:
- Add option to delay execution of exit command
- Update to v2.0.16:
- tty: flush pending data when fd is ready
- Enable support for journald logging (bsc#1162432)
- Update to v2.0.15:
- store status while waiting for pid
- Update to v2.0.14:
- drop usage of splice(2)
- avoid hanging on stdin
- stdio: sometimes quit main loop after io is done
- ignore sigpipe
- Update to v2.0.12
- oom: fix potential race between verification steps
- Update to v2.0.11
- log: reject --log-tag with k8s-file
- chmod std files pipes
- adjust score to -1000 to prevent conmon from ever being OOM killed
- container OOM: verify cgroup hasn't been cleaned up before reporting
OOM
- journal logging: write to /dev/null instead of -1
fuse-overlayfs was updated to 1.1.2 (bsc#1175821):
- fix memory leak when creating whiteout files.
- fix lookup for overflow uid when it is different than the overflow gid.
- use openat2(2) when available.
- accept "ro" as mount option.
- fix set mtime for a symlink.
- fix some issues reported by static analysis.
- fix potential infinite loop on a short read.
- fix creating a directory if the destination already exists in the upper
layer.
- report correctly the number of links for a directory also for subsequent
stat calls
- stop looking up the ino in the lower layers if the file could not be
opened
- make sure the destination is deleted before doing a rename(2). It
prevents a left over directory to cause delete to fail with EEXIST.
- honor --debug.
libcontainers-common was updated to fix:
- Fixes for %\_libexecdir changing to /usr/libexec (bsc#1174075)
- Added containers/common tarball for containers.conf(5) man page
- Install containers.conf default configuration in /usr/share/containers
- libpod repository on github got renamed to podman
- Update to image 5.5.1
- Add documentation for credHelpera
- Add defaults for using the rootless policy path
- Update libpod/podman to 2.0.3
- docs: user namespace can't be shared in pods
- Switch references from libpod.conf to containers.conf
- Allow empty host port in --publish flag
- update document login see config.json as valid
- Update storage to 1.20.2
- Add back skip\_mount\_home
- Remove remaining difference between SLE and openSUSE package and ship
the some mounts.conf default configuration on both platforms. As the
sources for the mount point do not exist on openSUSE by default this
config will basically have no effect on openSUSE. (jsc#SLE-12122,
bsc#1175821)
- Update to image 5.4.4
- Remove registries.conf VERSION 2 references from man page
- Intial authfile man page
- Add $HOME/.config/containers/certs.d to perHostCertDirPath
- Add $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf to config path
- registries.conf.d: add stances for the registries.conf
- update to libpod 1.9.3

- Switch to using --time as opposed to --timeout to better match Docker
- Add support for specifying CNI networks in podman play kube
- man pages: fix inconsistencies
- Update to storage 1.19.1
- userns: add support for auto
- store: change the default user to containers
- config: honor XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME
- Remove the /var/lib/ca-certificates/pem/SUSE.pem workaround again. It
never ended up in SLES and a different way to fix the underlying problem
is being worked on.
- Add registry.opensuse.org as default registry [bsc#1171578]
- Add /var/lib/ca-certificates/pem/SUSE.pem to the SLES mounts. This for
making container-suseconnect working in the public cloud on-demand
images. It needs that file for being able to verify the server
certificates of the RMT servers hosted in the public cloud.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:26:15 UTC  ``` podman incorrectly allows containers, when created, to populate volumes that already have existing data inside. A malicious container image may use this flaw to overwrite existing files in a volume, even if it is mounted in read-only mode. The attack is possible only the first time a volume is used.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:30:41 UTC  ``` Vulnerability introduced in upstream commit: <https://github.com/containers/libpod/commit/997c4b56ed2121726e966afe9a102ed16ba78f93>  First vulnerable upstream version is v1.6.0, which includes the above commit.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:33:18 UTC  ``` Function mountNamedVolume() is responsible for copying the content of the destination volume directory from the container to the volume. The copy (and the attack) happens only the first time because it is done when vol.state.NeedsCopyUp is True, which it is only at the beginning, since that field is set to False after perfoming the copy.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1801152#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-10 11:36:29 UTC  ``` docker is not affected by this issue, even if it does support populating a volume using a container, as it checks whether the volume is empty before copying data from the container to the volume. Function populateVolumes() in create_unix.go of the docker code base is responsible for copying data from the container's rootfs into the volume. populateVolumes() calls CopyImagePathContent(), which in turn calls copyExistingContents() that checks whether the destination folder (the volume path) is empty or not.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1162432#c0)  Balázs Németh   2020-02-02 21:56:40 UTC  ``` Hello,  I have been using the Devel:Kubic repo in OpenSUSE Leap 15.1 for getting recent releases of podman.  Today I tried to use journald logging driver but it failed. It reports missing journald support. See error message below.  I found a similar issue regarding Ubuntu [2], which indicates it is a build time flag to have it enabled and downstream distros should build the binary that way. If I understood it correctly.  Steps of reproduction: 1) install podman from Devel:Kubic repo # podman pod create --name test # podman run -d --name example --expose 80 --expose 443 --pod test --log-driver journald --log-opt tag="nginx|{{.ImageName}}|podman" nginx:1.16 [conmon:e] Include journald in compilation path to log to systemd journal Error: write child: broken pipe # echo $? 126 # rpm -qa | egrep "podman|conmon" conmon-2.0.10-lp151.21.1.x86_64 podman-cni-config-1.7.0-lp151.4.1.noarch podman-1.7.0-lp151.4.1.x86_64  [1] [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel%3A/kubic/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/) [2] <https://github.com/containers/conmon/issues/67>  Let me know how can I help further.  Best regards, Balázs NÉMETH ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1162432#c1)  Fabian Vogt   2020-03-02 14:07:00 UTC  ``` Indeed, for that functionality conmon is missing BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libsystemd) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1162432#c2)  Balázs Németh   2020-04-03 09:33:13 UTC  ``` Hello,   Is there any chance of this getting into Tumbleweed / MicroOS? I would happily test it as soon as it hits the repos.  Kind regards, Balázs ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1162432#c3)  Ralf Haferkamp   2020-04-03 14:56:17 UTC  ``` I've just submitted <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/791223> and <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/791220> which should enable journald logging for.  They should appear devel:kubic it the near future. (You need update both, podman and conmon) ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1162432#c4)  Balázs Németh   2020-04-27 08:10:14 UTC  ``` I confirm the support is there in MicroOS. Thanks. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1162432#c5)  Ralf Haferkamp   2020-05-29 13:43:37 UTC  ``` This is fixed meanwhile ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1162432#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-09-24 10:13:53 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:2731-1: An update that solves one vulnerability, contains one feature and has 6 fixes is now available.
