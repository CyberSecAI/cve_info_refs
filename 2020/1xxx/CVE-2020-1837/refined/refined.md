- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device does not properly handle certain messages from a base station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of messages from a base station, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of signal service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker needs to craft a fake base station and send malicious messages to the target device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to create and operate a fake base station. The attack is adjacent (AV:A) and requires high effort (AC:H). No privileges are required.
