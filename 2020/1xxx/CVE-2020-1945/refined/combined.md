Subject: [CVE-2020-17521]: Apache Groovy Information Disclosure

CVE-2020-17521 Apache Groovy Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 2.0 to 2.4.4.
Apache Groovy versions 2.4.4 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13,
3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1.

Fixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2

Impact:

This vulnerability potentially impacts Unix-like systems, and very old
versions of Mac OSX and Windows. On such OS versions, Groovy may create
temporary directories within the OS temporary directory which is shared
between all users on affected systems. Groovy will create such directories
for internal use when producing Java Stubs (very low impact) or on behalf
of user code via two extension methods[4,5] for creating temporary
directories.
If Groovy user code uses either of these extension methods, and stores
executable code in the resulting temporary directory, then the risk is high,
since this can lead to local privilege escalation. If such Groovy code is
making
use of the temporary directory to store sensitive information, then the
risk is
medium, since such information could be exposed or modified.

When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important
questions to ask:

Is the Groovy code running on a machine with an impacted operating system?
Do other users have access to the machine running the Groovy code?
Does the Groovy code create temporary directories using Groovy's
createTempDir extension methods[4,5]?

If you answer no to any of these questions, you are not affected.
If you answered yes, does the Groovy code write or store executable code
in the temporary directory? If you answer yes, the risk is high, and can
lead to
local privilege escalation. Does the Groovy code write sensitive
information,
like API keys or passwords, into the temporary directory? If you answer yes,
the risk is medium, and information may be exposed or modified.

Description:

Groovy was making use of a method in the JDK which is now flagged as not
suitable for security-sensitive contexts. In addition, Groovy wasn't
checking
a flag related to successful creation of the temporary directory which leads
to a race condition whereby the vulnerability exists[1].

For the fixed versions, Groovy 2.5 and above is now using a newer JDK method
which creates a directory that is only readable by the user running the
Groovy
code. The same is true for the fixed Groovy 2.4 version except if running
on a pre-JDK7 version of the JDK in which case a fallback implementation is
used which now checks for successful creation of the temporary directory.
This eliminates the high-risk scenario involving the race condition whereby
executables or information could be modified, but still leaves the potential
for sensitive information leakage. Groovy 2.4/JDK 6 users are recommended
to use the `java.io.tmpdir` mitigation.

Mitigation:

Setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory
that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability
for all operating systems and all Groovy versions.

Users who cannot easily move to the fixed Groovy versions may wish to
consider using the JDK's Files#createTempDirectory method instead of the
Groovy extension methods.

# TemporaryFolder on unix-like systems does not limit access to created files

Low

[marcphilipp](/marcphilipp)
published
GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp
Oct 11, 2020

## Package

maven

junit:junit
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

4.7 - 4.13

## Patched versions

4.13.1

## Description

### Vulnerability

The JUnit4 test rule [TemporaryFolder](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.13/org/junit/rules/TemporaryFolder.html) contains a local information disclosure vulnerability.

Example of vulnerable code:

```
public static class HasTempFolder {
    @Rule
    public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();

    @Test
    public void testUsingTempFolder() throws IOException {
        folder.getRoot(); // Previous file permissions: `drwxr-xr-x`; After fix:`drwx------`
        File createdFile= folder.newFile("myfile.txt"); // unchanged/irrelevant file permissions
        File createdFolder= folder.newFolder("subfolder"); // unchanged/irrelevant file permissions
        // ...
    }
}
```
### Impact

On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system.

This vulnerability **does not** allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.

When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important questions to ask:

1. Do the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder?
   * If yes, this vulnerability impacts you, but only if you also answer 'yes' to question 2.
   * If no, this vulnerability does not impact you.
2. Do the JUnit tests ever execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.

   *This may apply in CI/CD environments but normally won't be 'yes' for personal developer machines.*
   * If yes, and you answered 'yes' to question 1, this vulnerability impacts you.
   * If no, this vulnerability does not impact you.

### Patches

Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using.

* Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1.
* Java 1.6 and lower users: **no patch is available, you must use the workaround below.**

### Workarounds

If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.

Subject: [CVE-2020-11979] Apache Ant insecure temporary file vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

CVE-2020-11979: Apache Ant insecure temporary file vulnerability

Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Ant 1.10.8

Description:

As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the
permissions of temporary files it created so that only the current user
was allowed to access them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the
temporary file and created a new one without said protection,
effectively nullifying the effort.

This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files into
the build process.

Mitigation:

The best mitigation against CVE-2020-11979 and CVE-2020-1945 still is to
make Ant use a directory that is only readable and writable by the
current user.

Ant users of versions 1.10.8 and 1.9.15 can use the Ant property
ant.tmpdir to point to such a directory, users of versions 1.1 to 1.9.14
and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 should set the java.io.tmpdir system property.

Ant 1.10.9 will also try to create a temporary directory only accessible
by the current user if neither of the properties above is set but may
fail to create one if the underlying filesystem doesn't allow it.

Explicitly setting up a directory to use and set the respective property
is the only mitigation that will work on every platform.

## Description

![@JLLeitschuh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1323708?u=477b44e744c9d63ec1386f1c728195936b42cbe7&v=4&size=48)[JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh)opened [on Sep 8, 2020](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011#issue-696211338)
# IMPORTANT NOTE

**Updating to Guava 30.0 does not fix this security vulnerability**. The method is merely deprecated. There currently exits no fix for this vulnerability.

[#4011 (comment)](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011#issuecomment-765672282)

---

Since the fix for this vulnerability is now disclosed by this commit ([fec0dbc](https://github.com/google/guava/commit/fec0dbc4634006a6162cfd4d0d09c962073ddf40)) and it was closed internally by google as 'Intended Functionality' I figure I'll disclose the vulnerability fully.

## Vulnerability

```
File guavaTempDir = com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir();
System.out.println("Guava Temp Dir: " + guavaTempDir.getName());
runLS(guavaTempDir.getParentFile(), guavaTempDir); // Prints the file permissions -> drwxr-xr-x
File child = new File(guavaTempDir, "guava-child.txt");
child.createNewFile();
runLS(guavaTempDir, child); // Prints the file permissions -> -rw-r--r--
```

On the flip side, when using `java.nio.file.Files`, this creates a directory with the correct file permissions.

```
Path temp = Files.createTempDirectory("random-directory");
System.out.println("Files Temp Dir: " + temp.getFileName());
runLS(temp.toFile().getParentFile(), temp.toFile()); // Prints the file permissions -> drwx------
Path child = temp.resolve("jdk-child.txt");
child.toFile().createNewFile();
runLS(temp.toFile(), child.toFile()); // Prints the file permissions -> -rw-r--r--
```
## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that, the file permissions on the file created by `com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir` allows an attacker running a malicious program co-resident on the same machine can steal secrets stored in this directory. This is because by default on unix-like operating systems the `/temp` directory is shared between all users, so if the correct file permissions aren't set by the directory/file creator, the file becomes readable by all other users on that system.

## Workaround

This vulnerability can be fixed by explicitly setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system property to a "safe" directory when starting the JVM.

## Resolution

The resolution by the Google team was the following:

> The team decided to document the behavior, as well as deprecate the method as other alternatives exist.

This completely makes sense to me, and I think is appropriate. The open question that exists in my mind is whether or not this issue warrants a CVE number issued.

Description :
Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to

points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the
build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks
allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant
can also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for

# Apache Ant: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202007-34**

Apache Ant uses various insecure temporary files possibly allowing
local code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/ant** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.10.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.10.8** |

### Background

Ant is a Java-based build tool similar to ‘make’ that uses XML
configuration files.

### Description

Apache Ant was found to be using multiple insecure temporary files which
may disclose sensitive information or execute code from an unsafe local
location.

### Impact

A local attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache Ant users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ant-1.10.8"

```

# CVE-2020-1945

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-1938.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-1946.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-1945 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1945)

#### Description

Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java system property java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : ant
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.10.8
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <https://ant.apache.org/>
Summary : Java build tool
Description :
Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to
drive processes described in build files as targets and extension
points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the
build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks
allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant
can also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for
instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to
pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets
and tasks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1171696#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-05-14 15:45:08 UTC  ``` through oss  CVE-2020-1945: Apache Ant insecure temporary file vulnerability  Severity: Medium  Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation  Versions Affected: Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7  Description:  Apache Ant uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java system property java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.  Mitigation:  Ant users of versions 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 should set the java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a directory only readable and writable by the current user prior to running Ant.  Users of versions 1.9.15 and 1.10.8 can use the Ant property ant.tmpfile instead. Users of Ant 1.10.8 can rely on Ant protecting the temporary files if the underlying filesystem allows it, but we still recommend using a private temporary directory instead.

| [Description](#c0)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-05-14 18:52:11 UTC  ``` Description: "Apache Ant uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java system property java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process."  Mitigation: "Ant users of versions 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 should set the java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a directory only readable and writable by the current user prior to running Ant.  Users of versions 1.9.15 and 1.10.8 can use the Ant property ant.tmpfile instead. Users of Ant 1.10.8 can rely on Ant protecting the temporary files if the underlying filesystem allows it, but we still recommend using a private temporary directory instead." ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-05-14 18:52:54 UTC  ``` @maintainer(s), a bump to 1.10.8 may be easiest given it's in the same series? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Miroslav Šulc   gentoo-dev  2020-07-05 11:25:50 UTC  ``` i just did the bump. if it is not urgent, i'd wait at least few days before stabilization is requested to catch any issues. i already prepared the list of the packages that will have to be stabilized so then we can just add the archs and stabilization keyword. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-07-18 20:49:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Miroslav Šulc from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=723086#c2)) > i just did the bump. if it is not urgent, i'd wait at least few days before > stabilization is requested to catch any issues. i already prepared the list > of the packages that will have to be stabilized so then we can just add the > archs and stabilization keyword.
