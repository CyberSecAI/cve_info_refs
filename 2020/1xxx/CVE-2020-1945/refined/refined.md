  "CVE-2020-1945": {
    "description": "Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java system property java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Apache Ant's use of the system's default temporary directory, which is often shared between users, and a failure to set appropriate file permissions. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks further exacerbate the issue by copying files from the temporary directory back into the build tree, without proper checks, potentially allowing for the injection of malicious code.",

        "Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions",
        "Information disclosure due to shared temporary directory permissions",
        "Code injection vulnerability through modified source files"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could read sensitive information, inject modified source files, or achieve local privilege escalation by exploiting the insecure temporary file creation.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the machine running Apache Ant",
         "Exploiting insecure temporary files in a shared temporary directory",

Ant users of versions 1.10.8 and 1.9.15 can use the Ant property ant.tmpdir to point to such a directory, users of versions 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 should set the java.io.tmpdir system property."
