Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the modification of `/etc/passwd` file permissions by the `openshift-service-mesh/kiali-rhel7-operator` container, making it writable by users other than root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is that the `/etc/passwd` file is made modifiable by non-root users within the container.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with access to the running container can modify the `/etc/passwd` file. This allows them to add a new user with root privileges, thus escalating their privileges within the container and potentially the host system depending on the container configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Container:** The primary attack vector is an attacker gaining access to the running `openshift-service-mesh/kiali-rhel7-operator` container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Container Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of access to the vulnerable container.
- **Modification of /etc/passwd:**  The attacker needs to be able to modify the /etc/passwd file by adding a user with root privileges.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is specific to the `openshift-service-mesh/kiali-rhel7-operator` container.
- It was noted that the vulnerability is not exploitable by default in unprivileged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform due to seccomp policy blocking SETUID and SETGID system calls.
- The issue was addressed in `openshift-istio-kiali-rhel7-operator-container 1.12.12-2`.
- The issue was fixed in Openshift Service Mesh 1.1 via RHSA-2020:2369.
