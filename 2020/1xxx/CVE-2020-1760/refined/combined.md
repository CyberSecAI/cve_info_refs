preform an HTTP header injection attack. ([CVE-2020-10753](/security/CVE-2020-10753))

Lei Cao discovered that Ceph incorrectly handled certain POST requests with

invalid tagging XML. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause Ceph to crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2020-12059](/security/CVE-2020-12059))

Robin H. Johnson discovered that Ceph incorrectly handled certain S3

requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

XSS attack. ([CVE-2020-1760](/security/CVE-2020-1760))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1812962#c0)  Marian Rehak    2020-03-12 15:17:12 UTC  ``` If the attacker knows the path to a publicly readable object on any RGW cluster and the object is at least large enough to cover the attack body there it's possible to run an XSS on any object.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1812962#c4)  Hardik Vyas    2020-03-16 14:30:39 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  * Mitigation provided by DigitalOcean:  Mitigation relies on the HAProxy load-balancers in front of RGW, and uses HAProxy ACLs combined with in-house Lua embedded in HAProxy.  1. Detect usage of the query-parameters without any signature (either pre-signed or header), and return S3-formatted error. 2. Validate the content in the query-parameters, return S3-formatted error.

Package        : ceph
Version        : 10.2.11-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-14662 CVE-2018-16846 CVE-2020-1760 CVE-2020-10753
                 CVE-2021-3524
Debian Bug     : 921948 921947 956142 975300 988889

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ceph, a distributed storage
and file system.

CVE-2018-14662

     Authenticated ceph users with read only permissions could steal dm-crypt
     encryption keys used in ceph disk encryption.

CVE-2018-16846

     Authenticated ceph RGW users can cause a denial of service against OMAPs
     holding bucket indices.

CVE-2020-10753

     A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object
     Gateway).
     The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS
     ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the
     CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when
     the CORS request is made.

CVE-2020-1760

     A flaw was found in the Ceph Object Gateway, where it supports request
     sent by an anonymous user in Amazon S3. This flaw could lead to potential
     XSS attacks due to the lack of proper neutralization of untrusted input.

CVE-2021-3524

     A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway)
     The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS
     ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the
     CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when
     the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-
     10753 did not account for the use of \r as a header separator, thus a new
     flaw has been created.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
10.2.11-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ceph packages.

For the detailed security status of ceph please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ceph>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: CVE-2020-1760 ceph: header-splitting in RGW GetObject has a possible XSS

Hello,

A flaw was found in the Ceph Object Gateway, where it supports
unauthenticated requests sent by an anonymous
user in Amazon S3. This flaw could lead to potential XSS attacks due to the
lack of proper neutralization of
untrusted input. If the attacker knows the path to a publicly readable
object on any RGW cluster and the object
is at least large enough to cover the attack body then it's possible to run
an XSS on any object.

This flaw was introduced with commit
f4a0b2d9260a4523745875e3977a8a1ef9dc5e2e(Oct 9, 2012) and affects
all the way up to master. Red Hat has assigned CVE-2020-1760 for this issue.

Upstream Patches:

<https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ci/commit/18eb4d918b27d362312c29a3bbd57a421897c0a5>
<https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ci/commit/1bf14094fec34770d2cc74317f4238ccb2dfef98>

Credit:

- Initial report to DigitalOcean by William Bowling twitter handle
@wcbowling
- Further evaluation and extension to Robin H. Johnson @robbat2,

PS: The patches are currently available from ceph.git clone(ceph-ci) and
will be pushed to active releases soon.

Debian Bug     : 1053690

Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in Ceph, a massively scalable,
open-source, distributed storage system that runs on commodity hardware
and delivers object, block and file system storage.

CVE-2019-10222

    A Denial of service was fixed: An unauthenticated attacker could crash
    the Ceph RGW server by sending valid HTTP headers and terminating the
    connection, resulting in a remote denial of service for Ceph RGW clients.

CVE-2020-1700

    A Denial of Service was fixed: A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW
    Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnects. An authenticated attacker
    can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a
    permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to
    a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually
    leading to the exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate
    users from connecting to the system.

CVE-2020-1760

    A XSS attack was fixed: A flaw was found in the Ceph Object Gateway,
    where it supports request sent by an anonymous user in Amazon S3.
    This flaw could lead to potential XSS attacks due to the lack
    of proper neutralization of untrusted input.

CVE-2020-10753

    A Header Injection attack was fixed: It was possible to
    inject HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag in an Amazon S3 bucket. The
    newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file
    generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is
    made.

CVE-2020-12059

    A Denial of Service was fixed: A POST request with an invalid tagging
    XML could crash the RGW process by triggering a NULL pointer exception.

CVE-2020-25678

    An Information Disclosure was fixed: ceph stores mgr module passwords
    in clear text. This can be found by searching the mgr logs for grafana and
    dashboard, with passwords visible.

CVE-2020-27781

    A Privilege Escalation was fixed: User credentials could be manipulated
    and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack Manila, resulting in
    potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request
    access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users.
    The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of
    the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables the
    attacker to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be
    done to even "admin" users, compromising the ceph administrator.

CVE-2021-3524

    Similar to CVE-2020-10753, a Header Injection attack was fixed:
    It was possible to inject HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader
    tag in an Amazon S3 bucket

CVE-2021-3531

    A Denial of Service was fixed: When processing a GET Request in Ceph
    Storage RGW for a swift URL that ends with two slashes it could cause the
    rgw to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3979

    A Loss of Confidentiality was fixed: A key length flaw was found in
    Ceph Storage. An attacker could exploit the fact that the key length is
    incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key,
    which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and
    integrity on encrypted disks.

CVE-2021-20288

    A Potential Privilege Escalation was fixed: When handling
    CEPHX_GET_PRINCIPAL_SESSION_KEY requests, ignore CEPH_ENTITY_TYPE_AUTH in
    CephXServiceTicketRequest::keys.

CVE-2023-43040

    A flaw was found in Ceph RGW. An unprivileged
    user can write to any bucket(s) accessible by a given key
    if a POST's form-data contains a key called 'bucket'
    with a value matching the name of the bucket used to sign
    the request. The result of this is that a user could actually
    upload to any bucket accessible by the specified access key
    as long as the bucket in the POST policy matches the bucket
    in said POST form part.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
12.2.11+dfsg1-2.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ceph packages.
