Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-1760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) improperly handles requests from anonymous users when using Amazon S3. Specifically, it allows manipulation of response headers via query parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Header Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response by using specially crafted query parameters (e.g. response-content-type, response-cache-control, etc.) in an S3 GetObject request.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The RGW does not properly sanitize or neutralize untrusted input from these query parameters, making it susceptible to header splitting.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability exists because the RGW allows anonymous users to manipulate these headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious HTTP headers, an attacker can perform an XSS attack. This could allow them to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser when they access a manipulated object.
- **Potential for other attacks:** While the primary focus is XSS, the ability to inject headers could potentially be used for other malicious purposes depending on the context (e.g. cache poisoning).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attacker sends a specially crafted GET request to the Ceph RGW server.
- **S3 API:** The attacker leverages the Amazon S3 API's GetObject functionality.
- **Query Parameters:** The attacker uses query parameters within the GetObject request to manipulate response headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Public Object Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to a publicly readable object on the RGW cluster.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability because anonymous access to the RGW is sufficient.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target RGW.
- **Object Size:** The object must be large enough to include the malicious attack payload.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in commit f4a0b2d9260a4523745875e3977a8a1ef9dc5e2e (October 9, 2012) and affected all versions up to the master branch.
- The fix involves rejecting unauthenticated requests that try to manipulate response headers and correctly handling of the "response-content-type" parameter.
- Patches were applied in Ceph versions 15.2.1, 14.2.9 and 13.2.9.

This content provides more details than the standard CVE description, particularly by specifying the attack vector through S3 GetObject and query parameters, also the lack of authentication required for exploitation and the exact vulnerability type which is header splitting leading to XSS.
