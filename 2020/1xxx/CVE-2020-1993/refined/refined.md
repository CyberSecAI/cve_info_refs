Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GlobalProtect Portal feature in PAN-OS does not set a new session identifier after a successful user login. This allows an attacker to potentially perform a session fixation attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session fixation vulnerability: The application fails to generate a new session ID upon successful authentication, making the session susceptible to hijacking.
- Improper session management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If an attacker can control a user's session ID, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's session and resources.
- Confidentiality Impact: LOW. An attacker might be able to access sensitive information of the user.
- Integrity Impact: LOW. An attacker might be able to modify some resources on behalf of the user.
- Availability Impact: NONE. This vulnerability does not lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- An attacker needs to be able to control a user's session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a way to control the session ID of the targeted user. This could be achieved through various means such as social engineering, malicious links, or network-based attacks.
- The attacker requires low privileges and user interaction is required.
