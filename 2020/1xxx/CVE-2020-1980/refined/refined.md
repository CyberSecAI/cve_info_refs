Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1980

**Root Cause:** A shell command injection vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS CLI. This allows an authenticated local user to execute arbitrary shell commands by escaping the restricted shell environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, specifically within the PAN-OS CLI. This allows for command injection.
*  **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The vulnerability indicates a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the CLI, which allows for the injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user with low privileges can use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges to that of the system, which would grant them full control of the device.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:**  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Integrity Impact:**  The attacker could modify system configurations, data, or other system elements.
*   **Availability Impact:** The attacker could disrupt services, cause system instability, or render the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning that the attacker must have local access to the PAN-OS device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to access the PAN-OS CLI locally.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the PAN-OS system.
*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a low-privileged authenticated user.

**Affected Versions:**
*   PAN-OS 8.1 versions prior to 8.1.13

**Unaffected Versions:**
*   PAN-OS 7.1, 9.0 and later versions

**Mitigation:**
* Upgrade to PAN-OS 8.1.13 or later
* Secure the management interface by following best practices

**CWE:** CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'))
