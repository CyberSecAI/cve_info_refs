- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device does not sufficiently validate certain credentials of a user's face, allowing an attacker to craft a credential that bypasses authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication. The device fails to properly validate face recognition credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could bypass facial recognition authentication and gain unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must gain physical access to the device and be able to craft a malicious face credential.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Physical access to the device is required and the ability to create a credential that mimics the user's face.
