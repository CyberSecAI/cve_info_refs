Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-1747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `FullLoader` class of the PyYAML library. This loader, introduced in version 5.1, is used by default with `yaml.load()` when no loader is specified, or when `yaml.full_load()` is used directly.
*   The `FullLoader` allows for the deserialization of Python objects from YAML, including the creation of new objects through the `python/object/new` constructor.
*   An attacker can craft malicious YAML that, when parsed by `FullLoader`, abuses the `python/object/new` constructor to execute arbitrary code by setting a malicious state to the deserialized object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code by manipulating the state of deserialized objects through the `python/object/new` constructor with `FullLoader`.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The library doesn't properly sanitize input, leading to the unsafe deserialization of user-provided YAML data.
*   **Blacklist Bypass**: The fix for this issue was initially implemented as a blacklist, which could be bypassed by carefully nesting objects.
*   **Use of Unsafe Loader:** Using `FullLoader` or `yaml.load` without specifying a safer loader can be insecure, especially with untrusted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the system where the vulnerable PyYAML library is used.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This arbitrary code execution can lead to a full compromise of the affected system, potentially allowing the attacker to steal data, modify the system, or disrupt its operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious YAML Input:** The primary attack vector is through the parsing of maliciously crafted YAML files.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely if the application processes untrusted YAML input from a network source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control YAML Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious YAML document to an application using the vulnerable library.
*   **No authentication**: The initial exploit of the vulnerability can be performed without authentication.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to a vulnerable application parsing the malicious YAML input.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to use `yaml.safe_load` or the `SafeLoader` when parsing untrusted YAML input. These safe loaders do not allow the deserialization of arbitrary Python objects, preventing the vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in PyYAML versions 5.3.1 and 5.4.1, with 5.3.1 addressing the initial report and 5.4.1 addressing bypasses of the initial blacklist fix. The fix was to blacklist methods and properties that can be used in an exploit chain, and later to create a safer `SafeLoader` and move dangerous constructors to `UnsafeLoader`.
*  **CVSS Score**: While the CVSS score is 9.8, the actual impact is described as moderate because the library already recommends using safe loader when parsing untrusted input.
*   **Affected Applications**: Applications using `yaml.load` or `yaml.full_load` with untrusted input are vulnerable. Some applications using PyYAML with `SafeLoader` are not affected.
*   **OpenStack:** Openstack was reported as not affected because the packaged RHOSP version (PyYAML-3.10-11.el7) does not have the `FullLoader` code.
*   **Red Hat Quay:** Some Red Hat Quay versions were initially reported as using the vulnerable function. Later, it was found that Red Hat Quay, from version 3.4, uses the safe_load function, thus they are not affected by this issue.
*   **Ansible Tower:** Ansible Tower and Ansible Engine are not affected as they use a `SafeLoader` method.
