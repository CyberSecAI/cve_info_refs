| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 08:26:35 UTC  ``` An arbitrary code execution was discovered in PyYAML when YAML files are parsed by FullLoader. This loader is used by default by yaml.load() when no loader is specified or when yaml.full_load() is used. Applications that use PyYAML to parse untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, by abusing the python/object/new constructor.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 08:26:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Riccardo Schirone (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 10:39:25 UTC  ``` FullLoader, which is the class where this vulnerability lies, was introduced in upstream version 5.1.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 10:39:46 UTC  ``` Even though the CVSS is 9.8/CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, the Impact of this flaw is set to Medium as `yaml.load`/`yaml.full_load` should not be used on untrusted input. When untrusted input needs to be parsed, `SafeLoader` or `yaml.safe_load` must be used instead. This has been documented for a very long time in PyYAML.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 10:43:27 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Use `yaml.safe_load` or the SafeLoader loader when you parse untrusted input.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c7)  Jason Shepherd    2020-02-27 00:50:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Quay 3.2 uses the vulnerable load function, but only to parse the Nginx configuration file, which only contains trusted data.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-02 08:49:58 UTC  ``` Upstream PR: <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/386>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c13)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-02 09:36:07 UTC  ``` Created PyYAML tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1809011](show_bug.cgi?id=1809011 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1747 PyYAML: arbitrary command execution through python/object/new when FullLoader is used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c17)  Summer Long    2020-03-05 03:51:49 UTC  ``` OpenStack: set to 'notaffected' because the packaged RHOSP version (PyYAML-3.10-11.el7) doesn't have the FullLoader code (lib/yaml/loader.py and constructor.py).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c18)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-24 09:05:43 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/commit/5080ba513377b6355a0502104846ee804656f1e0>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c19)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-04 02:24:31 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

So Ansible Tower and Ansible Engine are not affected.  Red Hat Quay, from version 3.4 uses the safe_load function which is not affected by this issue. See [1].  Even though the CVSSv3 for this flaw is 9.8, the Impact has been set to Moderate because PyYAML provides a specific method to deal with untrusted input, which is `yaml.safe_load`. `yaml.safe_load` or the SafeLoader loader should be used whenever the input YAML can be modified by a malicious user.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1165439#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-03-02 12:40:25 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-1747  An arbitrary code execution was discovered in PyYAML when YAML files are parsed by FullLoader. This loader is used by default by yaml.load() when no loader is specified or when yaml.full_load() is used. Applications that use PyYAML to parse untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, by abusing the python/object/new constructor.

### @ret2libc **[ret2libc](/ret2libc)** commented [Mar 2, 2020](#issue-573811286)

In FullLoader python/object/new constructor, implemented by

construct\_python\_object\_apply, has support for setting the state of a

deserialized instance through the set\_python\_instance\_state method.

After setting the state, some operations are performed on the instance

to complete its initialization, however it is possible for an attacker

to set the instance' state in such a way that arbitrary code is executed

by the FullLoader.

This patch tries to block such attacks in FullLoader by preventing

set\_python\_instance\_state from setting arbitrary properties. It

implements a blacklist that includes `extend` method (called by

construct\_python\_object\_apply) and all special methods (e.g. `__set__`,

`__setitem__`, etc.).

Users who need special attributes being set in the state of a

deserialized object can still do it through the UnsafeLoader, which

however should not be used on untrusted input. Additionally, they can

subclass FullLoader and redefine `state_blacklist_regexp` to include the

additional attributes they need, passing the subclassed loader to

yaml.load.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Address the "private" method concern, and I think we'll be good. Cheers.

I think this is ready to make a beta release. [@perlpunk](https://github.com/perlpunk) please proceed. (assuming you want to and have time, else let me know...)

[@ret2libc](https://github.com/ret2libc) hats off to your professional reporting of this and coming up with a solution that serves both YAML and Python well. Let me know if I can return the favor. 👍

`[Prevents arbitrary code execution during python/object/new constructor (](/yaml/pyyaml/commit/0afa8ac5e13ffef72120161ae766746ae77096d3 "Prevents arbitrary code execution during python/object/new constructor (#386)

* Prevents arbitrary code execution during python/object/new constructor

In FullLoader python/object/new constructor, implemented by
construct_python_object_apply, has support for setting the state of a
deserialized instance through the set_python_instance_state method.
After setting the state, some operations are performed on the instance
to complete its initialization, however it is possible for an attacker
to set the instance' state in such a way that arbitrary code is executed
by the FullLoader.

This patch tries to block such attacks in FullLoader by preventing
set_python_instance_state from setting arbitrary properties. It
implements a blacklist that includes `extend` method (called by
construct_python_object_apply) and all special methods (e.g. __set__,
__setitem__, etc.).

Users who need special attributes being set in the state of a
deserialized object can still do it through the UnsafeLoader, which
however should not be used on untrusted input. Additionally, they can
subclass FullLoader and redefine `get_state_keys_blacklist()` to
extend/replace the list of blacklisted keys, passing the subclassed
loader to yaml.load.

* Make sure python/object/new constructor does not set some properties

* Add test to show how to subclass FullLoader with new blacklist")`

| Hello, we recently download the 5.3.1 PyYAML-5.3.1-cp36-cp36m-win\_amd64.whl and run the blackduck scan.  The tool still finds [CVE-2020-1747](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6757-jp84-gxfx "CVE-2020-1747") issue in \_yaml.cp36-win\_amd64.pyd .  May i know if that's fixed in the pyd file as well? thank you! |

Original commit: 0afa8ac5e13ffef72120161ae766746ae77096d3

* Prevents arbitrary code execution during python/object/new constructor

In FullLoader python/object/new constructor, implemented by
construct_python_object_apply, has support for setting the state of a
deserialized instance through the set_python_instance_state method.
After setting the state, some operations are performed on the instance
to complete its initialization, however it is possible for an attacker
to set the instance' state in such a way that arbitrary code is executed
by the FullLoader.

This patch tries to block such attacks in FullLoader by preventing

* Prevents arbitrary code execution during python/object/new constructor

In FullLoader python/object/new constructor, implemented by
construct_python_object_apply, has support for setting the state of a
deserialized instance through the set_python_instance_state method.
After setting the state, some operations are performed on the instance
to complete its initialization, however it is possible for an attacker
to set the instance' state in such a way that arbitrary code is executed
by the FullLoader.

This patch tries to block such attacks in FullLoader by preventing
set_python_instance_state from setting arbitrary properties. It
implements a blacklist that includes `extend` method (called by
construct_python_object_apply) and all special methods (e.g. __set__,
__setitem__, etc.).

Users who need special attributes being set in the state of a
deserialized object can still do it through the UnsafeLoader, which

# CVE-2020-1747

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-1746.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-1749.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-1747 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1747)

#### Description

A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.3.1, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full\_load method or with the FullLoader loader. Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor.

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-6757-jp84-gxfx/dependabot)

## Package

pip

pyyaml
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 5.1b7, < 5.3.1

## Patched versions

5.3.1

## Description

A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.3.1, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full\_load method or with the FullLoader loader. Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 08:26:35 UTC  ``` An arbitrary code execution was discovered in PyYAML when YAML files are parsed by FullLoader. This loader is used by default by yaml.load() when no loader is specified or when yaml.full_load() is used. Applications that use PyYAML to parse untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, by abusing the python/object/new constructor.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 08:26:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Riccardo Schirone (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 10:39:25 UTC  ``` FullLoader, which is the class where this vulnerability lies, was introduced in upstream version 5.1.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 10:39:46 UTC  ``` Even though the CVSS is 9.8/CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, the Impact of this flaw is set to Medium as `yaml.load`/`yaml.full_load` should not be used on untrusted input. When untrusted input needs to be parsed, `SafeLoader` or `yaml.safe_load` must be used instead. This has been documented for a very long time in PyYAML.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-26 10:43:27 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Use `yaml.safe_load` or the SafeLoader loader when you parse untrusted input.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c7)  Jason Shepherd    2020-02-27 00:50:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Quay 3.2 uses the vulnerable load function, but only to parse the Nginx configuration file, which only contains trusted data.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-02 08:49:58 UTC  ``` Upstream PR: <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/386>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c13)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-02 09:36:07 UTC  ``` Created PyYAML tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1809011](show_bug.cgi?id=1809011 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1747 PyYAML: arbitrary command execution through python/object/new when FullLoader is used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c17)  Summer Long    2020-03-05 03:51:49 UTC  ``` OpenStack: set to 'notaffected' because the packaged RHOSP version (PyYAML-3.10-11.el7) doesn't have the FullLoader code (lib/yaml/loader.py and constructor.py).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c18)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-24 09:05:43 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/commit/5080ba513377b6355a0502104846ee804656f1e0>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1807367#c19)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-04 02:24:31 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
