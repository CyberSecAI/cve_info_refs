Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-1823:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol implementation of certain Huawei products. Specifically, a decoding function incorrectly processes incoming data packets, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is the out-of-bounds read when processing COPS data packets. This occurs in the specific decoding functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this out-of-bounds read vulnerability can lead to a disruption of services on the affected Huawei device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to gain access to the network where the vulnerable device is located to send crafted COPS data packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device to send malicious COPS packets. No other specific capabilities are mentioned in this advisory.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions multiple CVEs (CVE-2020-1818, CVE-2020-1819, CVE-2020-1820, CVE-2020-1821, CVE-2020-1822, CVE-2020-1823, and CVE-2020-1824) related to similar out-of-bounds read issues in the COPS implementation.
*   The affected products include IPS modules, NGFW modules, NIP6300, NIP6600, NIP6800, Secospace USG6300, Secospace USG6500, Secospace USG6600, and USG6000V.
*   Huawei has released software updates to address the vulnerabilities.
