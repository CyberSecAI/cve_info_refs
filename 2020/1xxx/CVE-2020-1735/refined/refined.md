{
  "CVE-2020-1735": {
    "description": "The `fetch` module takes the `source` result from the `slurp` module, which came from the remote host. We don't really validate this path and it could have been manipulated by the remote host in a malicious way such that we end up a path similar to `/tmp/result_fetch/ansible1/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../home/<user>/.profile` for the source. This allows an attacker to place a file the contents of which they control.",
    "root_cause": "Path traversal vulnerability in the fetch module due to insufficient validation of the source path provided by the remote host.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Path traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can place a file with controlled content at an arbitrary location on the Ansible controller host.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker manipulates the source path returned by the slurp module on the remote host, which is then used by the fetch module on the Ansible controller.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have control over the remote host where the slurp module is executed. The attacker can manipulate the source file path to include path traversal sequences.",
