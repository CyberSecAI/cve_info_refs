Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user downloads PGP or S/MIME keys/certificates, both the private and public keys are exported with the same filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the potential for users to unintentionally mix up their private and public keys. This can lead to a user mistakenly sending their private key to a third-party, compromising their private key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Private Key:**  The most significant impact is the potential disclosure of a user's private key, which could allow an attacker to impersonate the user or decrypt their sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker could rely on a user's unawareness or mistake to send the private key to a third party instead of the intended public key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker does not require any specific access to OTRS systems or accounts. An attacker's capability is derived from social engineering and a user mistakenly mixing private and public keys due to the same filenames.
* The attacker does not need to be in the OTRS system.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability affects OTRS versions 7.0.x, 6.0.x, and 5.0.x.
* Fixed versions are OTRS 7.0.17 and OTRS 6.0.28.
* The vulnerability is also tracked as OSA-2020-11
