Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1919:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `substr_compare()` function of HHVM. Specifically, the issue arises due to incorrect calculation of the comparison length (`cmp_len`), leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds heap read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read on the heap. This occurs when `substr_compare` attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary data from the heap memory, leading to information disclosure. This could include sensitive information if present in the heap.
- **Potential Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly mentioned, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes lead to crashes, potentially causing a DoS. However, this is less clear in the context of the provided information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `substr_compare` function.
- An attacker needs to supply crafted inputs to this function, specifically parameters related to string offsets and lengths, to cause the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to call the `substr_compare` function with malicious arguments. This implies the attacker needs to interact with the HHVM environment where this function is exposed. The precise means of interaction would depend on how HHVM is used (e.g., web application, etc).
-  The attacker needs to be able to control string offsets and lengths passed to `substr_compare`

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided commit diff shows changes to `hphp/runtime/ext/string/ext_string.cpp` that address the vulnerability in `substr_compare`.
-   The blog post on hhvm.com explicitly mentions CVE-2020-1919 as an out-of-bounds heap read in `substr_compare()`

The provided diff also contains unrelated changes:
- Changes to `hphp/runtime/base/mem-file.cpp` correct a seek operation logic
- Changes to `hphp/runtime/base/preg.cpp` add a `static_assert` for memory allocation
- Several files have changes regarding the usage of `int` and `int64_t` for length/size arguments which are not related to the mentioned CVE.
-   Fixes in multiple files address potential buffer overflows in string manipulation (strncpy) and other functions such as `mcrypt_generic_init`, `openssl`, `sockets`, `fwrite`, `serialize_impl`, `exif_scan_thumbnail`
