{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs when OTRS uses multiple backends for user authentication with LDAP, allowing agents to log in even if their account is marked as invalid.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Bypassing user account validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit would allow an agent with an invalid account to log in and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system's resources, possibly leading to information disclosure or modification.",
  "Attack vectors": "Adjacent network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have a valid account, or have compromised a valid account, and be present on the same network as the OTRS application, also the attacker must be logged in."
