- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization in ADB mode. The system does not properly restrict certain operations when the device is in ADB mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization, lack of restrictions on certain operations in ADB mode.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A user with limited access can bypass the digital balance function limit.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must gain limited user access to the phone and use ADB mode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device or needs to compromise an existing limited user account on the device. They must also have the ability to use ADB mode on the device.
