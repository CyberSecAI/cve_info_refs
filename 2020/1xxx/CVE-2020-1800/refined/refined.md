- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control to a function interface. The software does not properly restrict access to a function interface from an unauthorized actor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, allowing unauthorized operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform certain unauthenticated operations on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to develop a malicious application and convince a user to install it. The attacker does not require network access, as the vulnerability is triggered by the installed application.
