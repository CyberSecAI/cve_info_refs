Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-1730:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way `libssh` handles AES-CTR (and potentially DES) ciphers. Specifically, a crash can occur if a connection is closed before these ciphers are fully initialized. The root cause is improper cleanup of partially initialized ciphers.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Cipher Handling:** The library fails to properly handle the lifecycle of AES-CTR and DES ciphers, leading to a crash during cleanup when a connection is terminated prematurely.
*   **Denial of Service:** This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a crash in the `libssh` library. This could impact both the server and client side of an SSH connection. In a server context, this would interrupt service to other users.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted network traffic, specifically the closing of a connection before ciphers are fully initialized. This indicates the attack can originate from a remote source.
*  **Malicious Client or Server:** Either a malicious client or a malicious server can cause the crash of the other counterpart.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system.
*   **SSH Connection Establishment:** The attacker needs to establish a connection using the `libssh` library or be on the other side of such a connection.
*   **Cipher Negotiation:** It might be required to initiate the connection using a vulnerable cipher (AES-CTR or DES).

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   **Affected Versions:** `libssh` versions prior to 0.8.9 and 0.9.4 are affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Disabling AES-CTR (and potentially DES) ciphers can help mitigate this issue. Using a prefork model in the server application (where each session runs in its own process) is also proposed as a mitigation but would still crash the attacking client connection.
*  **Specific libraries:** The issue is triggered during cleanup in `src/libcrypto.c`
*   **Fedora Impact:** Fedora updates were released for Fedora 31 and 32 to address this CVE.
*   **Ubuntu Impact:** Ubuntu 19.10 and 18.04 ESM were affected and patched with updated `libssh` packages.
*  **NetApp Impact**: Multiple NetApp products that incorporate libssh are vulnerable and patches were released for affected products.
