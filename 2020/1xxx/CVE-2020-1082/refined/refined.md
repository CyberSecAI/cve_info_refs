{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a local file inclusion vulnerability in the 'modname' parameter of the '/Modules.php' page within OS4Ed openSIS 7.3. The application improperly sanitizes user input, allowing for directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to include arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, and if an attacker can control the content of an included file, it can lead to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the '/Modules.php' endpoint, manipulating the 'modname' parameter with directory traversal sequences.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. Authentication might be required for some components of the system, but the LFI vulnerability itself doesn't require authentication based on the provided information."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "vulnerable_code": "The vulnerable code is located in `Modules.php` at line 989:\n`include('modules/' . $modname);`\n\nThe application does have checks for the beginning of `modname`, but it does not fully prevent path traversal attempts.",
    "exploit_example": "The provided example demonstrates retrieving `/etc/passwd`:\n\n```\nPOST /opensis/Modules.php?modname=grades%2fReportCards.php..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd&modfunc=&search_modfunc=list&next_modname=grades/ReportCards.php HTTP/1.1\n```",
    "remote_code_execution": "Remote code execution is possible if an attacker can write PHP code to a file on the server (e.g., through access logs) and then include that file using this LFI vulnerability."
  },
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-1082"
