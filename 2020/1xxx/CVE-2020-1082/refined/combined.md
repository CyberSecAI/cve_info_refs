# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1082

## OS4Ed openSIS Modules.php remote code execution vulnerability

##### August 31, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-6142

### Summary

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Modules.php functionality of OS4Ed openSIS 7.3. A specially crafted HTTP request can cause local file inclusion. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

OS4Ed openSIS 7.3

### Product URLs

<https://opensis.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

### Details

openSIS is a student information system and school management system. It is available in commercial and open-source versions. It allows schools to create schedules and track attendance, grades and transcripts.

A local file inclusion vulnerability was discovered in the ‘modname’ parameter in the ‘/Modules.php’ page of OpenSIS 7.3. This vulnerability can be exploited to include arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences and subsequently disclose contents of arbitrary files or even execute remote PHP code.

The following request is a Proof-of-Concept for retrieving /etc/passwd file form remote system.

```
POST /opensis/Modules.php?modname=grades%2fReportCards.php..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd&modfunc=&search_modfunc=list&next_modname=grades/ReportCards.php HTTP/1.1

```

Below is the vulnerable code in `Modules.php` where specific a query with `modname` parameter will lead to local file inclusion at line 989:

```
 980         $allowed = true;
 981     if (substr(optional_param('modname', '', PARAM_NOTAGS), 0, 14) == 'miscellaneous/' || substr(optional_param('modname', '', PARAM_NOTAGS), 0, 7) == 'grades/')
 982         $allowed = true;
 983     if (optional_param('modname', '', PARAM_NOTAGS) == 'messaging/AddMember.php')
 984         $allowed = true;
 985     if ($allowed || $_SESSION['take_mssn_attn']) {
 986
 987         if (Preferences('SEARCH') != 'Y' && substr(clean_param($modname, PARAM_NOTAGS), 0, 6) != 'users/')
 988             $_REQUEST['search_modfunc'] = 'list';
 989         include('modules/' . $modname);
 990     }

```

The request can be done either by including grades or miscellaneous as directory name for the request.

If an attacker can write PHP code somewhere in a file on the file system they can also cause remote code execution.
An example would be to connect to the HTTP server and enter PHP code as a request and subsequently including the access.log file.
