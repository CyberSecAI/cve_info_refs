{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient boundary checks in `SimpleParser::handleBackslash` during JSON decoding.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read in `SimpleParser::handleBackslash` due to insufficient checks when handling backslash escape sequences.",
     "The code reads 4 characters assuming they are part of the escape sequence without checking if the end of the string has been reached which leads to a read out of bounds."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DOS) due to out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted JSON input with specific backslash escape sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable HHVM instance with a crafted JSON input."
