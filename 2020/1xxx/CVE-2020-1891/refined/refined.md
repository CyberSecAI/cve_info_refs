- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A user-controlled parameter used during video calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write on 32-bit devices.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Could lead to memory corruption, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs during video calls, specifically through the user-controlled parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to initiate a video call and control a specific parameter used in the call setup. The target must be using a 32-bit device.
