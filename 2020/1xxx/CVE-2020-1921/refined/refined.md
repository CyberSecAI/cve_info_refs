  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `crypt()` function in HHVM has a 1-byte out-of-bounds write due to a buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write (1 byte)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a crash or allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `crypt()` function with a specially crafted input string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `crypt()` function."
