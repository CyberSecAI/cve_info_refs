{
  "CVE-2020-1770": {
    "Description": "Support bundle generated files could contain sensitive information that might be unwanted to be disclosed.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The support bundle generated by the application could inadvertently include sensitive data, such as user credentials or other confidential information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of sensitive data within the support bundle, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to the support bundle could extract sensitive information.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to obtain a copy of the support bundle. This could happen if they have administrative access to the system, intercept the bundle during transfer, or obtain it through other means."
  },
 "CVE-2020-1773": {
    "Description": "An attacker with the ability to generate session IDs or password reset tokens, either by being able to authenticate or by exploiting CVE-2020-1772, may be able to predict other users session IDs, password reset tokens and automatically generated passwords.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Predictable generation of session IDs, password reset tokens, and automatically generated passwords.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Predictable tokens"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to other user accounts or reset their passwords.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can generate session IDs or password reset tokens, possibly by exploiting another vulnerability (CVE-2020-1772).",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Attacker needs the ability to generate session IDs or password reset tokens, which could be achieved by being authenticated as a low privileged user, or by exploiting another vulnerability."

    "CVE-2020-1766": {
      "Description": "Due to improper handling of uploaded images it is possible in very unlikely and rare conditions to force the agents browser to execute malicious javascript from a special crafted SVG file rendered as inline jpg file.",
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of uploaded images, specifically crafted SVG files.",
       "Weaknesses":[
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
       "Impact": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within an agent's browser session.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file disguised as a JPG. When an agent views this image in the browser, the malicious script executes.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs the ability to upload a crafted SVG file. This may require an authenticated user role with such privileges."
