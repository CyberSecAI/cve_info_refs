{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The default signing key for JWT cookies used by Kiali was hardcoded and publicly known.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a hardcoded cryptographic key",
      "Improper validation of credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could forge JWT tokens, bypass Kiali authentication, and gain unauthorized access. This could allow the attacker to view logs, metrics, alter Istio configurations, and perform other administrative functions within Kiali.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can forge JWT cookies using the known default signing key.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs knowledge of the hardcoded signing key, which was available in the source code.  In the case of OpenShift ServiceMesh Kiali, the attacker would first need to capture a valid session token as well."
