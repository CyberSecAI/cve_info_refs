Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a logic error within the system when specific configurations differ between the guest and host user modes on certain Huawei smartphones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that the system fails to properly authenticate the user when switching between guest and host modes under certain conditions.
- **Logic Error:** A flaw in the system's logic allows for the bypass of the host user's screen lock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with guest user privileges can gain immediate access to the host user's desktop without needing to unlock the screen lock, thus bypassing authentication mechanisms.
- This grants unauthorized access to the host user's data and applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves the presence of a guest user account and the exploitation of the logic error in the system.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific configuration mismatch between the guest and host modes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have physical access to the device.
- The attacker must have access to a guest user account.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in HUAWEI Mate 20 devices running versions earlier than 9.1.0.139(C00E133R3P1).
- Huawei released a software update to address the issue (version 9.1.0.139(C00E133R3P1) or later).
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSSv3 base score of 3.2 (AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating that the attack requires physical access and has low impact on Confidentiality and Integrity and none on Availability.
- The exploit is feasible as per the temporal score of 3.0 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
