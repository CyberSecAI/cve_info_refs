  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the DirectComposition SetBufferProperty function in the kernel. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it within the DirectComposition SetBufferProperty function in the kernel.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Use-after-free"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
  "attack_vectors": "Local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code.",
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
