Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `openshift/postgresql-apb` container was found to incorrectly modify the permissions of the `/etc/passwd` file, making it writable by users other than root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the modification of `/etc/passwd` file permissions, allowing non-root users to write to it.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This write access to `/etc/passwd` allows an attacker to modify the file, potentially adding a new user with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with access to the affected container can modify `/etc/passwd` to create a new user, potentially with root privileges or other high privileges. This enables them to gain unauthorized control of the container.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Container Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the running container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Container:** The attacker needs to have some access (e.g., through a compromised application, an exposed service within the container) to the container where the vulnerable `openshift/postgresql-apb` is running.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not exploitable in unprivileged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform by default due to the default `seccomp` policy blocking `SETUID` and `SETGID` system calls, which are needed for changing user IDs and gaining elevated privileges.
*   This vulnerability is specific to the `openshift/postgresql-apb` container.
*   The issue was addressed in multiple Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions.
*   The fix was released via the following errata: RHSA-2020:0617, RHSA-2020:0681, RHSA-2020:0694, and RHSA-2020:0801.
