Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1745:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly addresses CVE-2020-1745, detailing its impact on NetApp products and providing remediation information. The title of the advisory `CVE-2020-1745 Undertow Vulnerability in NetApp Products` and the included CVSS score are a direct match to the CVE. Therefore this content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the Undertow component incorporated in several NetApp products. Specifically, Undertow versions prior to 2.0.30.Final are susceptible. The vulnerability is related to the AJP connector in Undertow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **AJP File Read/Inclusion:** The AJP connector is vulnerable to file read/inclusion. This enables an attacker to read web application files from a vulnerable server.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In cases where the vulnerable server allows file uploads, an attacker could upload malicious JavaServer Pages (JSP) code within various file types and then trigger the vulnerability to achieve remote code execution.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive files within the web application.
    *   **Data Addition or Modification:**  Attackers might be able to add or modify data by exploiting the file inclusion vulnerability to upload and execute malicious code.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can potentially be exploited to launch a denial-of-service attack.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the AJP connector, which listens on a default port 8009. The attack vector is network based, and an attacker could be unauthenticated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the vulnerable system, specifically to the AJP port (default 8009).
    *   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
    *  **File Upload Capability (for RCE):** To achieve Remote Code Execution, the attacker also requires the capability to upload files onto the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content confirms that NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability.
*   The advisory lists the NetApp products affected by this vulnerability: NetApp Service Level Manager and OnCommand Workflow Automation.
*   It also lists many NetApp products that are not affected.
*   NetApp Service Level Manager has no plan to address this vulnerability and the advisory points to an End-of-Availability (EOA) announcement.
*   A fix is available for OnCommand Workflow Automation through a software download.
*   The content provides workarounds by disabling or securing the AJP connector.
*   The content provides a link to the NetApp support website where fixes can be obtained and technical support contact information.
*   The CVSS score for CVE-2020-1745 is 9.8 (CRITICAL), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The content suggests that the vulnerability is similar to the Ghostcat vulnerability affecting Apache Tomcat.
