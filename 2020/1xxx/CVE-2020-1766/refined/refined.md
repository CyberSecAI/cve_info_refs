Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-1766:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of uploaded images, specifically SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The system fails to properly sanitize or process uploaded SVG files, allowing them to potentially contain malicious JavaScript.
- When an SVG file is rendered as an inline image (e.g., within a ticket article), the malicious JavaScript embedded within the SVG can be executed in the agent's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Malicious JavaScript code execution in the context of the agent user's browser, potentially leading to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Data theft
   - Further attacks on the OTRS system or other systems the agent can access

**Attack Vectors:**
- Uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript. This can occur through various means like attachments, inline images, or profile uploads.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an agent views content in the system where a malicious SVG file has been rendered as inline image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the system. This could be an agent or potentially a customer if they have the necessary permissions.
- The attacker does not need high privileges to exploit. Low privs are sufficient to inject malicious code via SVG file.
- No direct user interaction on the agent's side is required, other than viewing ticket content.
- The attack is triggered when an agent user views the content, which loads the malicious SVG file, so they need to be in a position to view tickets or similar places where the SVG is rendered.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as having a low risk level due to the 'rare and unlikely conditions' for triggering it.
- The vulnerability is fixed by sanitizing uploaded SVG content to remove or disable potentially malicious code like JavaScript.
- Patches are provided that disable javascript from being executed in uploaded SVG files when rendered inline.
