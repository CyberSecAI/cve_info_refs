# Apache Dubbo Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2020-1948) Threat Alert

### Apache Dubbo Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2020-1948) Threat Alert

July 2, 2020 | **Adeline Zhang**
![](https://nsfocusglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0702.png)
## **Overview**

Recently, Apache Dubbo was reported to contain a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2020-1948) resulting from deserialization.

Apache Dubbo is a high-performance Java RPC framework. The vulnerability exists in hessian, a default deserialization tool used by Apache Dubbo. An attacker may trigger it by sending malicious RPC requests which usually contain unidentifiable service or method names and some malicious parameter loads. When malicious parameters are deserialized, the attacker achieves the goal of executing code.

**Reference link:**

https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@dubbo.apache.org/msg06544.html
## **Affected Versions**

* 2.7.0 <= Dubbo Version <= 2.7.6
* 2.6.0 <= Dubbo Version <= 2.6.7
* All Dubbo 2.5.x versions (no official support available now)

## **Unaffected Versions**

* Dubbo Version >= 2.7.7

## **Solution**

The vendor has released a new version to fix the vulnerability. Affected users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

Address for downloading Dubbo 2.7.7:

https://github.com/apache/dubbo/releases/tag/dubbo-2.7.7
