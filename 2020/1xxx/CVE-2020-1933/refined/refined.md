Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of error responses when handling uploaded templates in Apache NiFi. Specifically, when a user uploads a template, the application does not properly sanitize the error messages that might be generated in the UI, leaving it vulnerable to malicious script injection through cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize error responses, which can include user-provided input that is then rendered in the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the NiFi UI through uploaded templates. If a user interacts with the crafted error message, the injected script will execute in the context of the user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to:
   - Steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
   - Perform actions on behalf of the user within the NiFi application.
   - Redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to create a malicious template that triggers a specific error condition during upload.
- The attacker would then need to convince an authenticated user to upload the template in Firefox (as the vulnerability is noted to primarily exist in Firefox).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious NiFi template.
- The attacker must be able to convince an authenticated user to upload this crafted template.
- The vulnerability is noted to be primarily reproducible in Firefox.

**Additional details:**
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability is present in Apache NiFi versions 1.0.0 through 1.10.0.
- The fix, implemented in version 1.11.0, includes sanitization of error responses to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
