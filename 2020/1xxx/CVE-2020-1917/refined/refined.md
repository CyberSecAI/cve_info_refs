{
  "CVE-2020-1917": {
    "Description": "out-of-bounds write (1 byte) in `exif_read_data()`",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to an insufficient size check within the `exif_read_data()` function. Specifically, when parsing EXIF data, the code reads a length value and uses it to access subsequent bytes. A crafted EXIF data can provide an invalid length, leading to an out-of-bounds write by 1 byte.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient size check",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a one-byte out-of-bounds write, potentially resulting in a crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted image file through the `exif_read_data()` function.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted image file to the vulnerable function."
