Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-1719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue in Wildfly/JBoss EAP where the `EJBContext` principal is not correctly restored after an EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) invokes another EJB that uses a different security domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Context Switching:** The core issue is a failure to properly manage and restore the security context when EJBs interact across different security domains. Specifically, after an EJB call is made to another EJB using a different security domain, the original principal is not restored.
*   **Principal Leakage:**  The `EJBContext` principal, which represents the identity of the user making the call, is not popped back to its original value after the cross-domain EJB invocation. This could cause the next operation to inherit the identity of the callee EJB.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity Violation:** The most significant impact is a potential compromise of data confidentiality and integrity. Due to the incorrect security context, a user could unintentionally, or maliciously, access or modify data to which they shouldn't have permission.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **EJB Inter-Invocation:** The attack vector involves invoking an EJB that then calls another EJB which is configured to use a different security domain.
*   **Cross-Security Domain:** The vulnerability is triggered by interactions between EJBs operating under distinct security domains.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to EJB System:** An attacker would need to be able to trigger an EJB call which will initiate an inter-EJB invocation on different security domain, and they would also need to have a different security context for the call. This suggests the attacker would need to be a user who can execute these EJBs and have the ability to cause this chain reaction to occur.
*   **Knowledge of the System:** The attacker would likely need some understanding of the application's structure, the deployed EJBs, and their respective security domain configurations.

**Additional Details:**
*   The bug report mentions that this issue was fixed in Wildfly version 20.0.0.Final
*   Multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) were issued to address this vulnerability in various products, including JBoss EAP, Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes, Red Hat Data Grid, and Red Hat Fuse.
