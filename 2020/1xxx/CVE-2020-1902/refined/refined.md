The provided content is related to CVE-2020-1902.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of HTTPS usage when a user performs a quick search on a highly forwarded message. This caused the search query to be sent over plain HTTP to Google's service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure communication: The search query was transmitted over plain HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- Data leakage: Information could be exposed due to the unencrypted nature of the transmission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential exposure of user data. A malicious actor eavesdropping on the network could intercept the search query and its associated data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: An attacker positioned on the network path between the user's device and Google's service could intercept the HTTP traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept traffic (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network).
- Passive network monitoring: The attacker would passively monitor the network for unencrypted HTTP traffic.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected versions include:
   - WhatsApp for Android from v2.20.108 to v2.20.140
   - WhatsApp Business for Android from v2.20.35 to v2.20.49
