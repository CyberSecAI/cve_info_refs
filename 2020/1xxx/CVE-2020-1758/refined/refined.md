Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of TLS hostname verification in Keycloak when sending emails via an SMTP server. This means that Keycloak does not properly check if the hostname in the server's TLS certificate matches the hostname it is connecting to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper TLS Hostname Verification:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to perform hostname verification during TLS connections with the SMTP server used for sending emails. This opens up the possibility for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Due to the missing verification, an attacker could potentially intercept communication between the Keycloak server and the SMTP server which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained in those emails, such as password reset links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** A successful MITM attack could allow an attacker to intercept email communications.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The intercepted emails could contain sensitive data, such as password reset links, which could be used to compromise user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based MITM:** An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the Keycloak server and the SMTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have control over a network segment through which the communication between the Keycloak server and SMTP server passes. This could involve being on the same network or having the ability to intercept/redirect network traffic.
*   **Certificate Spoofing:** The attacker would need to have a certificate with a hostname that Keycloak would connect to, which would not be verified.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Keycloak's email functionality specifically.
*   Red Hat has released updates to address this issue in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 for RHEL 6, 7, 8, and 7.3.8
*   A workaround is provided which is to disable all email notifications.
