- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper processing of specific IPSEC packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way the firewall handles specifically crafted IPSEC packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the abnormal functioning of the IPSEC feature on the affected device, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can send constructed IPSEC packets to the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected devices and the IPSEC function must be enabled.
