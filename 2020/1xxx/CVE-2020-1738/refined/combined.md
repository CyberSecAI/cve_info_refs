##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2020-1738](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f85h-23mf-2fwh "CVE-2020-1738")

Both `package` and `service` modules use facts to determine the name of the module to run if `use` is not passed to the module. The `ansible_facts['pkg_mgr']` and `ansible_facts['service_mgr']` facts could be set to another module name or a module name installed in a collection such as `ansible_collections.namespace.name./tmp/reverse-shell`, which would allow arbitrary code execution on the managed node.

A potential fix would be to whitelist valid modules for `package` and `service` and/or have the collection loader validate the collection path to not allow arbitrary files.

The collection loader part may already be fixed in 2.9.

## Description

A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when the module package or service is used and the parameter 'use' is not specified. If a previous task is executed with a malicious user, the module sent can be selected by the attacker using the ansible facts file. All versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2020-1738](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f85h-23mf-2fwh "CVE-2020-1738")

Both `package` and `service` modules use facts to determine the name of the module to run if `use` is not passed to the module. The `ansible_facts['pkg_mgr']` and `ansible_facts['service_mgr']` facts could be set to another module name or a module name installed in a collection such as `ansible_collections.namespace.name./tmp/reverse-shell`, which would allow arbitrary code execution on the managed node.

A potential fix would be to whitelist valid modules for `package` and `service` and/or have the collection loader validate the collection path to not allow arbitrary files.

The collection loader part may already be fixed in 2.9.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-12 13:54:01 UTC  ``` When the module package or service is used and the parameter 'use' is not specified, the module that will be sent to the node is selected by the ansible_fact.  If a previous task is executed with a malicious user, the module sent can be selected by the attacker.  Additionally, if an Ansible collections are installed the attacker can send the module name to send a reverse shell in temp folder to the node as a binary module.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c2)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-17 12:57:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Damien Aumaitre (Quarkslab), Nicolas Surbayrole (Quarkslab)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c4)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-02-19 07:18:36 UTC  ``` Borja, is there any upstream reference for this ansible issue?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c5)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-20 16:43:59 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1805326](show_bug.cgi?id=1805326 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-1738 ansible: module package can be selected by the ansible facts [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1805325](show_bug.cgi?id=1805325 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-1738 ansible: module package can be selected by the ansible facts [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c6)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-20 17:01:53 UTC  ``` Hey Salvatore, I am working to provide additional information regarding this issue; more details as you requested, affected versions as well as upstream links in case we already have. Prioritising this for now, I will get back to you asap.  In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c4): > Borja, is there any upstream reference for this ansible issue?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c9)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-02-20 22:45:00 UTC  ``` Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.9 is in maintenance phase and we're no longer fixing "Low" severity CVEs.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c13)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-27 10:21:40 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67796>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c14)  Borja Tarraso    2020-02-27 12:19:34 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1807878](show_bug.cgi?id=1807878 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-1738 ansible: module package can be selected by the ansible facts [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c16)  Hardik Vyas    2020-03-18 16:21:10 UTC  ``` Red Hat Gluster Storage and Red Hat Ceph Storage no longer maintains its own version of Ansible. The fix will be provided from core Ansible. But we still ship ansible separately for ceph ubuntu.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c19)  Borja Tarraso    2020-03-27 07:27:02 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Specify the parameter 'use' when possible on the package and service modules. Avoid using Ansible Collections on Ansible 2.8.9 or 2.7.16 (and any of the previous versions) as they are not rejecting python with no path (already fixed in 2.9.x).   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c20)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-05-11 09:46:30 UTC  ``` CloudForms 5.11 do not use ansible-tower and 5.10 only using ansible-tower-venv-ansible atm.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1802164#c21)  Summer Long    2021-01-14 05:01:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  Ansible Engine 2.7.16, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.  Ansible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.   ``` |  |
