**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a predictable temporary filename in PAN-OS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure Temporary File Handling (CWE-377): The system creates temporary files with predictable names, which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local Privilege Escalation: A local attacker who has bypassed the restricted shell can exploit this vulnerability to execute commands with low privileges and ultimately gain root access.
- Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to control the PAN-OS hardware or virtual appliance completely.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Bypassed Restricted Shell: The attacker must have already bypassed the restricted shell environment to leverage this vulnerability.
- Low Privileged User: The attacker initially needs to be a low privileged user on the system.

**Affected Versions:**
- PAN-OS 8.1 versions prior to 8.1.13.
- Not affected are PAN-OS 7.1, PAN-OS 9.0, and later PAN-OS versions.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 8.1.13 or later versions.
- Follow best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface to reduce exposure to potential attackers.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered internally.
- The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 7, which is considered HIGH severity.
