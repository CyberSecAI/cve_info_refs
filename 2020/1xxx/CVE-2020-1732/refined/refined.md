Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Soteria, a security library, handles concurrent requests when used with EE Security and WildFly Elytron. When multiple requests occur concurrently, there is a possibility that they are handled using the security identity of another request. This is due to the way the JASPIC integration was implemented, where the same `ServerAuthModule` instance was being used across multiple requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Security Identity Corruption:**  Concurrent requests could potentially use the identity of another request, leading to privilege escalation or access control bypass.
- **Shared State:** The underlying issue is the incorrect sharing of request-specific state within the `ServerAuthModule`, which is intended to be per request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The main threat is the compromise of data confidentiality and integrity, as unauthorized access might be gained through the incorrect identity. This means a malicious user could potentially access data or perform actions as if they were another legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Concurrent Requests:**  The vulnerability is triggered when multiple requests are processed concurrently. An attacker would need to send multiple, simultaneous requests to the affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the affected application to send concurrent requests.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to formulate and send HTTP requests.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that a new `ServerAuthModule` is created for each request. This was achieved by using a `Supplier<ServerAuthModule>` rather than a single instance in the `DefaultAuthConfigProvider` and `DefaultServerAuthConfig`.
- The fix was implemented by modifying the JASPIC integration to create a new `ServerAuthModule` for each request and moving the state to a ThreadLocal, so the request-specific state can be accessed from the current thread when using a common CallbackHandler instance.
- The vulnerability is related to how WildFly/Elytron integrated Soteria and is not necessarily a vulnerability in Soteria itself, according to comments.

This vulnerability was addressed in Soteria version 1.0.1 and is tracked by CVE-2020-1732.
