Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-1977

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in multiple endpoints of the Expedition Migration Tool.
*   Vulnerable endpoints include:
    *   `/bin/Objects.php`
    *   `/bin/Snippets.php`
    *   `/bin/authentication/projects/projects.php`
    *   `/bin/authentication/projects/userSettings.php`
    *   `/bin/authentication/users/userManagement.php`
    *   `/bin/configurations/parsers/loader.php`
    *   `/bin/configurations/parsers/uploader.php`
    *   `/bin/jobs/check.php`
    *  `/bin/projects/tools/filters.php`
    *   `/bin/Auth.php`
    *   `/bin/authentication/devices/assignKeys.php`
    *   Potentially other endpoints as well.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote, unauthenticated attackers can hijack the authentication of administrators.
*   Attackers can perform actions on the Expedition Migration Tool with the permissions of a victim user.
*   Potential impacts include:
    *   Manipulating Objects and Snippets
    *   Modifying projects and project details
    *   Changing user settings, including passwords (though knowledge of the current password is required)
    *   Creating and deleting users
    *   Manipulating loaded configurations
    *   Uploading arbitrary files (although file location is somewhat limited, content and size are not filtered)
    *   Compromise user credentials and create fake session
    *   Perform various other actions with the victim's permissions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via network requests.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Successful exploitation requires the victim (an administrator) to have an active session and to be tricked into triggering a malicious request (e.g., by visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker is external and does not need prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs to craft malicious requests targeting vulnerable endpoints of the Expedition Migration Tool.
*   The attacker needs to trick a legitimate, logged-in user into triggering these malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in Expedition Migration Tool versions 1.1.51 and earlier.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.52 and later.
* The Tenable advisory specifically mentions the ability to trick a user into providing their password for changing user settings, if password change is part of the malicious request.

**Severity:**
*   CVSSv3.1 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH)
*   CVSSv2 Base Score: 6.8 (Medium), Temporal Score: 6.5
*   CVSSv3 Base Score: 8.8 (High)

This vulnerability allows an attacker to fully take over the Expedition Migration Tool if they can get a logged-in administrator to unknowingly trigger a malicious request.
