Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that when an agent user in OTRS is renamed or invalidated, their existing session remains active. This means that the session is not immediately terminated or invalidated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Session Handling:** The primary vulnerability is improper session management. The system fails to invalidate a user's session when their account is modified or disabled.
-   **Authorization Bypass:** While the session cannot access ticket data if the agent is invalid, the fact that the session remains active creates a potential vector for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** Although the description notes that "the session cannot be used to access ticket data in the case the agent is invalid," the session might still be used to access other features or information, which is not explicitly ruled out in the description.
-   **Potential Impersonation/Unauthorized Access:** The advisory states that other vulnerabilities that leave sessions active could be exploited to impersonate the agent user; this suggests that an active session can be exploited if combined with another vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **User Account Modification:** An attacker with administrative privileges could rename or invalidate an agent user while their session remains active.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs the ability to modify user accounts (rename or invalidate agents). This typically requires administrative or similar elevated privileges within the OTRS system.
-   **Existing Session Knowledge:** While not explicitly stated, it would be beneficial for the attacker to somehow have access or knowledge of a currently logged in user session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "LOW" severity with a CVSS score of 3.5
*   **Affected Versions:** OTRS 8.0.x versions prior to 8.0.5, OTRS 7.0.x versions prior to 7.0.19, and ((OTRS)) Community Edition 6.0.x versions prior to 6.0.29 are affected.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading to the specified versions of OTRS or applying the provided patch for the Community Edition.
*   **External Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered during an external security research, as noted by the advisory.
