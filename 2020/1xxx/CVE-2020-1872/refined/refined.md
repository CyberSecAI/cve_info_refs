- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability occurs during the re-configuration of a mobile phone in digital balance mode. An attacker can bypass the startup wizard via specific actions and enable certain switches. This allows the attacker to bypass the digital balance function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the startup wizard when the device is being reconfigured in digital balance mode, allowing for a bypass.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the digital balance feature.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical possession of the affected Huawei smart phone and must be able to reconfigure the device in digital balance mode.
