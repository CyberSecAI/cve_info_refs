- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to improper handling of malformed local videos with E-AC-3 audio streams.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Buffer overflow, out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows for an out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Processing malformed local videos containing E-AC-3 audio streams.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious local video with a specific malformed E-AC-3 audio stream, and have the victim process it on a vulnerable device.
