Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-1984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Secdo software attempts to execute a script from a hardcoded path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the software uses a hardcoded path to execute a script, which can be influenced by a local user, specifically if the folder in the path does not exist or the path is writeable by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user with the ability to create folders or append data at the root of the OS disk (e.g., C:\) or on a directory named C:\Common can gain system-level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attacker must have local access to the system where Secdo is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user.
*   **File System Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to create folders or append data to the root directory (e.g. C:\) or C:\Common directory if it exists.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Secdo for Windows.
*   The vendor has stated that the product is no longer supported and will not be patched.
*   Mitigation involves ensuring that unprivileged users do not have write access to the root directory and/or create folder access on the root drive or a directory named C:\Common
