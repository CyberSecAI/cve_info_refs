Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-20225:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a reachable assertion failure within the `/nova/bin/user` process of MikroTik RouterOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Assertion Failure:** A specific condition within the `/nova/bin/user` process, when violated, triggers an assertion failure, leading to process termination. This indicates a lack of proper input validation or error handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the assertion failure, causing the `/nova/bin/user` process to crash. This results in a denial of service, impacting the functionality reliant on this process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Packet:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the affected MikroTik RouterOS device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Remote Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the MikroTik RouterOS device remotely. This indicates that it is not an unauthenticated vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was present in RouterOS versions prior to 6.47 (stable tree).
*   The issue was initially found in the long-term 6.44.6 branch and fixed in stable 6.47.
*   The provided crash dump confirms a signal 6 (SIGABRT) caused by the assertion failure.
