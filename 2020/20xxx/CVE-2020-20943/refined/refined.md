The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Qibo CMS v7, including CSRF, Stored XSS, and Arbitrary File Deletion.

**1. CSRF in publishing articles:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection and missing Referer header check in the article posting functionality.
*   **Weaknesses:** Absence of CSRF tokens and Referer header validation, allowing for cross-site request forgery attacks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to publish articles with attacker-controlled content without the user's knowledge or consent.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a malicious HTML page with a crafted form that submits to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to host the malicious HTML page on a web server and lure a logged-in user to visit it.

**2. CSRF to Privilege Escalation (add an super administrator):**

*  **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection on the user management functionality.
*  **Weaknesses:** Absence of CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to forge requests to change user groups.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can promote a regular user to an administrator account without the admin's consent.
*  **Attack Vector:** Similar to the first CSRF vulnerability, the attacker creates a malicious webpage to change the user group through a crafted form.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to host the malicious HTML page and trick an admin user into visiting it while logged in to the target application.

**3. Stored XSS in background:**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate input sanitization in the friend link management feature.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization allows injecting malicious JavaScript code into the database via the friend link URL field.
*   **Impact:** Persistent execution of JavaScript code in the admin panel when the admin views the friend links, enabling session hijacking or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Posting a crafted friend link entry via the admin interface.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin interface of the application.

**4. Arbitrary File Deletion in background:**

*   **Root Cause:** Directory traversal vulnerability when deleting database backups.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application uses a user-controlled parameter `baktime` without proper validation, allowing the attacker to use directory traversal sequences such as `../` to reach outside the intended directory.
*  **Impact:** The attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server that the webserver has access to, potentially causing denial of service or other forms of damage
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with the `baktime` parameter set to a path outside the backup directory.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin interface of the application.
