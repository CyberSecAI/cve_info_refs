## Description

![@Rrooach](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40165558?u=e7c289838b6c9fce3e75416fa713478db503cc96&v=4&size=48)[Rrooach](https://github.com/Rrooach)opened [on Nov 6, 2019](https://github.com/cloudwu/rudp/issues/6#issue-518312732)

Hello, I found a **MEMORY LEAK** in main.c:90

**Below are steps followed to reproduce crash**

Download latest source code from: <https://github.com/cloudwu/rudp>, compiled with clang and ASAN`export CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"`before make

**ASAN Output**

```
=================================================================
==25482==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

Direct leak of 120 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
    #0 0x4b8818  (/root/temp/ICS/rudp/rudp+0x4b8818)
    #1 0x4e9d94  (/root/temp/ICS/rudp/rudp+0x4e9d94)

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 120 byte(s) leaked in 1 allocation(s).

```

it seems that you have a double free issue.
