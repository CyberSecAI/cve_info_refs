Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-20453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Division by zero error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is located in `libavcodec/aaccoder.c` at lines 554 and 556.
- Specifically, the code performs division operations where the divisor `s->lambda` can be zero, leading to a division-by-zero error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The division by zero error can cause the program to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing of a malformed multimedia file/stream.
- Specifically, a crafted input file (`tmp.wmv` in the provided example) with specific properties causing  `s->lambda` to be zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to FFmpeg.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when encoding audio using the AAC encoder.
- The fix involves checking if the divisor is zero, and avoiding the division if it is (see [https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2021-May/280730.html](https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2021-May/280730.html) and commit `a7a7f32c8ad0179a1a85d0a8cff35924e6d90be8`).

- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA) indicates that this vulnerability, among others, can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution, but this particular vulnerability only causes a DoS due to the division by zero.
