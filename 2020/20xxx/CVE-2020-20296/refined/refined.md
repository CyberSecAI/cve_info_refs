- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rechargeAction` function in `cmswing/src/controller/admin/user.js` directly uses user-supplied input (`data.balance`) in an SQL query without sufficient sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability. The `data.balance` value is used in an `increment` SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service. In the example, the attacker injected a `sleep()` function to demonstrate the successful injection, but more dangerous queries could be used.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the user recharge functionality in the admin panel where the `balance` parameter can be manipulated with malicious sql code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the administrative panel and to the user recharge functionality.
