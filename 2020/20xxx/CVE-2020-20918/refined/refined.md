{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application saves a hidden parameter passed via a POST request to PHP without properly escaping special characters, particularly the single quote ('). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code by closing the existing PHP syntax and adding their own.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote command execution",
      "Improper input sanitization",
       "Lack of output encoding"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities. In this specific report, the attacker demonstrates executing phpinfo() to confirm the vulnerability and demonstrates remote command execution with a webshell.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector": "By crafting a malicious POST request to the 'admin.php?action=editpage' endpoint, an attacker can inject malicious code via the `hidden` parameter.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires access to the admin panel. The attacker must be able to create/edit pages and intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a tool like Burp Suite or equivalent. The attack needs to be able to modify a hidden form parameter via a POST request."
