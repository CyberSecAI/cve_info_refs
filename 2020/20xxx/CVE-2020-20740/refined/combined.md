## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 33 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [BINUTILS235](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS235 "Changes/BINUTILS235")
* [CMake to do out-of-source builds](/wiki/Changes/CMake_to_do_out-of-source_builds "Changes/CMake to do out-of-source builds")
* [Aarch64 PointerAuthentication](/wiki/Changes/Aarch64_PointerAuthentication "Changes/Aarch64 PointerAuthentication")
* [Java11](/wiki/Changes/Java11 "Changes/Java11")
* [Sqlite Rpmdb](/wiki/Changes/Sqlite_Rpmdb "Changes/Sqlite Rpmdb")
* [RPM 4.16](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.16 "Changes/RPM-4.16")
* [F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 22nd. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f33
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f33. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f33 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f33
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-27 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

Package        : pdfresurrect
Version        : 0.12-6+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14934 CVE-2020-20740

Vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdfresurrect, a tool for
analyzing and manipulating revisions to PDF documents.

CVE-2019-14934

    pdf_load_pages_kids in pdf.c doesn't validate a certain size value,
    which leads to a malloc failure and out-of-bounds write

CVE-2020-20740

    lack of header validation checks causes heap-buffer-overflow in
    pdf_get_version()

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.12-6+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdfresurrect packages.

For the detailed security status of pdfresurrect please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pdfresurrect>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : pdfresurrect
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 0.21
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <https://github.com/enferex/pdfresurrect>
Summary : PDF Analysis and Scrubbing Utility
Description :
PDFResurrect is a tool aimed at analyzing PDF documents. The PDF format
allows for previous document changes to be retained in a more recent
version of the document, thereby creating a running history of changes
for the document. This tool attempts to extract all previous versions
while also producing a summary of changes between versions. This tool
can also "scrub" or write data over the original instances of PDF objects

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-92195be0e2
2020-12-04 00:30:05.645429
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : pdfresurrect
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 0.21
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <https://github.com/enferex/pdfresurrect>
Summary : PDF Analysis and Scrubbing Utility
Description :
PDFResurrect is a tool aimed at analyzing PDF documents. The PDF format
allows for previous document changes to be retained in a more recent
version of the document, thereby creating a running history of changes
for the document. This tool attempts to extract all previous versions
while also producing a summary of changes between versions. This tool
can also "scrub" or write data over the original instances of PDF objects
that have been modified or deleted, in an effort to disguise information
from previous versions that might not be intended for anyone else to read.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
