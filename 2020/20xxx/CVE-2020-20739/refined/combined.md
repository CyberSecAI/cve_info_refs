## Description

![@yifengchen-cc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33726689?u=bed6cb16fc0a69b8aeb9d50b67201d1e47725c81&v=4&size=48)[yifengchen-cc](https://github.com/yifengchen-cc)opened [on Sep 3, 2019](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/issues/1419#issue-488562230)

/libvips/libvips/deprecated/im\_vips2dz.c:79

When the output file does not contain a ":"，the uninitialization of the mode causes the stack information to leak.

This may cause the leakage of remote server path.

`$./vips im_vips2dz /home/ivan/miniproject/libvips/tools/.libs/th.vips th.dz`

`im_vips2dz: enum 'VipsForeignDzLayout' has no member 'roject/libvips/tools/.libs/th.vips', should be one of: dz, zoomify, google`

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
