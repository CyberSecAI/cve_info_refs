Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `list_rowsAction` function within the `/src/core/controllers/cm.php` file of Gila CMS. Specifically, the `$_GET` parameters are directly passed to the `getRows` function without any filtering or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is SQL injection. By manipulating the `$_GET` parameters, particularly the 'search' parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user information, configurations, and other application-related data.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data in the database, potentially compromising the integrity of the CMS.
- **Full Server Compromise:** Depending on the database user's privileges, it might be possible to execute system-level commands. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server where the application is hosted.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `cm/list_rows/` endpoint with malicious SQL code injected in the `search` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Gila CMS instance.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payload.
- **No Authentication Required:** It is stated that this vulnerability can be exploited after the administrator logs in, meaning a user doesn't necessarily need admin rights to exploit this.
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must target the vulnerable `cm/list_rows/` endpoint.
- **Vulnerable parameters:** The attacker must use the `search` parameter to inject the payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to inject a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement, which is a common technique for extracting data from the database.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `list_rows` function which is called by the `list_rowsAction` function.
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.11.4 of Gila CMS.
- The issue was reported on October 13, 2019.
- The attacker does not need administrator access to exploit this vulnerability, but rather they must be logged in to the website.
