{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on the `Iec10x_Sta_Addr` variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The program does not validate the `Iec10x_Sta_Addr` variable before using it to access memory. If `Iec10x_Sta_Addr` has an unexpected value, it can cause a write beyond the bounds of the `Iec104_RecvBuf` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.",
        "Lack of proper input validation on `Iec10x_Sta_Addr` allows for out-of-bounds memory access."
    ],
    "impact": "A stack buffer overflow can lead to program termination, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when the `asdu->_addr` does not match `Iec10x_Sta_Addr`",
       "By providing a specially crafted input with an invalid value for `Iec10x_Sta_Addr`"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted IEC 104 messages to the vulnerable server to trigger the out of bounds write.",
