  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database. This allows a malicious user to inject XSS payloads into various fields through the administrative interface.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Article source field",
      "Menu link field",
      "Link address field"
    ],
