The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Qibo CMS v7:

**1. CSRF in publishing articles:**
   - **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection and referer checking in the article posting functionality.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
   - **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to publish articles with attacker-controlled content without the user's knowledge.
   - **Attack vectors:**  A malicious HTML page containing a crafted form that submits data to the vulnerable endpoint.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to host a malicious webpage and trick a logged-in user to visit it.

**2. CSRF to Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in the user editing functionality.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
   - **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate the privileges of an arbitrary user to an administrator account.
   - **Attack vectors:**  A malicious HTML page containing a crafted form that submits data to the vulnerable endpoint.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to host a malicious webpage and trick a logged-in admin user to visit it.

**3. Stored XSS in background:**
   - **Root cause:** Insufficient input sanitization when adding friend links in the admin panel.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute when an admin user views the friend links page in the admin panel.
   - **Attack vectors:**  Crafting a malicious friend link with JavaScript payload in the URL field.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the admin panel to add a friend link.

**4. Arbitrary File Deletion in background:**
   - **Root cause:**  Insufficient input validation when deleting database backups in the admin panel.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Arbitrary file deletion via path traversal.
   - **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the 'baktime' parameter.
   - **Attack vectors:**  Sending a crafted POST request with a 'baktime' parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to reach and delete files outside the intended backup directory.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the admin panel to delete database backups.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**

*   The blog post describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CSRF, Stored XSS, and arbitrary file deletion, all within the Qibo CMS v7.
*   CSRF vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user, including publishing content and privilege escalation.
*   The Stored XSS vulnerability allows for persistent execution of malicious JavaScript code.
*   The arbitrary file deletion vulnerability allows for removing files on the server.
*   The blog post also shows how some vulnerabilities can be combined for greater impact, such as combining arbitrary file deletion with CSRF.
