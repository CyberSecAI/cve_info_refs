The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in White Shark System (wss) version 1.3.2. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for each vulnerability:

**[1] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `sort` parameter in `control_task.php`, `control_project.php`, and `default_user.php`. The `GetSQLValueString` function, when the `type` is defined, does not process the input leading to unfiltered data being directly inserted into the database query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `sort` parameter to the vulnerable PHP files.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with network access to the application.

**[2] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `csa_to_user` parameter in `default_task_edituser.php`. The input is directly used in a database query without proper filtering.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious `csa_to_user` parameter to the `default_task_edituser.php` file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with network access to the application.

**[3] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `date` parameter in `log_edit.php`. The input is directly used in a database query without any filtering, bypassing the `GetSQLValueString` function.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive database information.
*    **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `date` parameter to the `log_edit.php` file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with network access to the application.

**[4] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `user_edit_password.php` file does not verify the original password before modifying a user's password. The system solely relies on the `ID` parameter from `$_POST` to identify the target user for password modification.
*   **Weakness:**  Missing password verification allowing unauthorized password modification.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify the password of any user without knowing their original password, including the administrator.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with the target user's ID (`ID`) and the new password to `user_edit_password.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user with network access to the application.

**[5] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The application lacks CSRF protection, specifically the `user_edit_password.php` is vulnerable to CSRF.
*   **Weakness:** Missing CSRF protection leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
*  **Impact:** Remote attackers can force authenticated users to modify their password by tricking them into accessing a malicious crafted page
*   **Attack Vector:** Trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious HTML page that sends a crafted POST request to `user_edit_password.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker who can trick an authenticated user to visit the malicious page.

**[6] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `default_user_edit.php` file checks the current user's UID against the queried UID to prevent unauthorized viewing of other user details but when updating user details, it directly uses the `ID` parameter from `$_POST` without proper verification.
*  **Weakness:** Inconsistent user ID handling during user update allows modification of other users' information.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify the information of other users, including the admin, and escalate their privileges by modifying the user rank through manipulation of the `ID` parameter during the update process.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with the target user's ID and modified user data to `default_user_edit.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user with network access to the application.

**[7] Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `if_get_addbook.php` file lacks proper authentication and authorization checks. It retrieves all user data without verifying the user's identity by using a default token value.
*  **Weakness:**  Lack of access control and usage of a default token to access all user data.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can obtain username information for all users of the site.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with a default token to `if_get_addbook.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with network access to the application.

**[8] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `default_task_add.php` file allows manipulation of the `csa_create_user` parameter, which determines the user who created the task. By setting this to the admin's UID, any user can create a task on behalf of the administrator.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of validation on the user ID that creates the task.
*  **Impact:** Remote attackers can create tasks on behalf of other users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `default_task_add.php` with a forged `csa_create_user` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Authenticated user with network access to the application.

**[9] Website Physical Path Leakage**
*   **Root Cause:** The application reveals the physical path of the server in multiple files such as  `control_file.php`, `control_log.php`, `control_project.php`, `control_task.php`, and `tree.php`
*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure of the server's file paths.
*   **Impact:** This could give an attacker further information for exploitation
*   **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing one of the listed files in a browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with network access to the application.
