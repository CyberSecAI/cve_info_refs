Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-20095:

**Summary:**

The provided GitHub repository mentions CVE-2020-20095, along with other CVEs (2020-20093, 20094, 20096 and 2022-28345), in the context of "RTLO Injection URI Spoofing". This suggests the repository contains code or information related to this type of vulnerability.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Weakness:** The core vulnerability is **RTLO (Right-to-Left Override) injection**, which can be used to create spoofed URIs. The use of RTLO character within a URI string can alter the visual representation of the URI, making it appear legitimate while pointing to a malicious resource.
*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the insufficient sanitization or validation of user-controlled input (URIs), which allows the injection of RTLO characters.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to **URI spoofing**, where users are tricked into clicking on what appears to be a trustworthy link, but in reality, they are redirected to a malicious website or resource.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a URI that contains the RTLO character(s). The malicious URI is crafted to deceive a user into believing it is a legitimate URI.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to insert a malicious URI containing RTLO character into an environment that a user is likely to interact with. This can include websites, messaging applications, or other platforms that display URIs.

**Additional Details:**
* The repository `zadewg/RIUS` seems to contain proof-of-concept code (`poc.py`, `exploit.sh`) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
* The repository also includes sample media files, such as `imessage.mp4`, `instagram.gif`, `messenger.jpeg`, and `whatsapp.gif`, which might be used in exploits or demonstrations of the RTLO spoofing.
