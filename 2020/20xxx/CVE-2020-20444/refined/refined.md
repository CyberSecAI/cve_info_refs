- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `view_source.php` file in OpenClinic allows users to specify a file path via the `file` parameter. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for local file inclusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files which may contain sensitive data.  The report also mentions that this could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) though that's not directly detailed in this report.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `view_source.php` with a malicious `file` parameter containing paths to local files using `../` path traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the `view_source.php` endpoint. The report suggests that being logged in as an administrator is a precondition for this exploit.
