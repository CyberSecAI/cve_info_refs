## Description

![@feizi76](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54434216?u=fa749e63f7ddd6c9e9415833022b02bcae110adb&v=4&size=48)[feizi76](https://github.com/feizi76)opened [on Aug 23, 2019](https://github.com/top-think/thinkphp/issues/553#issue-484433930)

I found a lot of such code in our extensive penetration test.

`$sql=$Data->query("select * from users where id=$id"); $sql=$Data->where("id=$id")->select();`

Such code is not pre-processed by sql during preprocessing. can be seen

`protected function parseSql($sql,$parse) { if(true === $parse) { $options = $this->_parseOptions(); $sql = $this->db->parseSql($sql,$options); }elseif(is_array($parse)){ // SQL预处理 $parse = array_map(array($this->db,'escapeString'),$parse); $sql = vsprintf($sql,$parse); }else{ $sql = strtr($sql,array('__TABLE__'=>$this->getTableName(),'__PREFIX__'=>C('DB_PREFIX'))); } $this->db->setModel($this->name); return $sql; }`

or

`public function where($where,$parse=null){

if(!is\_null($parse) && is\_string($where)) {

if(!is\_array($parse)) {

$parse = func\_get\_args();

array\_shift($parse);

}

$parse = array\_map(array($this->db,'escapeString'),$parse);

$where = vsprintf($where,$parse);

}elseif(is\_object($where)){

$where = get\_object\_vars($where);

}

if(is\_string($where) && '' != $where){

$map = array();

$map['\_string'] = $where;

$where = $map;

}

if(isset($this->options['where'])){

$this->options['where'] = array\_merge($this->options['where'],$where);

}else{

$this->options['where'] = $where;

}

```
return $this;

```

} `

And the official website also has a lot of such writings.<http://www.thinkphp.cn/extend/246.html>

Are all wrong demonstrations that will cause more SQL injection

Sql injection can also be performed in the MODEL.class.php limit function and the order function.

`public function limit($offset,$length=null){ $this->options['limit'] = is_null($length)?$offset:$offset.','.$length; return $this; } $sql=$Data->where("id=$id")->order($id);`
