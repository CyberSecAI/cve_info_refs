- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CE Remote Display service does not close incoming connections on the Windows CE side when incorrect credentials are provided. This allows a modified CE Remote Host client to establish a connection without proper authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication handling, lack of connection termination on invalid login attempts, use of an unencrypted protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the CE Remote Display, potentially allowing an attacker to control the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks using a modified CE Remote Host client that circumvents the authentication mechanism by exploiting the lack of connection closure on invalid logins.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the network with the target device and use a custom client.
