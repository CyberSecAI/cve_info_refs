Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20451:

**CVE Description:**

The CVE description states that it is a "Denial of Service issue due to resource management errors via fftools/cmdutils.c."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a memory leak within the `fftools/cmdutils.c` file, specifically related to how the command-line options are parsed and handled. The issue occurs when the parsing of options fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak that occurs when parsing command-line options. This is evident from the ASAN and Valgrind reports which indicate memory is allocated but not freed when option parsing fails.
-   **Resource Management Error**: Improper resource management during option processing leads to the memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. Repeatedly triggering the memory leak by providing specific input options will exhaust available memory, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Command Line Input:** The attack vector is through crafted or malformed command-line input options provided to the `ffmpeg` tool. The provided example command line demonstrates how the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute the `ffmpeg` tool and provide command-line arguments. This could be through local access or a web interface or API that uses ffmpeg.
-   **Understanding of Command Options:** The attacker needs to understand how to provide specific options that will trigger the memory leak.
-   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't require any elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
-   **Triggering the failure**: The vulnerability is triggered when a specific combination of options is provided that leads to an error during processing, resulting in a memory leak.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided content from `trac.ffmpeg.org` includes the initial bug report with ASAN and Valgrind outputs, which details the specific locations of the memory leaks (`realloc`, `grow_array`, `av_realloc`, `av_strdup`, `parse_optgroup`).
-   The `lists.debian.org` content confirms that CVE-2020-20451 is indeed a DoS vulnerability caused by resource management errors within `fftools/cmdutils.c` and that a patch was released to fix the issue.
-   The provided fix was in changeset `21265f42ecb265debe9fec1dbfd0cb7de5a8aefb`
