Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-20231:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `detnet` process has a memory corruption vulnerability. Specifically, a crafted network packet leads to a NULL pointer dereference within the `detnet` process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** The vulnerability is caused by the program attempting to access memory via a NULL pointer, causing a crash.
- **Memory corruption:**  The crafted packet is the trigger, indicating a flaw in how the `detnet` process handles or parses network packets, ultimately leading to memory corruption and the NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the `detnet` process crashing, leading to a denial of service. This crash is evident in the provided backtrace log which shows the `detnet` process terminating due to signal 11.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated remote user:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to send crafted packets to the vulnerable device. The attacker needs network access to the device.
