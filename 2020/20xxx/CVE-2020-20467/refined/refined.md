Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described for White Shark System (wss) 1.3.2:

**[1] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper filtering of the `sort` parameter in `control_task.php` (also affects `control_project.php` and `default_user.php`). The `GetSQLValueString` function does not process the value when a type is defined, leading to raw user input being directly injected into the database query.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection due to lack of input sanitization
*   **Impact:** Attackers can obtain sensitive database information.
*  **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `sort` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to make HTTP requests to the application with a crafted `sort` parameter.

**[2] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper filtering of the `csa_to_user` parameter in `default_task_edituser.php`. The value is directly inserted into a database query without proper sanitization after a basic role check.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can obtain sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By sending a POST request with a crafted `csa_to_user` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to make HTTP POST requests to the application with a crafted `csa_to_user` parameter.

**[3] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*  **Root Cause**: Improper filtering of the `date` parameter in `log_edit.php`. The `logdate` variable directly enters the database query without processing by the `GetSQLValueString` function.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can obtain sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By manipulating the `date` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to make HTTP requests to the application with a crafted `date` parameter.

**[4] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `user_edit_password.php` file allows modification of any user's password by specifying the `ID` parameter without verifying the current password.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Missing authentication and authorization controls for password modification.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can modify the password of any user in the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a POST request to `user_edit_password.php` with a crafted ID.
*  **Required Capabilities**: Being logged into the application and having knowledge of the user ID to target

**[5] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `user_edit_password.php` file is vulnerable to CSRF, allowing an attacker to force a logged-in user to change their password without their consent.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can change a user's password if they can trick the user into visiting a crafted page.
*   **Attack Vector:** By tricking a logged-in user to open a malicious HTML page that submits a password change request.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to host an HTML page and trick a logged-in user to visit the malicious HTML page.

**[6] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `default_user_edit.php` file does not correctly validate the user ID being modified. While it checks if the current user matches the UID in the query parameter for viewing, it uses `$_POST['ID']` when updating user data, allowing modification of any user's profile.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Inadequate authorization checks when updating user profiles.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can modify the information of any user, including elevating their own privileges to admin.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a POST request to `default_user_edit.php` with a crafted `ID` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Being logged into the application and having knowledge of the user ID to target.

**[7] Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `if_get_addbook.php` file lacks proper authentication and authorization checks, allowing access to all user information via a crafted POST request. The `check_token` function returns the ID of all users.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Missing authentication and authorization.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can obtain usernames and other information of all users in the system.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By sending a POST request to `if_get_addbook.php` with a specific JSON payload.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make HTTP POST requests to the application.

**[8] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `default_task_add.php` file allows specifying the task creator by the `csa_create_user` parameter. This allows a non-admin user to forge a task as being created by the admin (user ID 1).
*   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input sanitization and authorization checks for task creation.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can create tasks on behalf of other users, including the administrator.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a POST request to `default_task_add.php` with a crafted `csa_create_user` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make HTTP POST requests to the application.

**[9] Website Physical Path Leakage**
* **Root Cause:** Source code files reveal the application's physical file path.
* **Weakness**: Sensitive information disclosure
* **Impact:**  Attackers could potentially use this path to conduct further attacks if other vulnerabilities are found
* **Attack Vector:**  By directly accessing the identified source code files.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the application.
