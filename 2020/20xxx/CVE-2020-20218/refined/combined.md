[Update 2021/05/04] Two CVEs have been assigned to these vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-20221: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers
from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the
/nova/bin/cerm process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial
of Service due to overloading the systems CPU.

CVE-2020-20218: Mikrotik RouterOs 6.44.6 (long-term tree) suffers from a
memory corruption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/traceroute process. An
authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due via the
loop counter variable.

Advisory: two vulnerabilities found in MikroTik's RouterOS

Details
=======

Product: MikroTik's RouterOS
Affected Versions: until stable 6.45.7 (first vulnerability), until stable
6.46.4 (second vulnerability)
Fixed Versions: stable 6.46.x (first vulnerability), stable 6.46.5 (second
vulnerability)
Vendor URL: <https://mikrotik.com/>
Vendor Status: fixed version released
CVE: -
Credit: Qian Chen(@cq674350529) of Qihoo 360 Nirvan Team

Product Description
==================

RouterOS is the operating system used on the MikroTik's devices, such as
switch, router and access point.

Description of vulnerabilities
==========================

These two vulnerabilities were tested only against the MikroTik RouterOS
stable release tree when found. Maybe other release trees also suffer from
these vulnerabilities.

1. The cerm process suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption
issue. By sending a crafted packet, an authenticated remote user can cause
a high cpu load, which may make the device respond slowly or unable to
respond.

2. The traceroute process suffers from a memory corruption issue. By
sending a crafted packet, an authenticated remote user can crash the
traceroute process due to invalid memory access.

Solution
========

Upgrade to the corresponding latest RouterOS tree version.
