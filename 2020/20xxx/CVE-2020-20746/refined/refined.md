Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function within the Tenda AC9 router's httpd server. The function uses `sscanf` to directly parse user-supplied content from a POST request into a stack variable without proper bounds checking.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sscanf` function is used to parse the 'list' parameter from the HTTP POST request into stack memory, without validating the size of the input against the size of the allocated buffer.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `fromSetRouteStatic` function does not properly validate the length of the input received, making it susceptible to a buffer overflow.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Attackers can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the device.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Overflowing the buffer can lead to the httpd server crashing.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** A malicious POST request is sent to the `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint with an overly long "list" parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Tenda router to send the crafted POST request. This could be either LAN or WAN access, depending on the router's configuration.
    *   **Authentication:**  The provided exploit code includes a cookie for authentication (`Cookie: uid=8jDWUkDgwn; bLanguage=cn; password=c90fac92f628e1c0f7df4dfc8175cbb0ljbtgb`) suggesting that an attacker may need to authenticate to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided exploit details specifically mentions versions `<= V15.03.06.60_EN` for the Tenda AC9 (Hardware version 3) and `V15.03.05.19(9061)_EN` for the AC15, suggesting a possible vulnerability within multiple Tenda products/firmware versions.
* The exploit provides a sample HTTP POST request demonstrating how to trigger the overflow by appending a long string of "a" characters to the `list` parameter.
