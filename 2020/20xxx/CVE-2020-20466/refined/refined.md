The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in White Shark System(wss) 1.3.2, and does not correlate to a specific CVE. The vulnerabilities are:

**[1] SQL Injection Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `control_task.php`, `control_project.php`, and `default_user.php` files fail to properly sanitize the `sort` parameter before using it in a database query. Specifically, the `GetSQLValueString` function does not process the data when a type is defined, leading to unsanitized data entering the query.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive database information.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `sort` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[2] SQL Injection Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `default_task_edituser.php` file does not sanitize the `csa_to_user` parameter from the POST request, before using it in a database query.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive database information.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious `csa_to_user` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[3] SQL Injection Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `log_edit.php` file does not sanitize the `date` parameter before using it in a database query. Specifically, the `logdate` variable enters the database query without being processed by the `GetSQLValueString` function.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive database information.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `date` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[4] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `user_edit_password.php` file allows users to modify other users' passwords without verifying the original password.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthorized Access.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify the password of any user.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with the target user's `ID` and the new password.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application.

**[5] CSRF Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `user_edit_password.php` file is vulnerable to CSRF because it lacks proper token protection.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can trick a logged-in user into modifying their password by visiting a crafted web page.
*   **Attack vector:**  The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page which submits a password change request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to visit a malicious webpage.

**[6] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `default_user_edit.php` file uses the `ID` parameter from the POST request, rather than the session user ID, to determine which user to modify, allowing users to modify other users' information.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthorized Access.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify information of other users, including escalating their own privileges by changing the `tk_user_rank` parameter.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with the target user's `ID` and modified data.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application.

**[7] Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `if_get_addbook.php` file does not properly authenticate requests and reveals information for all users due to predictable token.
*   **Vulnerability:** Sensitive Information Disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can obtain username information for all users of the current site.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to the `if_get_addbook.php` file with the token set to 0.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[8] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** The `default_task_add.php` file allows attackers to specify the creator of the task via the `csa_create_user` parameter, and set this value to the admin user's ID.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthorized Access.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can forge tasks for admin users.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to the `default_task_add.php` with a crafted `csa_create_user` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[9] Website Physical Path Leakage**
*   **Root cause:** The provided screenshots show several files that leak the server's physical path through PHP errors.
*   **Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
*   **Impact:** The server's physical path is revealed, which can aid in further attacks.
*   **Attack vector:** Accessing the vulnerable files which trigger an error, resulting in path disclosure.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
