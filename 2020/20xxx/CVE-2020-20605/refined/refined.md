The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blog CMS V1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user input in the comment functionality before rendering it on the page. Specifically, the `CommentAdminController.java` does not filter or escape the content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the comments. When other users view the comments, the injected script will execute in their browsers, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious script via the comment form in the administrative backend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access and submit comments via the comment management interface. This could be someone with access to the admin panel.
