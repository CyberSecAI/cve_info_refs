- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "snippets title" field within the `admin/snippets.php` file. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize the input before storing it in the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "snippets title," which gets executed when an administrator visits the `admin/snippets.php` page. This can lead to various attacks including, but not limited to, session hijacking, cookie stealing, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface of the GetSimpleCMS application, specifically by injecting malicious code into the title of a snippet via the `admin/snippets.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to access the admin panel of the GetSimpleCMS application. This typically implies having legitimate user privileges or exploiting another vulnerability to gain access.
