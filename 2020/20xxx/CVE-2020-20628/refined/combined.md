# Unauthenticated stored XSS and content spoofing vulnerabilities in WordPress WP GDPR plugin (unpatched).

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [April 23, 2020 - 10:54am [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:25pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/unauthenticated-stored-xss-and-content-spoofing-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-wp-gdpr-plugin-unpatched/)

> This plugin is not maintained any longer and the vulnerability has never been fixed. Make sure to follow the recommendations below.

The WordPress [WP GDPR plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gdpr-core/), which has 6,000+ active installations, is prone to multiple vulnerabilities affecting version 2.1.1 and below.

Improper access control and unvalidated user input can lead to:

* Stored XSS: An unauthenticated attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be triggered when someone accesses a page or post that has a comment form:![](../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wp-gdpr-core-stored-xss-vulnerability.png)

* Content Spoofing: An unauthenticated attacker can gain full control over the WordPress `comments` table in the database and can tamper with any of its 14 fields: change the content of all comments, assign them to another user or to another post, bypass moderation/approval etc.

* Additional issue: An unauthenticated attacker can delete any comment as well as modify the plugin’s settings.

Because all issues are unfixed we won’t provide more details.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the wordpress.org team on October 22, 2019 and the plugin was removed from the repo.

### Recommendations

**We recommend to uninstall this plugin as there isn’t any security patch available.** If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability since October 2019.
