The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the WordPress WP GDPR plugin, specifically version 2.1.1 and below.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper access control and unvalidated user input within the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to manipulate data and inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Unauthenticated attackers can inject JavaScript code into the comment forms. This code executes when a user accesses a page or post with the affected comment form.
*   **Content Spoofing:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain full control over the WordPress `comments` table, enabling them to modify any of its 14 fields. This includes changing comment content, reassigning comments to different users or posts, and bypassing moderation.
*   **Comment Deletion & Settings Modification:** Unauthenticated attackers can delete any comment and modify the plugin's settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the site, potentially leading to user compromise, data theft, or site defacement.
*   **Content Spoofing:** Modification of content, potentially leading to misinformation, defacement, or manipulation of user perception.
*   **Comment Deletion & Settings Modification:** Deletion of potentially important content and potential disruption of the plugin's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the WordPress comment functionality, where the plugin fails to properly validate user input and enforce access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker requires no authentication. They can inject malicious payloads via the comment functionality without needing any specific permissions.
