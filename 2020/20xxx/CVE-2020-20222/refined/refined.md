Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue within the `sniffer` process of MikroTik's RouterOS. Specifically, a crafted packet triggers a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to a NULL pointer dereference.
- Lack of proper input validation or handling of specific packet types in the `sniffer` process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The sniffer process crashes leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated remote user.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted packet to the RouterOS device.
- The crash manifests as a signal 11, indicating a segmentation fault, specifically due to a NULL pointer dereference.
- The provided crash dump for stable version 6.46.5 of RouterOS shows the following registers: `eip=0x08050e33, eax=0x00000000` indicating the instruction pointer attempted to dereference a NULL address.
- The vulnerability was initially found in long-term version 6.44.6 and it seems that the latest stable version 6.48.2 was still affected.
