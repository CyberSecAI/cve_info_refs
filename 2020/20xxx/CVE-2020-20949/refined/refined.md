{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of PKCS#1 v1.5 padding in RSA encryption/decryption implementations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The PKCS#1 v1.5 padding scheme is vulnerable to Bleichenbacher's padding oracle attack.",
      "The RSA implementation leaks information about the success or failure of the padding operation, allowing an attacker to perform chosen ciphertext attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can decrypt RSA encrypted messages without knowing the private key by using the vulnerable server as a padding oracle.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker intercepts a ciphertext.",
        "The attacker sends crafted ciphertexts to the vulnerable server acting as a padding oracle, analyzing the server's response to determine if the crafted ciphertext is PKCS conforming or not."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send chosen ciphertexts to the vulnerable server and observe whether the padding of the decrypted message is correct or not. The attacker also needs to be able to perform multiple queries."
