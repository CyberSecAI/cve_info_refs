Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `memtest` process in MikroTik RouterOS has an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the `memtest` process lacks proper limits or validation on the amount of resources it uses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High CPU Load:**  A crafted packet can cause the `memtest` process to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a slow or unresponsive device.
- **Memory Exhaustion:**  On x86 RouterOS VMs, the vulnerability can lead to memory exhaustion, ultimately causing the system to reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Packet:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the device.
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, as long as the attacker has network connectivity to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was initially found in MikroTik RouterOS stable version 6.46.3 and was fixed in version 6.47.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) was created that demonstrates the high CPU load. In x86 RouterOS VM environment, the POC can cause the VM to reboot due to memory exhaustion.
