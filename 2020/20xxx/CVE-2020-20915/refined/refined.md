Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `execSql` function within `com.publiccms.controller.admin.sys.SysSiteAdminController`. The function takes a user-controlled `sql` parameter and directly uses it in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. The vulnerability is further exposed by the use of `${sql}` in `SqlMapper.xml`. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization and the direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries through string concatenation using `${}` within the `SqlMapper.xml` file.
*   **Lack of Parameterization:** The code doesn't use parameterized queries, which would prevent SQL injection by treating user inputs as data rather than code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Dump:** The attacker can dump the entire database, including sensitive information.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system.
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute any SQL command on the underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through an HTTP POST request to the `/publiccms/admin/sysSite/execSql.do` endpoint, with the malicious SQL code injected into the `sql` parameter.
*  **Direct URL manipulation:** The content describes that the url parameter `navTabId` can also be manipulated for attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft malicious queries.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The code snippet shows how the `sql` parameter is extracted and used in `sqlService` methods (`update`, `insert`, `delete`, `select`).
*   The `SqlMapper.xml` file reveals that the parameter is directly injected into the SQL query using `${sql}`.
*   The issue author successfully used `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability and dump database information.
*   The suggested fix involves using `#{}`, which would allow the database driver to treat the supplied value as a parameter rather than part of the SQL query.
