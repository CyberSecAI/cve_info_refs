The provided content relates to CVE-2020-20402.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows access to the `/admin` page using a GET request, bypassing password validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: The application does not properly restrict access to administrative pages.
- Improper use of HTTP methods: The application allows access to sensitive pages via GET requests, which are typically used for retrieving data rather than submitting sensitive information or performing actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the admin panel: An attacker can gain access to the administrative page, potentially allowing them to manage the system, modify content, or perform other administrative tasks.
- Complete control over the application: Depending on the functionality available within the admin panel, an attacker could take complete control over the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending an HTTP GET request directly to the `/admin/setup.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the URL to the vulnerable `/admin/setup.php` resource.
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
