Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack exhaustion issue within the `/nova/bin/net` process of MikroTik RouterOS. This is caused by recursive function calls triggered by a crafted packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack exhaustion due to uncontrolled recursion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to the overloading of the system's CPU, potentially crashing the `/nova/bin/net` process, and in some cases, causing a complete system reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted network packets sent to the `/nova/bin/net` process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated remote access to the RouterOS device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was initially found in RouterOS long-term tree version 6.44.5.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit on an x86 RouterOS VM resulted in a system reboot, indicating the severity of the issue.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in stable version 6.47.

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2020-20213, which states it's a stack exhaustion vulnerability in the `/nova/bin/net` process that can lead to a Denial of Service.
