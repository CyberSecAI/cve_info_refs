Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the reported vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Pbootcms application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when storing and displaying data within its administrative interface. Specifically, the `mcode` parameter in the URL can be manipulated to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-controlled input before storing it in the database or displaying it in the web page.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the system (likely database) and then executed when a user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This enables various malicious actions, including:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens to impersonate the user.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data within the application or the user's browser.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - **Malware Delivery:** Redirecting the user to websites containing malicious content.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page to mislead the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `mcode` parameter, containing the malicious JavaScript code.
- **Admin Panel:** The attacker must have access to the admin panel to insert the malicious code via the vulnerable input field.
- **Targeted Page Access:** Once the malicious script is stored, it is triggered when a user (usually another admin) visits the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs access to the administrative interface of the Pbootcms application.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:**  The attacker must be able to construct the malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter (`mcode`) to inject the script.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The content provides a step-by-step process to reproduce the vulnerability:
    1. Access the admin page
    2. Access a specific URL with a vulnerable `mcode` parameter to inject the XSS payload
    3. Access a public facing page to trigger the XSS.
- It includes screenshots that demonstrate how to trigger the XSS payload.
- It also shows that the malicious script is stored.
