The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the WordPress Lara Google Analytics plugin, specifically versions 2.0.4 and below.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `lrgawidget_callback` function which is called via the WordPress AJAX API. The function does not sanitize the `property_id` field from the `$_POST` data before saving it to the database using `update_option`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `property_id` field. This code is then executed within the context of the website, on all pages and posts. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions including but not limited to: redirection to malicious websites, session hijacking, defacement, or other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker uses the `lrgawidget_setProfileID` action via WordPress AJAX API to call the vulnerable function `lrgawidget_callback`. The attack involves sending a crafted POST request including malicious JavaScript code in the `property_id` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the WordPress site, such as a subscriber account, in order to make the necessary authenticated requests.
