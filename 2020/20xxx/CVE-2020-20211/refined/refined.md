Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/nova/bin/console` process of MikroTik RouterOS.
*   It is caused by an assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Assertion Failure:** A reachable assertion exists in the console process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can crash the console process, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Packet:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted packet to the vulnerable console process.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the MikroTik RouterOS.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in MikroTik RouterOS versions up to 6.46.5 (stable release tree)
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a `WinboxMessage` to trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted message with command `0xfe0005` and adding `0xfe0001` with value `0`.

```
    WinboxMessage msg;
    msg.set_to(48, 4);
    msg.set_command(0xfe0005);
    msg.add_u32(0xfe0001, 0);
```

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was initially reported in 2019, and retested in 2020 against the stable 6.46.5 version showing it was not fixed.
*   The issue was fixed in version 6.44.6 (Long-term release tree) as noted in one of the updates in the thread, but this information may be inaccurate as it is later stated that version 6.46.5 still suffers from the vulnerability.
