The provided content relates to CVE-2020-20413.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `checktitle()` function in `/coreframe/app/content/admin/content.php` of WUZHICMS v4.1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection. The `$title` variable, which is user-controlled, is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query. Although the `remove_xss()` function is used to filter out some characters, it can be bypassed using time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `checktitle()` function
- Insufficient input sanitization of the `title` parameter
- Bypassing attempts to filter SQL injection characters using `remove_xss()`

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database or potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries. The provided example shows how to extract the MySQL username.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request with a crafted `title` parameter
- Injection point is located in the `/coreframe/app/content/admin/content.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint and inject a malicious title parameter.
- Knowledge of SQL and time-based blind SQL injection techniques
