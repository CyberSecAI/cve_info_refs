The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MetInfo CMS version 7.0.0 beta.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `doAddColumn` function within `MetInfo7.0.0beta\app\system\column\admin\index.class.php`. The function takes user-supplied input via `$_M['form']['name']` and stores it in the database without proper sanitization. Specifically the `name` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application stores unsanitized user-provided input, leading to XSS when the data is retrieved and displayed.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize the `name` parameter before storing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected content.
- This could lead to session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing unauthorized actions within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/Metinfo/admin/?n=column&c=index&a=doAddColumn` endpoint.
- The malicious payload is placed within the `name` parameter of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `/Metinfo/admin/` interface and perform POST requests to `/Metinfo/admin/?n=column&c=index&a=doAddColumn`.
- It is implied from the description that the attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user to perform this request, given the nature of the vulnerable endpoint.
