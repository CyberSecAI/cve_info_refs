Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `form_addmenu` case within the `function.php` file of S-CMS v1.0. Specifically, the code directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `F_id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows for SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `F_id` parameter.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, configuration details, and potentially other application data.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Through the injection, the attacker could modify or delete data within the database, potentially disrupting application functionality and/or cause data loss.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** In some scenarios, SQL injection can be leveraged to execute operating system level commands on the underlying server, potentially leading to a full system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious `F_id` parameter.
    *  The exploit uses the `addmenu` action and `form` type.
    * The request can also be sent using a GET method.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable S-CMS application.
    *   The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
    * The vulnerable code is located in `4.edu.php\conn\function.php`.
    * The specific line of code where injection occurs is:
        ```sql
        mysqli_query($conn,"insert into ".TABLE."menu(U_title,U_entitle,U_order,U_sub,U_ico,U_type,U_typeid) values('".$F_title."','".$F_entitle."',".($U_order+1).",0,'bars','form',".$_REQUEST["F_id"].")");
        ```
    *   The exploit can use time-based blind SQL injection by using `sleep` function.
    *   The code attempts to filter out spaces, hyphens and asterisks, but can be bypassed by using parentheses.

This information is consistent with a standard SQL injection vulnerability.
