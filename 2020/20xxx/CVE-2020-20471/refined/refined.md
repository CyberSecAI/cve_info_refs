The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in White Shark System(wss) version 1.3.2. This content provides more details than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**[1] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `sort` parameter in `control_task.php`, `control_project.php`, and `default_user.php` files.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection due to direct insertion of user-controlled data into a database query. The `GetSQLValueString` function does not sanitize the input when the type is defined.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can extract sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious `sort` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[2] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `csa_to_user` parameter in the `default_task_edituser.php` file.
*  **Vulnerability:** SQL injection due to direct insertion of user-controlled POST data into a database query.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can extract sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious `csa_to_user` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[3] SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `date` parameter in the `log_edit.php` file.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection due to direct insertion of user-controlled data into a database query. The data is not processed by the `GetSQLValueString` function.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can extract sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious `date` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[4] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `user_edit_password.php` file allows password modification based on the `ID` parameter without verifying the current password of the user being modified.
*   **Vulnerability:** Ability to change any user's password without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify the password of any user, including administrators.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a target `ID` and new password values.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, and have access to an authenticated session.

**[5] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `user_edit_password.php` file lacks CSRF protection, allowing malicious requests to be triggered by a victim's browser.
*   **Vulnerability:** Ability to modify a user's password through a CSRF attack.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can force a logged-in user to change their password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page that sends a crafted POST request to `user_edit_password.php`.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page.

**[6] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `default_user_edit.php` file uses the `ID` parameter from the POST data to update user information without proper authorization checks.
*  **Vulnerability:** Ability to modify any user's information, including their rank, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify any user's details and escalate their privileges to admin.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a target `ID` and modified user details.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, and have access to an authenticated session.

**[7] Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `if_get_addbook.php` file lacks proper authentication and authorization checks and the `check_token` function returns the uid of all users when the token is 0.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthorized retrieval of all users' information.
*  **Impact:** Remote attackers can obtain the usernames and other details of all users on the current site.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with the token parameter set to 0 to `if_get_addbook.php`.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**[8] Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `default_task_add.php` file allows specifying the task creator using `$_POST[‘csa_create_user’]` without proper authorization.
*   **Vulnerability:** Ability to create tasks as another user, including the administrator.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can forge tasks created by any user including admin.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with a forged `csa_create_user` value to `default_task_add.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, and have access to an authenticated session.

**[9] Web Site Physical Path Leakage Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  Multiple files (`control_file.php`, `control_log.php`, `control_project.php`, `control_task.php`, `tree.php`) display the full server path in error messages.
*   **Vulnerability:** Disclosure of server's physical path through error messages.
*   **Impact:**  Remote attackers can gain information about the server's directory structure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering an error in the mentioned files.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and trigger errors.

In summary, the provided content details numerous vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, unauthorized access, CSRF, and sensitive information disclosure. These issues stem from lack of input validation and authorization checks within the application.
