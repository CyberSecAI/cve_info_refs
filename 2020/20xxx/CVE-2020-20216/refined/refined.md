Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-20216:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue within the `/nova/bin/graphing` process of MikroTik's RouterOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** The graphing process crashes due to a NULL pointer dereference, triggered by a specially crafted packet. This indicates a flaw in how the process handles certain input, leading to the use of an invalid memory address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the crashing of the `graphing` process. This can disrupt the normal operation of the MikroTik device, as the graphing process is likely responsible for collecting and displaying network statistics and related data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the MikroTik device to send the crafted packet, this implies that the vulnerability requires some level of access to the device and is not a remotely exploitable vulnerability without any prior access
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the MikroTik device to transmit the malicious packet.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in RouterOS 6.44.6 (long-term tree).
- It was fixed in stable version 6.47.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to a memory corruption issue which is caused by sending a crafted packet, leading to a null pointer dereference.
