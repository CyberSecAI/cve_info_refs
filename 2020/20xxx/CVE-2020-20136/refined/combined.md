## Description

![@raj-kumar-j](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53171147?v=4&size=48)[raj-kumar-j](https://github.com/raj-kumar-j)opened [on Aug 25, 2019](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/3537#issue-484910716)
#### Expected Behavior

The application should not deserialize untrusted data which is user controllable without proper checks and validation of incoming types.

#### Actual Behavior

While deserializing a string, the deserializer is able to invoke unsafe classes that can execute OS commands due to insecure configuration of **TypeNameHandling** property in **JsonSerializerSettings**, which is currently set to **All** from version **2.3.0.0** to **2.4.0.1**. The vulnerable code is in **Common/Data/BaseData.cs line 343**.

#### Potential Solution

1. While deserializing untrusted data. DO NOT use any TypeNameHandling other than None. (**Highly Recommended**)
2. If TypeNameHandling other than None is required, then use a **SerializationBinder** to **validate and whitelist the incoming types**.

#### Reproducing the Problem

1. After opening the solution in visual studio, write the below lines of code in any class that inherits from BaseData class. I have written below code in BasicTemplateAlgorithm.cs.

// string containing exploit code. The string source can be data from remote data server or local file.

string server\_data = "{"$type":"System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider,PresentationFramework","MethodName":"Start","MethodParameters":{"$type":"System.Collections.ArrayList,mscorlib","$values":["calc"]},"ObjectInstance":{"$type":"System.Diagnostics.Process,System"}}";

// Call the DeserializeMessage method in BaseData by passing string, which will try to deserialize the string to an object.

object obj = BaseData.DeserializeMessage(server\_data);

2. Rebuild and run the solution. The calculator program will pop up. I have a video POC. Please request in case required
