   Most apple cider vinegar (ACV) detox users, however, recommend a lot more. Anyone taking drugs or supplements should see their doctor before starting an ACV cleanse. This drink is another popular detox cure for passing drug tests after THC usage. After all, it is cheap, tasty, and convenient to have on hand at any time. It will not entirely eradicate THC from your system, but it will hide THC and increase your chances of passing a urine test by adding vitamins and creatinine to your pee. Also, abstain from alcohol for a brief amount of time while performing this detox, as it does not mix well with beer, wine, or whatever alcoholic beverages you choose. Two tablespoons in one glass of water three times a day is an ideal dosage for the apple cider vinegar detox technique. It is made with only a few simple ingredients, has no added sugar, and has a cocktail-like texture. Since it is acidic by nature, you should keep in mind that it can cause irritation to the throat and stomach. Half-fill a medium-sized glass with ice. Combine water, cranberry juice, and apple cider vinegar in a large mixing bowl. It can, on the contrary, boost THC levels in your body. So, if you have smoked pot and consumed some alcohol, your THC levels will probably be higher than with marijuana alone. A: Yes, you can detox while you are pregnant. In this situation, detoxing is not just for passing a drug test, but because the toxins are detrimental for your fetus. Of course, you should do so strictly under the supervision of your doctor, who may recommend detox products suitable for you.
