The provided content describes vulnerabilities in the WordPress GDPR Cookie Consent plugin, specifically versions 1.8.2 and below.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's `cli_policy_generator` AJAX action, which lacks proper capability checks and nonce verification. This allows authenticated users, even those with low privileges like subscribers, to call specific functions (`autosave_contant_data` and `save_contentdata`) that should be restricted to administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Missing Capability Checks:** The AJAX action `cli_policy_generator` does not check if the user has the necessary privileges to perform the requested actions.
2.  **Missing Nonce Verification:** Although a nonce is sent with the AJAX request, it is not verified on the server-side, allowing for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if the attacker can get a valid nonce.
3.  **Authenticated Stored XSS:** The `autosave_contant_data` method saves user-provided data directly into the `cli_pg_content_data` database field without validation, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
4.  **Privilege Escalation:** The `save_contentdata` method allows modification of existing pages, including changing post status to "draft," which can be used to take the whole site offline, delete or change content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can change the status of any page, deleting or changing content.
2.  **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users visiting the cookie preview page.
3.  **Denial of Service:** Attackers can take pages offline or make the whole website unavailable by setting all pages status to "draft" with the `save_contentdata` method.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **AJAX Calls:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by making AJAX calls to the `wp_ajax_cli_policy_generator` endpoint with specific `cli_policy_generator_action` values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress website to exploit the vulnerability (even a subscriber account is enough).
2.  **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
