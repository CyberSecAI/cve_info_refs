- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerability exists in the product review functionality of imcat v5.2. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. The `fm[auser]` parameter in the product review submission is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other unauthorized actions on the database. The provided examples show the ability to extract the database user, database directory, and database name.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests to the `add_coms.php` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `fm[auser]` parameter in the request body.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to submit product reviews, which may or may not require authentication. The provided screenshots demonstrate how to inject SQL through the vulnerable parameter.
