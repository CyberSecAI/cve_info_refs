The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in NodCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application allows a user with backend access to input and store arbitrary JavaScript code within the "Address" field in settings. This input is not sanitized and is later rendered on the frontend, leading to the execution of the malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page on the frontend.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize the user-supplied input before storing it in the database.
- Improper output encoding: The application does not properly encode the stored data before rendering it on the page, causing the JavaScript code to be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker could steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and other data from the user's browser.
- Account takeover: An attacker could potentially steal user credentials or session information to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Website defacement: An attacker could alter the appearance and functionality of the website.
- Redirects: Attacker could redirect the victim to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with backend access can insert malicious JavaScript code into the "Address" field of the CMS settings.
- The stored JavaScript code is then executed when other users browse pages displaying this content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the backend of the NodCMS. This could be achieved through compromised credentials, or other vulnerabilities.
