- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when storing and displaying article titles, keywords, descriptions, and content, leading to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected content. This can lead to various malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts malicious JavaScript payloads and inserts them into article titles, keywords, descriptions, and content fields when creating/editing articles. These payloads are then stored on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit articles in the vulnerable application.
