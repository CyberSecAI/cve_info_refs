Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in White Shark System (wss) 1.3.2, as described in the Github repository:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection Vulnerability (control\_task.php, control\_project.php, default\_user.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize the `sort` parameter before using it in a database query. The `GetSQLValueString` function does not properly process the parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Unfiltered user-supplied input directly used in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure (e.g., database user, version).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `sort` parameter via GET request (e.g., `/index.php?sort=1,extractvalue(rand(),concat(0x3a,substring(user(),1,30)))%23`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no authentication required.

2.  **SQL Injection Vulnerability (default\_task\_edituser.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize the `csa_to_user` POST parameter before using it in a database query.
    *   **Weakness:** Unfiltered user-supplied input directly used in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure (e.g., database version).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious `csa_to_user` parameter (e.g., `csa_to_user=1' and 1=(updatexml(1,concat(0x5e24,(select @@version),0x5e24),1))#`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, authentication required (user needs to have access to `default_task_edituser.php`).

3.  **SQL Injection Vulnerability (log\_edit.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Failure to sanitize the `date` parameter before using it in a database query.
    *   **Weakness:** Unfiltered user-supplied input directly used in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure (e.g., database version).
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious `date` parameter (e.g., `/log_edit.php?date=1234/**/and/**/1=(updatexml(1,concat(0x5e24,(select%20@@version),0x5e24),1))--%20-&taskid= 1`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, authentication required (user needs to have access to `log_edit.php`).

4.  **Unauthorized Access Vulnerability (user\_edit\_password.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Missing password verification before modifying a user's password using `$_POST['ID']`.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of authorization check.
    *   **Impact:** Remote attackers can change the password of any user by submitting a request with target user's ID.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `user_edit_password.php` with a valid user ID and new password in the payload.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, authentication required.

5.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability (user\_edit\_password.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application does not implement proper CSRF protection.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of CSRF token.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote attackers can use a crafted HTML page to trick an authenticated user into unintentionally changing their password.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Tricking a logged-in user to load a malicious page containing a crafted form that targets `user_edit_password.php`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Remote attacker, relies on user interaction (victim must load attacker's HTML page while being logged in).

6.  **Unauthorized Access Vulnerability (default\_user\_edit.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application uses `$_POST['ID']` to determine which user is being updated, instead of using the session or the authenticated user ID.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization checks during user data update.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote attackers can modify other user's information, including escalating their own privileges to admin by manipulating  `tk_user_rank` parameter in the post request.
     *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `default_user_edit.php` with a target user ID and modified parameters like `tk_user_rank`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, authentication required.

7.  **Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability (if\_get\_addbook.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `if_get_addbook.php` file does not have proper authentication, and the `check_token` function returns the user id of all users by default.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication and token validation.
    *   **Impact:** Remote attackers can obtain usernames and related details of all users.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending an HTTP POST request to `if_get_addbook.php` with a JSON payload containing a default token value.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no authentication required.

8.  **Unauthorized Access Vulnerability (default\_task\_add.php):**
    *  **Root Cause:** The system uses the value from `$_POST['csa_create_user']` to assign the task dispatcher without proper validation.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of authorization check on task creation.
    *   **Impact:** Remote attackers can forge tasks and assign them to other users, including administrators, by manipulating  `csa_create_user` parameter in the post request.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `default_task_add.php` with `csa_create_user` set to 1 to impersonate an admin user creating the task.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, authentication required.

9.  **Web Site Physical Path Leakage Vulnerability:**
     *   **Root Cause:** The source code of multiple PHP files reveals the physical path of the website.
     *   **Weakness:** Disclosure of sensitive file paths in source code.
     *   **Impact:**  Attackers can use this information to further exploit vulnerabilities.
     *  **Attack Vector:** Reading the source code of files like `/control_file.php`, `/control_log.php`, `/control_project.php`, `/control_task.php`, `/tree.php`
     *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker with access to the source code

**Summary**

The provided content details multiple severe vulnerabilities present in White Shark System 1.3.2, including SQL injection, unauthorized access, CSRF, and sensitive information disclosure. These flaws could allow remote attackers to gain full control of the system, expose sensitive data, and modify user information without proper authentication.
