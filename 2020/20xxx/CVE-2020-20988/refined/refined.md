Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause appears to be a lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the `cost-by-owner.php` script, specifically within the "Expiring Between" parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  User-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML output, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The injected JavaScript code (`<script>alert(1)</script>`) demonstrates that an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the victim's browser session.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL with malicious code injected into the `Expiring Between` parameter.
- The attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL that contains the malicious JavaScript payload and convince a user to visit the URL.
- The attacker can be remote, without requiring any access to the server hosting the vulnerable script.

**Additional notes**
- The provided content contains a proof of concept (POC) demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerable URL is `http://localhost/dm/reporting/domains/cost-by-owner.php`.
- The injection point is the `Expiring Between` parameter.

This information indicates a medium severity reflected XSS vulnerability.
