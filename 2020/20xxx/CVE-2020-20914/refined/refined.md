Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct use of user-supplied input within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `sql` parameter from the HTTP request is directly concatenated into a SQL query string.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input (`sql` parameter) within the SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Dump: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data, including user credentials, system configurations, or other confidential information, by crafting malicious SQL queries.
- Data Modification/Deletion: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `/publiccms/admin/sysSite/execSql.do` endpoint.
- `sql` Parameter: The `sql` parameter within the POST request is the entry point for the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: An attacker needs network access to reach the target web application.
- Authentication: An attacker must authenticate as an admin user, as indicated by `@SessionAttribute SysUser admin`, to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- Knowledge of the application: Basic knowledge of the application's structure is necessary to exploit the vulnerability, as it requires crafting SQL queries that interact with the database.

**Technical Details:**

- Vulnerable Code Location: `com.publiccms.controller.admin.sys.SysSiteAdminController` (execSql method) and `SqlMapper.xml`.
- The `execSql` method takes the `sql` parameter and executes it directly using `sqlService.update(sql)`, `sqlService.insert(sql)`, `sqlService.delete(sql)` and `sqlService.select(sql)`.
- The `SqlMapper.xml` defines the SQL statements where the provided input is directly inserted into the query:
  - `<select id="select" parameterType="String" resultType="map">${sql}</select>`
  - `<insert id="insert" parameterType="String">${sql}</insert>`
  - `<update id="update" parameterType="String">${sql}</update>`
  - `<delete id="delete" parameterType="String">${sql}</delete>`

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was discovered on January 6, 2020.
- The provided content shows usage of sqlmap tool to confirm the vulnerability and extract table information.
- The provided fix suggests using `#{} ` for parameter binding, instead of `${}`, to prevent SQL injection.

This information is consistent with a typical SQL Injection vulnerability, where unsanitized user input allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, and is more descriptive than the official CVE description.
