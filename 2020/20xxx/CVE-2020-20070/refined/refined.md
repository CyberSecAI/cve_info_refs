The provided content describes a vulnerability in the DWSurvey application, which is a **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. This aligns with the information expected for CVE-2020-20070, which is a placeholder for a CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a failure of the XSS filter to properly sanitize user input when viewing survey results.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Reflective XSS vulnerability is present in the `/diaowen/design/qu-multi-fillblank!answers.action` file.
    *   The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation and sanitization when processing the `quItemId` and `surveyId` parameters.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into the application.
    *   Attackers can potentially steal cookies from administrators or other users.
    *   The impact is considered serious, especially when combined with CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability exploitation.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   The attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious script in the `quItemId` or `surveyId` parameters.
    *   A successful attack requires tricking a user into clicking the specially crafted URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript.
    *   The attacker needs to lure a victim user to click the malicious link.
    *   The attacker does not need privileged access to the application.

The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) URL:

`/diaowen/design/qu-multi-fillblank!answers.action?quItemId=2c9790db6c74f25f016c7536aed90022&surveyId=2c9790db6c74f25f016c7"><scr<script>ipt>alert('XSS');</script 200`

This PoC demonstrates how the attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed in the user's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. The injected script is an alert box, but it could be malicious and used to steal cookies or redirect the user.
