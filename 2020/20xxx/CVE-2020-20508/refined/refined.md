```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization in the registration form's email parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reflected XSS"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can lead to login hijacking. By crafting a malicious URL with a specific XSS payload, the attacker can redirect the login form submission to an attacker-controlled server, allowing the attacker to steal user credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a crafted XSS payload within the email parameter of the registration form. The victim is tricked into visiting this malicious link, triggering the XSS vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and distribute it to a victim. The victim has to visit the crafted URL in order for the malicious payload to execute. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, they can simply distribute the malicious URL to unauthenticated users. "
