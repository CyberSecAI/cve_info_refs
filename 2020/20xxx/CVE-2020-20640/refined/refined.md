```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses the value of the Referer header in the user login page without proper sanitization, which is then reflected in the HTML as the value of an input field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the login page, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the user.php endpoint, with a malicious payload in the Referer header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server with a controlled Referer header. The attacker has to trick the victim into visiting the crafted URL."
