- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter within the `article.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- Attack vectors: By crafting malicious SQL queries within the `id` parameter in the URL request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `article.php` endpoint.
