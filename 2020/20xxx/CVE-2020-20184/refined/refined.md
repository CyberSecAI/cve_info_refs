The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the GateOne application, specifically within the SSH plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application executes a command where an argument comes directly from user input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into a system command, allowing the injection of arbitrary commands. Specifically, the 'host' and 'port' parameters of the 'terminal:ssh_get_host_fingerprint' command can be manipulated to execute commands on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the GateOne instance. In the provided example, the attacker executes `cat /etc/passwd` to demonstrate the ability to read sensitive server files.

**Attack vectors:**
- **WebSockets:** The attacker leverages the WebSocket connection of the application to send a crafted 'terminal:ssh_get_host_fingerprint' command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the GateOne instance via a web browser.
- The attacker needs to be able to access and manipulate the WebSocket traffic between the browser and the GateOne server.
- The attacker must be able to send specifically formatted JSON messages via the WebSocket.
