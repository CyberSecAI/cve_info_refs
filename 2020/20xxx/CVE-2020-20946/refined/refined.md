Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities in Qibo CMS v7:

**1. CSRF in Publishing Articles:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms. The application does not validate a token or check the `Referer` header, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery.
*   **Weakness:** Missing CSRF token validation and `Referer` header check.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into publishing arbitrary articles on the website without their knowledge.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/member/post.php?job=postnew&step=post`).
    *   The attacker lures a logged-in user to visit the malicious page (e.g., via a link).
    *   The user's browser automatically submits the form with their session cookies, causing the server to process the request and publish the article.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage and get a logged-in user to visit it.

**2. CSRF to Privilege Escalation:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection, similar to the article posting vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** Missing CSRF protection when editing user roles.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can elevate the privileges of a regular user to an administrator, allowing full control of the website.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that makes a POST request to `/admin/index.php?lfj=member&action=editmember` to change the group ID of a regular user to that of an administrator.
    *   The attacker tricks an administrator into visiting the malicious page while logged in.
    *  The administrator's browser sends the request, changing the targeted user's group to administrator.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage and get an administrator user to visit it. They also need to know the username of the target they want to elevate.

**3. Stored XSS in the Admin Panel:**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate sanitization of user input in the friend link feature.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, specifically the `url` parameter when adding a friend link.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when an administrator views the friend links section, potentially leading to account compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker makes a POST request to `/admin/index.php?lfj=friendlink&action=add`, injecting the payload `"><script>alert(1);</script>` into the `postdb[url]` parameter.
    *   The injected script is stored in the database.
    *   When an administrator views the friend links page, the stored JavaScript code executes within the admin's browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker must be able to log into the admin panel.

**4. Arbitrary File Deletion:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Directory traversal vulnerability through the `baktime` parameter during database backup deletion.
*   **Weakness:** Improper validation of user input in the `baktime` parameter in `/admin/index.php?lfj=mysql&action=del`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete any file on the server that the webserver's user has access to, potentially leading to website defacement or data loss.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker crafts a POST request to `/admin/index.php?lfj=mysql&action=del` with `baktime` parameter set to a file path including directory traversal (e.g., `../test.php`).
    *   The application attempts to delete the file specified, based on the manipulated path.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to log into the admin panel.

In summary, the vulnerabilities detailed are: multiple CSRF vulnerabilities, a stored XSS, and an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability. The lack of input validation and missing security mechanisms are the root causes of these security flaws.
