The provided content relates to CVE-2020-20582.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `ApiAdminDomainSettings.php` file where the `$api` parameter, used in a `curl_exec` call, is taken from user input without sufficient validation or sanitization. Specifically, only `trim` is performed on the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. An attacker can manipulate the `$api` parameter to make the server perform requests to arbitrary URLs, including internal resources or file paths.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate or sanitize the `$api` parameter, allowing for injection of arbitrary URLs and protocols.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** As demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept (PoC), an attacker can use `file:///etc/passwd` to read sensitive files on the server, gaining unauthorized access to system information.
*   **Internal Network Scanning/Access:** An attacker could use this SSRF to scan internal networks, potentially identifying and interacting with services that are not directly exposed to the internet.
*   **Potential for further compromise:** Exploitation could lead to a broader compromise of the system if internal services are vulnerable.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `urlPost` function of the `ApiAdminDomainSettings` controller. Specifically, the `$api` parameter can be controlled by providing a value to `postAddress`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `http://site/index.php?s=/setting/ApiAdminDomainSettings/urlPost`.
*   They must be able to control the `postAddress` parameter, and by extension the `$api` value used in the curl request.
