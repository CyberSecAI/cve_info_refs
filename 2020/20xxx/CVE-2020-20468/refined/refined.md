Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in White Shark System (wss) 1.3.2:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `sort` parameter in `control_task.php`, `control_project.php`, and `default_user.php`. The `GetSQLValueString` function fails to process the parameter when a specific type is set, allowing unsanitized input to be directly inserted into SQL queries.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to database information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `sort` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges required.

**Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `csa_to_user` parameter in `default_task_edituser.php`. The `$_POST['csa_to_user']` value is directly used in a database query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to database information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious `csa_to_user` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges required.

**Vulnerability 3: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `date` parameter in `log_edit.php`. The `logdate` variable is used directly in a database query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to database information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious `date` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges required.

**Vulnerability 4: Unauthorized Access**

*   **Root Cause:** The `user_edit_password.php` file allows password modification for a specified user using `$_POST['ID']` without verifying the original password.
*  **Weakness:** Inadequate access control leading to unauthorized password modification.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify passwords for any user, including administrators.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with the `ID` and new password data.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated attacker can modify any user's password.

**Vulnerability 5: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `user_edit_password.php` file lacks CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests to change user passwords.
*   **Weakness:** Missing CSRF protection.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can trick authenticated users into unintentionally modifying their passwords.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious HTML page that sends a POST request to `user_edit_password.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can exploit this by getting a logged-in user to access a malicious webpage.

**Vulnerability 6: Unauthorized Access (Privilege Escalation)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `default_user_edit.php` file uses `$_POST['ID']` to determine the user to update, even though the user is restricted from viewing the information on line 23 if not the current user or an admin.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate access control during user updates.
*  **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify other users' information or escalate their own privileges by manipulating the `tk_user_rank` parameter when updating their own profile.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `default_user_edit.php` with modified user data.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated attacker can modify any user's information, including the administrator's, and can elevate their own privileges.

**Vulnerability 7: Sensitive Information Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The `if_get_addbook.php` file does not require authentication, and the token check uses a default value of 0, effectively granting access to all user information.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of authentication and broken access control.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can obtain username information for all users of the current site.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `if_get_addbook.php` with the default token value.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no special privileges required.

**Vulnerability 8: Unauthorized Access**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `default_task_add.php` uses the `$_POST['csa_create_user']` to assign the task, allowing for task forgery on other users' behalf.
*  **Weakness:** Improper control when assigning tasks, allowing task forgery.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can create tasks on behalf of other users, including administrators.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with a specific `csa_create_user` parameter to `default_task_add.php`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated attacker can create tasks for any other user.

**Vulnerability 9: Physical Path Leakage**
*   **Root Cause:** The source code reveals the server-side physical path in multiple files (`control_file.php`, `control_log.php`, `control_project.php`, `control_task.php`, and `tree.php`)
*   **Weakness:** Unintentional disclosure of the physical path.
*  **Impact:** Could potentially allow attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities or perform other forms of reconnaissance on the target system.
*  **Attack Vector:** Viewing the source code of the files
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Any user who can access the source code.
