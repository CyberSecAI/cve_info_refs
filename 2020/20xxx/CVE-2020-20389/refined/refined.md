Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin/edit.php` file of GetSimpleCMS. The application allows users to input HTML code through a rich text editor, which is then saved and displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied HTML, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected and executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session data.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the page.
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive user information.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Injecting code that downloads malware onto the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the rich text editor in `admin/edit.php`. An authenticated user with the ability to edit content can inject malicious HTML, including JavaScript, through this editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who has access to the `admin/edit.php` page and the ability to modify content using the rich text editor.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of XSS attacks and be able to craft malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided example payload `"<img src=x onerror=alert(1)> <--xss test"` clearly demonstrates the vulnerability. When this payload is saved and displayed in a page (e.g., index page), the JavaScript code `alert(1)` is executed.
- The vulnerability exists in the latest release (3.4.0a) of GetSimpleCMS at the time of the report, indicating a significant security flaw in the production version of the software.
