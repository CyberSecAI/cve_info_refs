  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization in the `booksave.php` file of the Government station building system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the browser.",

This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious websites, or stealing sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `booksave.php` file. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the `G_title`, `G_name`, or `G_msg` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `booksave.php` endpoint."
