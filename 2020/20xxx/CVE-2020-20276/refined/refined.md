  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `handle_PORT` function of the uftpd FTP server. The vulnerability is caused by using `sprintf` instead of `snprintf` when constructing the IP address string from the input provided in the PORT command. The `sprintf` function does not perform bounds checking, leading to a potential buffer overflow if the input IP address components result in a string longer than the destination buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of `sprintf` without bounds checking when formatting a string, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server if the overflow is carefully crafted. This could result in full compromise of the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted PORT command containing long sequences of digits as IP address components to the uftpd FTP server, causing the vulnerable `sprintf` function in the `handle_PORT` function to write beyond the bounds of the `addr` buffer.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send FTP commands to the vulnerable uftpd server. No authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite.",
        "additional_details": "The fix implemented in commit `0fb2c031ce0ace07cc19cd2cb2143c4b5a63c9dd` changes `sprintf` to `snprintf`, which prevents buffer overflows. The affected code was located in `src/ftpcmd.c`"
