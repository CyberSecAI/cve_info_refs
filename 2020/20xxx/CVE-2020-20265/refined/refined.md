[Update 2021/05/04] Three CVEs have been assigned to these vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-20266: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.47 (stable tree) suffers from a
memory corruption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/dot1x process. An
authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (NULL pointer
dereference).

CVE-2020-20264: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.47 (stable tree) in the
/ram/pckg/advanced-tools/nova/bin/netwatch process. An authenticated remote
attacker can cause a Denial of Service due to a divide by zero error.

CVE-2020-20265: Mikrotik RouterOs before 6.47 (stable tree) suffers from a
memory corruption vulnerability in the /ram/pckg/wireless/nova/bin/wireless
process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service due
via a crafted packet.
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption in the `/ram/pckg/wireless/nova/bin/wireless` process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption leading to invalid memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the `wireless` process.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted packet to the vulnerable process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated remote attacker is required.
