Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the transmission of sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext over a communication channel that can be intercepted by unauthorized parties.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of encryption for sensitive data during transmission. This makes the data vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can intercept and read sensitive information transmitted in cleartext. This could include passwords, API keys, personal data, or other confidential information depending on the context of the transmission.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Exposed credentials can lead to unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or services.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers may modify the intercepted cleartext data if it's part of a protocol that allows it, potentially leading to further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** Attackers intercept the network traffic via tools like Wireshark. This can be done on a shared network like a public Wi-Fi.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can position themselves between the sender and receiver to intercept and potentially modify traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have access to the network path where the cleartext data is being transmitted.
- **Eavesdropping Tools:** The attacker requires network sniffing tools to capture network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
The content does not provide specifics about the type of data or specific communication channels used. It only describes a general issue where a system transmits sensitive data without encryption. The screenshots included in the issue report are not accessible, however, it appears that network requests are captured with network analysis tools such as 'Charles Proxy' or similar.
