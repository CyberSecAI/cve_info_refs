- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The S-CMS enterprise website building system (PHP version) does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the copyright text input box.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability occurs because the system stores user-provided input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the copyright text box. This script is then executed in the browsers of all users who visit the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the website, potentially leading to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the system's administrative interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to log in to the S-CMS backend and modify the copyright text setting. After that, any visitor of the website is impacted.
