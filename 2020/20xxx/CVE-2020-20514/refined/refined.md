The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the maccms10 application, as reported in GitHub issue #76.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to trick an authenticated administrator user into performing unwanted actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   CSRF vulnerability that allows deleting admin accounts.
*   The vulnerability is located in the admin/admin/del endpoint of the application.
*   Lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Deletion of administrator accounts, potentially leading to denial of service because no one can log in
*   Complete compromise of the application's administrative functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing multiple requests that trigger the deletion of admin accounts.
*   The victim (administrator) needs to be logged into the application and open the attacker's HTML page (or a page containing the injected code)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator user into accessing a malicious page containing the exploit.
*   The attacker does not require prior access to the application.
