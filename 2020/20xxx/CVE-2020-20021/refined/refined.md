{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Uncontrolled resource consumption in the SSH daemon.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Uncontrolled resource consumption leading to excessive CPU usage.",
    "Failure to limit unauthenticated connections.",
     "Failure to manage maximum connections effectively."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS), resulting in CPU exhaustion, refusal of new authorized SSH connections (via SIGPIPE signal), and system reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote exploitation via the SSH service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of establishing multiple connections to the SSH service."
