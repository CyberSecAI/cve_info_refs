Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20445:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a division-by-zero error in the `compute_ref_coefs` function located in `libavcodec/lpc.h`, specifically at line 155.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Division by Zero:** The code performs a division operation where the divisor (`err`) can potentially be zero. This is a classic programming error that leads to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The division-by-zero error will likely crash the application, leading to a denial of service. As noted in the DLA and DSA entries, a remote malicious user can trigger this to cause a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input file to FFmpeg. This input file needs to have specific characteristics that force the `err` variable to become zero during the execution of the `compute_ref_coefs` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the ffmpeg application, likely through the command line or by manipulating a file processed by ffmpeg.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided information indicates that the issue is considered a floating-point division by zero, which is not considered a bug by some, however, this can still cause a crash.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ffmpeg version `7:3.2.16-1+deb9u1` for Debian 9 (stretch),  `7:4.1.8-0+deb10u1` for Debian 10 (buster) and `7:4.3.3-0+deb11u1` for Debian 11 (bullseye)
