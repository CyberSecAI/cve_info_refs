The provided content is related to CVE-2020-20726.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in GilaCMS. The vulnerability allows an attacker to add a new administrator account without the knowledge or consent of the legitimate administrator.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability, which is a type of web security vulnerability where an attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions on a web application without their knowledge. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the origin of the request before processing the user creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to create a new administrator account, potentially gaining full control of the GilaCMS application, including the ability to access sensitive data, modify content, and perform other administrative actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page hosted on an attacker-controlled server or delivered via phishing. The malicious page uses JavaScript to craft a POST request that adds a new administrator to GilaCMS while a legitimate user is authenticated to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator user of GilaCMS into opening the malicious HTML page in their browser. The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the GilaCMS application itself, but the targeted user must have a valid active session with the application.
