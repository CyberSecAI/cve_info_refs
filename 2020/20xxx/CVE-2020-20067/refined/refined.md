{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper validation and filtering of uploaded file types.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Lack of file type validation/whitelisting"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g. PHP scripts) to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution and complete compromise of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker exploits the file upload functionality by crafting a request to bypass the file type restriction and upload a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to the file upload functionality and the ability to modify HTTP requests."
