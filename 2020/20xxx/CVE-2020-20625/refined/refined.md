The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Sliced Invoices WordPress plugin, specifically version 3.8.2 and below.

**1. Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:**

*   **Root cause:** The `export_csv_full` function, responsible for exporting invoices and quotes to CSV, is registered via the `admin_init` hook. This function lacks capability checks and security nonce.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Missing capability checks and security nonce.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can export all invoices and quotes, exposing sensitive customer data such as names, addresses, and email addresses.
*  **Attack vector:** Directly accessing the vulnerable function through a crafted POST request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** No authentication needed.

**2. Authenticated SQL Injection and Information Disclosure**

*   **Root cause:** The `duplicate_quote_invoice` function, triggered via the `admin_action_*` hook, does not validate the post type being duplicated. The function also uses an unsanitized `$_GET['post']` parameter directly in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing capability checks, security nonce, and SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied data in the `post_id` variable.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can duplicate any post (including private or draft ones, making them public), and can execute arbitrary SQL queries via SQL injection, potentially leading to data breaches.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafted request to the vulnerable `duplicate_quote_invoice` function, either via `GET` or `POST` with a malicious post ID.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:**  Requires an authenticated user account.

**3. Authenticated Information Disclosure**

*   **Root cause:** The `ajax_search_clients` and `ajax_search_non_clients` functions, are registered via the `wp_ajax_*` hook, and lack capability checks and security nonces.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing capability checks and security nonces in AJAX functions.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can search for invoices and quotes, and retrieve the search results as a JSON string, potentially disclosing information.
*   **Attack vector:**  Crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable search functions.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Requires an authenticated user account.

The blog post also recommends updating the plugin to a version higher than 3.8.2 to fix these vulnerabilities.
