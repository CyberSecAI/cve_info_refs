- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Elementor plugin's Safe Mode feature can be enabled by any authenticated user, including those with low privileges, due to a lack of capability checks in the functions that activate safe mode. The AJAX request to enable safe mode relies on a security nonce accessible to all authenticated users, making it exploitable by low-privileged users.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Privilege escalation: Low-privileged users can enable Safe Mode, a feature intended for administrators.
    - Lack of capability checks: The code that enables Safe Mode does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions.
    - Insecure nonce usage: The nonce used to authenticate the AJAX request is accessible to all logged-in users.
    - Logic flaw: The Safe Mode feature can be enabled by a query string, and this functionality is accessible to unauthenticated users.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Disabling security plugins: Attackers can disable security plugins such as firewalls, antispam, two-factor authentication, and captcha, potentially leaving the website vulnerable.
    - Enabling other attacks: By disabling security measures, attackers can facilitate other attacks such as spamming, brute-force attacks, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in WordPress or Elementor.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Exploitation of the AJAX endpoint with an accessible nonce.
    - Sending a request with a specific query string (`elementor-mode=safe`) to trigger safe mode for unauthenticated users.
    - Tricking the editor to load the safe mode option, then using the ajax request.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Any authenticated user on the WordPress site can trigger the vulnerability using the admin interface or the AJAX request.
    - Unauthenticated users can trigger the vulnerability with the correct query string on a site using a vulnerable version of the plugin.
