Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a division-by-zero error in the `libavcodec/aacpsy.c` file within the FFmpeg library. Specifically, the code attempts to divide by a variable `norm_fac` which can be zero in certain conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Division by Zero:** The core vulnerability is the division by zero, which is a classic programming error that can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. When a malformed media file or stream triggers the division by zero, the FFmpeg process will crash or terminate unexpectedly, preventing it from processing any further media.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Media Files/Streams:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specifically crafted malicious media file or stream that contains data which results in `norm_fac` being zero during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious media file or stream to an application or service that uses the vulnerable version of FFmpeg. This could be through a variety of means, such as:
    *   Uploading a specially crafted file to a web service.
    *   Sending a malicious file as an email attachment.
    *   Providing a stream with malicious data.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   The issue was first reported against git-master version of ffmpeg and was later fixed.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Debian by backporting the fix to the specific versions of the package.
*   A test case file (`tmp.flv`) is available for reproduction.
*   The issue is triggered when transcoding a malformed FLV file using specific output encoding options.
*   The division by zero occurs within the AAC psychoacoustic analysis module (`aacpsy.c`).

**In summary, CVE-2020-20446 is a denial-of-service vulnerability due to a division-by-zero error in the AAC audio decoder within FFmpeg. It can be triggered by processing specially crafted media files, causing the application to crash.**
