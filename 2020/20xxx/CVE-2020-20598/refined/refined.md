Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the application at `http://www.mossle.com/index.do`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **CSRF Vulnerability:** A CSRF vulnerability exists in the backstage area where a component can be added through a POST request to `http://www.mossle.com/portal/save.do`. The application doesn't have proper CSRF protection measures in place, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly adding a component.

2.  **XSS Vulnerability:** There's an XSS vulnerability when editing a component. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. In this case the attacker can set the `portalItemName` parameter to contain javascript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By combining both vulnerabilities, an attacker can:
1.  First, exploit the CSRF vulnerability to inject malicious XSS payload into a component.
2.  Then, when an administrator visits the page displaying the component with injected XSS code, the malicious script will execute in the administrator's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal the administrator's session cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **CSRF Attack:** An attacker constructs a malicious HTML page containing a form that automatically sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`http://www.mossle.com/portal/save.do`) when loaded by a logged-in administrator.
2.  **XSS Attack:** An attacker leverages the XSS vulnerability in the component editing to inject javascript to steal cookies of a victim visiting the page with the injected component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious HTML page and trick an authenticated admin user into accessing it.
2.  The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the parameters needed for the CSRF exploit.
3.  The attacker needs to have knowledge of the XSS vulnerability and inject a malicious javascript to exploit it.

**Additional details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates the specific parameters necessary for the CSRF attack: `portalWidgetId` and `portalItemName`. The `portalItemName` parameter is used to inject the XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('cookie')>`. When a user views this, the javascript will execute, allowing the attacker to steal the user's cookies.
