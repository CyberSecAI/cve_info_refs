The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities found in Qibo CMS v7. Here's a breakdown:

**1. CSRF in publishing articles:**

*   **Root Cause**: Lack of CSRF protection in the article publishing functionality.
*   **Weakness**: The application does not use CSRF tokens or check the referer header, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
*   **Impact**: An attacker can trick a logged-in user into publishing articles without their knowledge. This can be used to deface a website or spread misinformation.
*   **Attack Vector**: Sending a crafted HTML page with a malicious form to a logged-in user. The user visiting the malicious page will trigger the CSRF attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker must be able to host a web page accessible to the victim, and the victim must be logged into the vulnerable Qibo CMS instance.

**2. CSRF to Privilege Escalation (add a super administrator):**

*   **Root Cause**: Lack of CSRF protection in the user editing functionality.
*   **Weakness**: The application does not use CSRF tokens, nor does it validate the referer header when editing user information, allowing an attacker to forge requests.
*  **Impact**: An attacker can promote a regular user to an administrator without the admin's consent. This allows the attacker to fully compromise the Qibo CMS system.
*   **Attack Vector**: Sending a crafted HTML page with a malicious form to a logged-in administrator. The administrator visiting the malicious page will trigger the CSRF attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker must be able to host a web page accessible to the victim, and the victim must be logged into the vulnerable Qibo CMS instance as an administrator.

**3. Stored XSS in the background:**

*   **Root Cause**: Insufficient input sanitization when adding friend links.
*   **Weakness**: The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input when adding a friend link, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the application database.
*   **Impact**: When an administrator views the friend link page, the stored XSS payload will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the admin, or redirect users to other sites.
*   **Attack Vector**: Submitting a form with malicious Javascript in the URL field when adding a new friend link.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities**:  Requires admin privileges to access and add friend links within the Qibo CMS admin panel.

**4. Arbitrary File Deletion in the background:**

*   **Root Cause**: Lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the database backup deletion functionality.
*   **Weakness**: The application doesn't properly validate the `baktime` parameter during database backup deletion, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal to delete arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Impact**: An attacker can delete any files accessible by the webserver user, leading to potential data loss and site malfunction.
*   **Attack Vector**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a path traversal payload in the `baktime` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities**: Requires admin access to the Qibo CMS admin panel to access the database backup deletion function.

**Additional Notes**

* The blog post provides detailed steps to reproduce each vulnerability, including the specific HTTP requests and HTML PoCs
* The combination of CSRF with other vulnerabilities can lead to severe security consequences, such as privilege escalation.
* The identified vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the security and integrity of any website using the affected Qibo CMS version.
