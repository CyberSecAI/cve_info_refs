Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the issues reported in ticket #7990, which appear to be related to CVE-2020-20448 based on the vulnerability descriptions of undefined behavior and division-by-zero:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Undefined Behavior:** The issue stemmed from undefined behavior in `libavcodec/snowenc.c` due to bitwise shift operations.
*   **Division by Zero:** A division-by-zero error existed in `libavcodec/ratecontrol.c`. It was initially reported as a floating-point division by zero, but later clarified that a similar issue was found in integer math.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Undefined Shifts:** The `snowenc` encoder used shift operations that could lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or unpredictable results.
*   **Division by Zero:** The `ratecontrol` module was susceptible to division-by-zero errors. Although the initial report mentioned a floating-point division, the issue also presented in other parts of the codebase. This can lead to crashes or denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crashes:** Both issues (undefined behavior and division by zero) could cause the application using FFmpeg to crash.
*   **Denial of Service:** Repeated crashing of the application can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The shifts could produce unpredictable results, which, depending on the context, may have security implications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The primary attack vector is providing a crafted input file (in this case, an `avi` file) that triggers the vulnerable code paths when processed by FFmpeg.
*   **Specific Encoder Options:** The reporter used specific encoder options that could trigger the bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker would need to be able to provide an input file to the system utilizing FFmpeg.
*   **Understanding of FFmpeg Options:** Some level of understanding of the FFmpeg command-line options and encoders could be needed to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GDB log may have contained more details about the location of the vulnerabilities
*   The issues were addressed in separate commits:
    *   Undefined shifts in `snowenc.c` were fixed by commit `8802e329c8317ca5ceb929df48a23eb0f9e852b2`.
    *   The floating point division by zero in `ratecontrol.c` was fixed by commit `55279d699fa64d8eb1185d8db04ab4ed92e8dea2`.
*   The division by zero was initially suspected as a floating point error, but the final fix also covers integer divisions by zero.
