{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application accepts user input without sanitization and stores it in the database. This user input is later displayed on the website without proper filtering or escaping, allowing execution of injected scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page management section. When other users access the affected page, these scripts are executed within their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "Injecting a malicious script in the 'page management' area.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs the ability to edit content in the 'page management' feature."
