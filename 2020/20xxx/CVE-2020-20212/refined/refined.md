Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-20212:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in the `/nova/bin/console` process of MikroTik RouterOS.
- The root cause is a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Specifically, a NULL pointer dereference occurs due to a crafted packet sent to the console process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can crash the console process, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Exploitation is achieved by sending a crafted packet to the affected device.
- **Remote:**  The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the MikroTik RouterOS device. This indicates that the attacker must have valid credentials to access the router's management interface.

**Technical Details (from provided PoC):**
- The provided PoC shows the crafted WinboxMessage to trigger the vulnerability:
  ```
    WinboxMessage msg;
    msg.set_to(48, 4);
    msg.set_command(0xfe0005);
    msg.add_u32(0xfe000c, -1);
    msg.add_u32(9, 9);
  ```
  This indicates that the vulnerability is triggered by manipulating specific parameters in the Winbox protocol message.

**Affected Versions:**
- MikroTik RouterOS versions up to 6.46.5 (stable release tree) are affected.
- Specifically mentioned is version 6.44.5 (long-term tree).
- It is noted that version 6.44.6 (long-term tree) had the second related vulnerability fixed but not this one.

**Fixed Versions:**
-  The provided text does not state when it was fixed, only that the vendor was notified.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the console process (`/nova/bin/console`).
- The exploit relies on sending a crafted WinboxMessage.
- The vulnerability is related to another vulnerability, CVE-2020-20211, which involves an assertion failure in the same process.
- The vulnerability was initially reported to the vendor in August 2019 and retested in April 2020 against the stable 6.46.5 tree.
