The provided content describes a vulnerability in Pluck-4.7.10.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `trashcan_restoreitem.php` file (line 54) and a similar flaw in "manage images" functionality (line 76) where the filename is improperly constructed when restoring files from the trashcan. Specifically, the code extracts the filename and extension, and appends `_copy` to the filename before concatenating with the extension. This process does not properly sanitize the extension resulting in the possibility of injecting an executable file extension (e.g. php).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper filename handling during file restoration from the trashcan, which allows for the renaming of a file to an executable extension like `.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution. By uploading a file with a double extension like `shell.php.txt`, deleting it to the trash, re-uploading a file of the same name and then restoring from the trash, the file will be renamed to `shell_copy.php`, allowing a malicious actor to execute arbitrary code by accessing the file through the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload functionality in the admin panel followed by file deletion to the trashcan, re-upload of a file with same name and subsequent restoration from the trashcan.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Pluck CMS admin panel with privileges to manage files and images.
- Ability to upload files, delete files and restore from trashcan.
