Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication and integrity protection in USB HID communications between the currency dispenser and the host computer in NCR SelfServ ATMs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The communication channel lacks proper authentication mechanisms, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data without being verified.
*   **Missing Integrity Protection:** The absence of integrity checks means that manipulated data goes undetected by the host.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability leads to a buffer overflow on the host computer due to the manipulated USB HID communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the host computer with SYSTEM privileges, granting them full control over the ATM system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the internal components of the ATM to manipulate the USB communications bus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access to ATM Internals:** The attacker must be able to open the ATM and connect to the internal components, specifically the communication bus between the currency dispenser and the host.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the USB HID protocol to craft and inject malicious data and exploit the buffer overflow on the host.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected software is NCR SelfServ ATMs running APTRA XFS 05.01.00 or older, which was already out of support at the time of the report.
*   This vulnerability is related to CVE-2020-10123, which involves session key manipulation for the dispenser.
*   Mitigation involves software, hardware, firmware, and configuration updates for affected ATMs.
