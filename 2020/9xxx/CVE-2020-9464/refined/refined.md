- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Denial-of-service vulnerability in BECKHOFF Ethernet TCP/IP Bus Coupler BK9000.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The coupler's function can be inhibited, leading to a denial of service. The device will not recover after the attack has stopped and requires a reboot to restore operation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send network traffic to the device. No authentication or user interaction is required, and the attacker doesn't need to be on the same network segment to execute the attack.
