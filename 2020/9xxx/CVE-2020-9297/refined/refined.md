Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators in Netflix Titus.
*   These validators support different types of interpolation, including Java EL expressions when building custom constraint violation error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection:** The core issue is a server-side template injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input used in error message templates.
*   **Unsanitized Input to EL Expression:** Specifically, the `ConstraintValidatorContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate()` method is vulnerable because it allows arbitrary Java EL expressions to be included within the error message template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting arbitrary data containing malicious Java EL expressions into the error message template, an attacker can achieve unauthenticated Remote Code Execution. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Data Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious data into the error message template passed to `ConstraintValidatorContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Data:** The attacker needs the ability to inject arbitrary data into a field or parameter that is used to construct an error message template within the vulnerable application.
*   **Unauthenticated Access**: The vulnerability leads to unauthenticated RCE. This implies that the attacker doesn't need valid credentials to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerability is located in the `titus-control-plane` component of Netflix Titus.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves sanitizing the message string by escaping special characters so that it is not evaluated as an EL expression.
*   **Fixed Version:**  The patched version of Titus is >=v0.1.1-rc.274.
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was identified by the GitHub Security Labs team (@pwntester)
