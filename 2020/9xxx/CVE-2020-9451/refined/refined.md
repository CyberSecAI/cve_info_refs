Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-9451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary root cause is a combination of insecure file handling and a lack of proper access control on a REST API in Acronis True Image 2020's anti-ransomware service.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Denial of Service via Hardlink Manipulation (DoS Issue 1):**
    *   **Weakness:** The `anti_ransomware_service.exe` writes logs to a directory where unprivileged users have write permissions. The log file names are predictable.
    *   **Vulnerability:** An unprivileged user can create a hardlink from a future log file to the `anti_ransomware_service.exe` executable itself. Upon reboot, when the service attempts to write to the log, it will try to write to its own executable, resulting in a sharing violation and crashing the service.
2.  **Denial of Service via Unprotected REST API (DoS Issue 2):**
    *   **Weakness:** The `anti_ransomware_service.exe` exposes a REST API on localhost (port 6109) without any access restrictions.
    *   **Vulnerability:** An unprivileged user can send API calls to this service to disable its functionality. Specifically, they can send PUT requests to `/settings/common` with JSON data to disable various features such as `autoFileRestore`, `backupProtectionEnabled`, `fileProtectionEnabled`, and ultimately `sessionEnabled`, effectively turning off the service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DoS Issue 1:**  The anti-ransomware service crashes on every reboot, leaving the system unprotected. This is a persistent denial of service.
*   **DoS Issue 2:** The anti-ransomware service can be disabled, leaving the system unprotected from ransomware attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DoS Issue 1:** Local attack. An attacker with low-privilege access can create a hard link.
*   **DoS Issue 2:** Local attack. An attacker with low-privilege access can send HTTP requests to the exposed REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local, unprivileged access to the system where Acronis True Image 2020 is installed.
*   For DoS Issue 1, the attacker needs to be able to run the tool to create hard links.
*   For DoS Issue 2, the attacker needs to be able to execute a script or program capable of making HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes**

The provided information gives more technical details than the CVE description. It details the specific API endpoints and the process of creating the hardlink and how this leads to a denial of service on the anti-ransomware service.
