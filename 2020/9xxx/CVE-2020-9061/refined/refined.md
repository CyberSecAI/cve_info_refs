Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-9061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 500 and 700 series chipsets handle routing messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Susceptibility to denial of service through malformed routing messages.
- The weakness is related to both S0 and S2 security implementations within these chipsets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can cause a denial of service on vulnerable devices within Z-Wave radio range.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed routing messages are sent to the Z-Wave devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within Z-Wave radio range of the target devices.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in devices using both S0 and S2 security implementations.
- Silicon Labs acknowledges this as a known weakness related to S0 and S2 security.
- This is one of multiple vulnerabilities found in Z-Wave chipsets via a fuzzing approach called VFuzz.
