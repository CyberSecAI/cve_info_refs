Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9517

**Component:** Micro Focus Service Manager Release Control (versions 9.50 and 9.60)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames within the Release Control component of Micro Focus Service Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is the lack of proper restrictions on how UI layers or frames are rendered. This allows an attacker to potentially manipulate the user interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to UI redress attacks (also known as clickjacking).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker does not need local access to the server.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into interacting with a malicious UI overlay, seemingly part of the legitimate application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into accessing a malicious UI. This can likely be achieved through social engineering or other typical attack methods that lead the user to a malicious site.
- The attacker is classified as requiring low privileges on the target system, and user interaction is needed for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS v3 base score is 5.4, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating a network-based attack, low attack complexity, low privileges required, user interaction required, and a scope change, with low impacts on confidentiality and integrity, and no impact on availability.

- The provided text also mentions a CVSS v2 base score, but the actual value is masked. The vector is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), which shows a network attack vector, medium access complexity, no authentication required, and high impacts on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- A fix is available, and customers are advised to follow the provided link to access the detailed instructions on how to remediate this vulnerability.
