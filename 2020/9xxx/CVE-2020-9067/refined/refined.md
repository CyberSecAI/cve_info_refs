- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in some Huawei products.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the affected devices.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely when the affected product functions as an Optical Line Terminal (OLT).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable OLT device. The attacker could be located on the same network or potentially from a remote location depending on network configurations.
