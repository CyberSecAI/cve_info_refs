# Multiple Vulnerabilities Patched in RegistrationMagic Plugin

On February 24th, our Threat Intelligence team discovered several critical vulnerabilities in [RegistrationMagic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager/), a WordPress plugin installed on over 10,000 sites, *including the vendor’s own site*.

These allowed an attacker with subscriber-level permissions to elevate their account’s privileges to those of an administrator and to export every form on the site, including all the data that had been submitted to them in the past. Additionally, through a number of unprotected AJAX actions, an attacker with subscriber-level permissions could send arbitrary emails, import a custom vulnerable form, replace an existing form with their uploaded form, and use the vulnerable form to register a new administrative user. Finally, none of the administrative functions used by the plugin included nonce checks, making the plugin vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks – it was possible for an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an administrator to update any of the plugin’s settings.

We privately disclosed these issues to the plugin’s author, who released a patch 2 days after receiving our full report. [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20200305&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=intro) users received a new firewall rule on February 25th to protect against exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Free Wordfence users will receive this rule on March 26, 2020.

**Description**: Authenticated Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin**: RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms and User Login

**Plugin Slug**: custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager

**Affected Versions**: <= 4.6.0.3

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2020-9456](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9456)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CVSS Score**: 9.9(Critical)

**Patched Version**: 4.6.0.4

The RegistrationMagic plugin allows WordPress users to create customized registration forms, track registration submissions, manage users, analyze stats and assign user roles, as well as accept payments.

While quite powerful, there are a number of functions in the plugin used for administrative purposes that are not protected by capability checks or nonces, all of which are processed using custom forms generated by the plugin. Additionally, the plugin automatically creates and publishes a page upon activation, accessible to subscribers at /rm\_submissions. This page is intended to allow users to view their previous form submissions, but it could also be used to render and process forms that were only intended to be accessed by administrators. Sending a request to this page with the ‘rm\_slug’ $\_POST parameter set to ‘rm\_user\_edit’ and the ‘user\_id’ parameter set to the user’s ID (which can typically be obtained from the user’s profile page) caused the plugin to generate a form which could be used to change the user’s role to administrator. Unfortunately, this form didn’t use a capability check or a nonce, so it could be used by a subscriber to update their own role to administrator.

```
    public function edit($model, RM_User_Services $service, $request, $params)
    {
        if (isset($request->req['user_id']))
        {
            if ($this->mv_handler->validateForm("rm_edit_user"))
            {
                if (isset($request->req['user_password']) && isset($request->req['user_password_conf']))
                {
                    if ($request->req['user_password'] && $request->req['user_password_conf'] && $request->req['user_id'])
                        $service->reset_user_password($request->req['user_password'], $request->req['user_password_conf'], $request->req['user_id']);
                    $service->set_user_role($request->req['user_id'], $request->req['user_role']);
```

**Description**: CSRF to Settings Modification

**Affected Plugin**: RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms and User Login

**Plugin Slug**: custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager

**Affected Versions**: <= 4.6.0.3

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2020-9454](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9454)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CVSS Score**: 8.0(High)

**Patched Version**: 4.6.0.4

Not only did the RegistrationMagic plugin fail to check nonces in the previously mentioned vulnerability, it actually did not check nonces for *any* of its functionality, including the forms used to save changes to the plugin settings. As such it was possible for an attacker to forge a crafted request on behalf of a site administrator in order to modify the plugin’s settings, which included the ability to delete existing users or add new user roles. It could even be used to allow forms to accept php files, which could then be used to upload a backdoor which could allow an attacker full control over the WordPress site.

**Description**: Authenticated Email Injection

**Affected Plugin**: RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms and User Login

**Plugin Slug**: custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager

**Affected Versions**: <= 4.6.0.3

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2020-9455](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9455)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVSS Score**: 6.4(Medium)

**Patched Version**: 4.6.0.4

In addition to allowing a subscriber to elevate their privileges, the RegistrationMagic plugin also allowed a subscriber to send emails from the site to any email address, with a subject and body of their choice. This could be used to send spam, but this flaw would also make tricking a site  administrator into clicking a link in order to perform a CSRF attack much easier. This functionality actually used an unprotected AJAX action, which is an extremely common attack vector in WordPress. Although it was only available to subscribers, much of the plugin’s functionality was geared towards an improved user experience for subscribers, so this was a surprising oversight.

```
$this->loader->add_action('wp_ajax_send_email_user_view', new RM_User_Services(), 'send_email_ajax');
```
```
    public static function send_email_ajax()
    {
        $to = $_POST['to'];
        $sub = $_POST['sub'];
        $body = $_POST['body'];

        RM_Utilities::quick_email($to, $sub, $body);

        wp_die();
    }
```

As you can see, the ‘send\_email\_ajax’ function doesn’t use any capability or nonce checks, so any logged-in user could use it to send email from the site.

**Description**: Authenticated Settings and User Data Export

**Affected Plugin**: RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms and User Login

**Plugin Slug**: custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager

**Affected Versions**: <= 4.6.0.3

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2020-9458](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9458)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVSS Score**: 4.3(Medium)

**Patched Version**: 4.6.0.4

Using the same /rm\_submissions endpoint as the authenticated privilege escalation vulnerability, a logged-in attacker could also send a request with the ‘rm\_slug’ $\_POST parameter set to ‘rm\_form\_export’, which caused the plugin to export every form on the site, *including everything that had ever been submitted to any of these forms* (though this did not include login credentials). Again, the export function lacked access control or a nonce check, and in addition to exposing potentially sensitive information, an attacker could use the exported form data to launch yet another type of attack. For those sites with sensitive personally identifiable user information, such as commerce sites, this vulnerability was particularly concerning.

\*The vulnerable function has more than 230 lines of code. For brevity,  we’re not showing it here, but it is available to review in [the plugin repository](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager/trunk/admin/controllers/class_rm_form_controller.php?rev=1977925#L232).

**Description**: Authenticated Settings Import -> Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin**: RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms and User Login

**Plugin Slug**: custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager

**Affected Versions**: <= 4.6.0.3

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2020-9457](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9457)

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CVSS Score**: 8.0(High)

**Patched Version**: 4.6.0.4

There was one more method an attacker could use to create an administrator, though it took a bit more work and a few more steps. One of the more advanced features of the RegistrationMagic plugin allowed the creation of forms that saved user-submitted content directly into the usermeta table in the site’s database. While this functionality was intended to store additional metadata about the user, this table is *also* used to store a user’s permissions, using the wp\_user\_level and wp\_capabilities keys, and a custom form could be created to modify the contents of these keys. Another advanced feature was the ability to make forms “expire” after a certain date or number of submissions, and to automatically substitute a different form at that time.

Unfortunately, thanks to more unprotected AJAX actions, an attacker could upload a customized “vulnerable” registration form. They could then use the data export vulnerability to grab the information they needed to launch the next step: by using yet another unprotected AJAX action, they could set an existing form on the site to expire after 0 submissions, and replace it with their newly uploaded form. Once the vulnerable form was active, the attacker could register as an administrator.

If no forms were published, but the plugin’s “Magic Button” functionality was enabled, an attacker could also use an unprotected AJAX action to set their uploaded form as the “Default” form, which could be submitted from anywhere on the site.

The registered AJAX actions:

```
$this->loader->add_action('wp_ajax_rm_save_form_view_sett', new RM_Form_Settings_Controller(), 'view');
```
```
$this->loader->add_action('wp_ajax_set_default_form', 'RM_Utilities', 'set_default_form');
```
```
$this->loader->add_action('wp_ajax_import_first', 'RM_Services', 'import_form_first_ajax');
```
```
$this->loader->add_action('wp_ajax_rm_admin_upload_template', $rm_admin, 'upload_template');
```

The vulnerable functions – note the lack of capability checks and nonce checks:

```
    public function upload_template(){
       if($_FILES){
               $name=get_temp_dir().'RMagic.xml';
               if(is_array($_FILES['file']['tmp_name']))
               $status= move_uploaded_file ( $_FILES['file']['tmp_name']['0'] , $name );
               else
               $status= move_uploaded_file ( $_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $name );
               echo json_encode(array('success'=>$status));
        }
```
```
    public static function import_form_first_ajax() {
        $form_id = null;
        if (isset($_POST['form_id'])) {
            $form_id = $_POST['form_id'];
        }
        echo self::import_form_first(null, $form_id);
        wp_die();
    }
```
```
    function view($model=null, $service=null, $request=null, $params=null) {
        if (!$request instanceof RM_Request) {
            $postdata = file_get_contents("php://input");
            $request = json_decode($postdata);
            if(isset($request->form_id) && (int)$request->form_id){
                $model = new RM_Forms;
                $model->load_from_db($request->form_id);
                $model->set((array)$request);
                $model->update_into_db();
                echo 'saved';
```
```
    public static function set_default_form() {
        if (isset($_POST['rm_def_form_id'])) {
            $gopts = new RM_Options;
            $gopts->set_value_of('default_form_id', $_POST['rm_def_form_id']);
        }
        die;
    }
```

  Wow, I use RegistrationMagic Premium and I've had the latest update for well over a week. I just went to https://metagauss.com/ who is the site that holds the plugins for RegistrationMagic and ProfileGrid. The version to download is still v4.6.0.1.

  RegistrationMagic.com is down or responding very slow and the pages do not display properly. However, ProfileGrid.co comes up as well as metagauss.com. You have me a little worried about reading this post. I'll check again tomorrow to se if a newer version is available.

## Description

#### WordPress User Registration Forms Plugin

Create custom WordPress registration forms, publish signup and login pages, enable user registrations, approve new users, accept payments, track submissions, manage users, analyze registration data, assign user roles, apply registration status, send bulk emails, automate registration process, launch event registration, integrate WooCommerce, and much more. If you are looking for a powerful WordPress user registration plugin and custom registration form builder, look no further than RegistrationMagic!

#### So, what exactly is RegistrationMagic?

[RegistrationMagic](https://registrationmagic.com) will let you take TOTAL CONTROL of user registrations on your site, with its powerful building, configuring, publishing, managing, analyzing and automation toolkit. You can create different WordPress Registration Forms for your users with pre-defined form fields using an intuitive drag-and-drop form builder. Choose from ready-to-use forms library to quickly create your forms with a few simple clicks! You can also set up payments for [paid user registrations](https://registrationmagic.com/setup-payments-on-registrationmagic-form-using-products/) and build any type of WordPress payment form. [A Front-End user registration area](https://registrationmagic.com/how-create-custom-user-area-page-in-wordpress/) allows your users to login, reset password, check payment transaction history, download their form submissions, etc.

[Get started with RegistrationMagic using our Starter Guide.](https://registrationmagic.com/create-wordpress-registration-page-starter-guide/)

RegistrationMagic tracks all incoming registration form submissions and activities, which can be monitored from individual form dashboard, allowing you to make informed decisions about your form tweaks. You can also accept attachments (single or multiple), and view or download them from a single area inside the dashboard. Advanced filters allow you to track form submissions for a specific registration form within a time period.

There is also a full-fledged [User Management module](https://registrationmagic.com/wordpress-user-management-plugin-guide/) integrated with RegistrationMagic. It goes a step ahead of default WordPress User manager by connecting user registration and payment activities with individual user accounts. User Manager is the central hub for RegistrationMagic’s user management system, which provides important information about each user within individual user pages. User management also offers enhanced options like suspending and re-activating users.

RegistrationMagic not only allows you to create [new user roles](https://registrationmagic.com/register-users-specific-role-wordpress-site/) but integrate them with your login and registration system easily. You can even create paid user roles using in-built manager!

Full integration with WordPress’ default user-meta system means you can hook your registration fields with existing user-meta keys, or create new ones right from the comfort of your registration form dashboard. Therefore, not only all registration form submissions are visible inside WordPress User pages as table, you can also go ahead and map individual registration form fields to user profile fields (or create new ones from scratch)! This also opens a world of opportunity for integrations with other plugins using WP user-meta.

[Learn more about RegistrationMagic features here.](https://registrationmagic.com/features/)

Not happy with default WordPress registration page? You can define and replace default WordPress registration page with your own custom-built registration form. RegistrationMagic provides you with more control and flexibility over your WordPress registration page. It redefined the user experience by combining specialized roles of both login and registration plugin.

With RegistrationMagic you can build anything from simple to complex [registration approval system](https://registrationmagic.com/manual-approval-of-registered-users/) to enable or disable user registration. Powerful Custom Status feature offers an option to create multi-step registration approval process. [Automations](https://registrationmagic.com/complete-automation-guide-wordpress-forms/) can be used for [automated registration approval](https://registrationmagic.com/automate-wordpress-user-account-activation-deactivation-deletion/) mechanism. These features allow you to use RegistrationMagic for industry specific registration systems, like [WordPress event registration plugin](https://registrationmagic.com/event-registration-form-plugin/) for online or physical events, member registration plugin for teams, WordPress application form plugin for businesses and WordPress enrollment plugin for sport camps. If you are [registering with limited seats](https://registrationmagic.com/restrict-limit-user-registration-wordpress/), the Limits feature can help you build WordPress event registration form, which has both a booking time window and option to limit the number of bookings. You can also [generate token numbers](https://registrationmagic.com/assign-unique-registration-token-number-to-user/) for every booking for these event registration forms. Another example would be to use it as [WordPress course registration plugin](https://registrationmagic.com/best-wordpress-class-registration-plugin/) for classes.

[Custom Status Guide](https://registrationmagic.com/wordpress-user-registration-status-guide/): The Custom Registration Status system allows combining multiple actions in a single click. (Just like your very own macros!) This enables you to move submissions through a vetting process. Every action can prompt user to fulfill certain requirements. With advance Inbox filters and saved searches, It’s a cinch to sort and mark submissions. Failed registration attempts can be routed through different registration setup.

#### Frontend

Customer journey on your site starts with the sign-up process. There are multiple configuration settings in RegistrationMagic to curate sign-up experience for your users. These include different types of limits along with granular access controls, offering them to select user roles, display and [hide signup form fields using preset conditions](https://registrationmagic.com/add-conditions-to-fields-in-wordpress-form/), etc. You also have complete control over [redirections after sign-up](https://registrationmagic.com/redirect-user-to-specific-page-after-form-submission/), sending users email updates and even add automation to take care of recurring tasks.

#### The Login System

[Read our WordPress User Login Guide](https://registrationmagic.com/wordpress-user-login-plugin-guide/): The Login Form Dashboard is much more capable and scalable system. You can now edit both Username and Password fields including custom errors and labels. You get a multi-level login validation process that uses reCAPTCHA, IP Filters (Premium) and Two-Factor Authentication (Premium). As with other forms, you can tweak visual elements of the login form. We have included four new custom email templates attached to login events. We have further introduced a new, multipurpose Login Logout button Widget. It renders Login Logout buttons based on user login state, displays login form as a pop-up or page, and important information about the current user on cursor hovering. We have moved all external integration services specific to login under a single section and added Login Analytics with user login timeline under it. Login Timeline also features advance filtering. A new Login tab now appears on user pages inside User Manager, with a chronological list of login events specific to the user.

## FAQ

### Q: I am seeing following error message when visiting the registration form: “Submission limit reached for this form, please try back after 24 hours”

Ans: This is an anti-spam measure built into RegistrationMagic. A registration form can be submitted only certain number of times from a given device within a period of 24 hours. You can define the limit from Global Settings → Security. Change the value of Form Submission Limit for a Device as required. Set the limit to zero in order to disable the feature altogether, i.e. allow unlimited submissions from a device.

Note that in RegistrationMagic Premium, a global override is also available for this setting in Form Settings → Global Overrides.

### Q: “Access Denied” error when trying to view registration form?

Ans: Please make sure that you haven’t accidentally blocked your own IP address! Confirm it from Global Settings → Security → Banned IP addresses from accessing the form.

Also make sure that you are using latest version of RegistrationMagic, as this issue may arise from IPv6 connections, which were addressed in latest versions.

### Q: Submit button not working/does nothing!

Ans: Most of the time this happens due to a javascript error from a third-party plugin or theme. You will need to check browser console and see if there are any errors pointing to a file outside of RegistrationMagic repository. If you are able to trace it to a plugin, try disabling it and reload the registration form.

Another reason can be minification of JS files and inline scripts. Disable these if you are using a plugin for minification and try again.

### Q: Form reloads on submitting and all fields are emptied!

Ans: This may happen if you are using a caching plugin. RegistrationMagic form is a dynamic entity and many features such as analytics may not work properly if the form is served from a cached copy. You will need to exclude the form page from caching inside your cache plugin’s configuration. After, that Purge the cache and try again.

### Q: How do I change the text on the “submit” button?

Ans: You can easily do it from Form Settings → Design. Once inside, click on the animating circle on the submit button. A panel will show up where you can change the button label along with color and numerous other attributes.

### Q: I want to translate some text, how can I do it?

Ans: RegistrationMagic uses standard WordPress po/mo files for maintaining translations. You can use any po editor to translate. We recommend Loco Translate, since it is a free WordPress plugin and works directly from admin dashboard. [Click here to get it](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/)

As a nice little trick you can even modify texts using this, for example label of username and password fields.

### Q: Can I create early bird user registration forms with it?

Ans: RegistrationMagic allows you to set limits to your registration forms and render a different registration form once the limit has reached. Limit can be based on number of form submissions or a set date. To create early bird form system, you need to create two different forms – One for Early Bird user registration and the other one for regular user registration. Obviously, you can set different prices for them. After that, set limit on the early bird form by going to Form Card → Settings → Limits. Turn on ‘Auto Expires’, then define its limits. Below the limits, there’s an option ‘Post Expiry Action’. Select Display another form. A new drop down will appear below it. Choose your regular user registration form. Now go ahead and publish your early bird form and RegistrationMagic will take care of the rest 🙂

In fact you can daisy chain multiple forms like this to create a system of forms! It opens up a host of new possibilities.

### Q: Can an already registered user resubmit a user registration form?

Ans: RegistrationMagic allows resubmission of user registration forms. Therefore it is possible for users on your site to register multiple times if you offer different user registration options.

### Q: Can I create WordPress registration form with payment field?

Ans: Yes, you can create user registration WordPress form with payment option, which allows user registration only after payment has been received successfully. If payment is unsuccessful, user account will not be activated.

### Q: Can I use PayPal with RegistrationMagic?

Ans: Yes, RegistrationMagic is a powerful WordPress PayPal payment plugin which allows adding multiple payment fields with configurable options in your forms.

### Q: Can I use Stripe with RegistrationMagic?

Ans: Yes, Stripe integration is available in RegistrationMagic. Using pricing fields, you can create stripe checkout WordPress pages.

### Q: Can I use RegistrationMagic for registering users for events?

Ans: RegistrationMagic offers general purpose user registration systems with multiple tools. It allows you to create virtually any type of user registration process. Therefore, it is possible to use RegistrationMagic for registering users for an event.

If you want more specialized event registration options like event bookings, be sure to try out our other plugin [EventPrime](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eventprime-event-calendar-management/). It integrates with RegistrationMagic to display RegistrationMagic’s user registration forms when users book tickets for an event.

### Q: Can I subscribe users to my newsletter list, while they register?

Ans: RegistrationMagic integrates with two of the most popular newsletter plugins on WordPress – [MailPoet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wysija-newsletters/) and [Newsletter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter/). You can use anyone of them to subscribe users when they register through a RegistrationMagic form. Note, this functionality is limited to Premium version of RegistrationMagic.

### Q: How can RegistrationMagic enhance my WooCommerce online shop?

Ans: RegistrationMagic combines with WooCommerce to add awesome new features to your ecommerce site. You can use a RegistrationMagic form as default user registration form when users register for your shop. It also displays during guest checkout process. Apart from this, if you have MagicPopup turned on, you can show cart inside one of its panels. MagicPopup updates cart contents in realtime. Please see the first screenshot below for a visual.

Note, this functionality is limited to Premium version of RegistrationMagic.
