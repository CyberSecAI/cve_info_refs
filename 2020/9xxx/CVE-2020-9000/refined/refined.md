Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9000:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the ability to generate stack trace errors that increase the log file size on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption: The system does not limit the generation of stack trace errors, which can lead to excessive log file growth.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exhaustion of server memory: An attacker can repeatedly trigger the generation of stack trace errors, causing the log file to grow rapidly. This can exhaust the server's memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Automated tools: The vulnerability can be exploited using automated tools to repeatedly generate stack trace errors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger stack trace errors which would require some level of access or knowledge of the application to cause the stack trace generation.

**Additional Details:**
- The log files are deleted every 24 hours, but this timeframe is sufficient for an attacker to exhaust the server's memory.
- The affected software is iPortalis.
