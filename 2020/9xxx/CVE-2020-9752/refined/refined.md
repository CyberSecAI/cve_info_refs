- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows moving a local file to any path on the filesystem using system privileges through its named pipe.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control through named pipe.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can move local files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation via a named pipe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the named pipe.
