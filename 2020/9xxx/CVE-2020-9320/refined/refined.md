Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the parsing engine of Avira's antivirus software when handling ISO container formats. By crafting a malformed ISO container, attackers can bypass the AV engine's scanning process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation/Parsing:** The core issue is that the Avira parsing engine doesn't properly validate or handle malformed ISO containers. This allows specifically crafted ISO files to be processed by end users while being ignored by the AV engine.
*   **Lack of Consistent Scanning:** The vulnerability highlights inconsistencies in how Avira products handle archives. Some products, like the command line scanner, may be vulnerable as they do not include an on-access scanner, while others may rely on on-access scanning which is insufficient for initial file inspection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassed Perimeter Defenses:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to bypass perimeter defenses, such as email gateways and HTTP proxies, as these products will give the malicious file a "clean bill of health" because it's not scanned.
*   **Unscanned Malicious Content:** Malicious code or files hidden within the malformed ISO container will not be detected by scheduled AV scans, allowing the malware to potentially compromise systems.
*   **Hiding Malicious Implants:** Attackers can use this to hide implants, exfiltration/pivot servers and other malicious components from detection.
*   **Cascading Damage:** If a vulnerable server is used to store malicious content, it can lead to cascading damage throughout the entire organization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Email Attachments:** Attackers can send malicious ISO files as email attachments.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Malicious ISO files can be hosted on compromised websites.
*   **Network Shares:** Malicious ISO files can be placed on network shares.
*   **HTTP Proxies:** Attackers can use this vulnerability in conjunction with HTTP proxies, where the proxy would allow the file through unscanned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malformed ISO Containers:** The attacker must be able to create ISO container files that are malformed in a way that they bypass Avira's parsing engine.
*   **Ability to Deliver the Malicious File:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious ISO file to the target system (e.g., email, web download, etc.).
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a regular user, if they are tricked into opening the malformed ISO file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was silently patched in AV Engine version 8.3.54.138.
*   The researcher attempted to coordinate the disclosure with Avira but faced resistance and was not able to get Avira to acknowledge the vulnerability in their products.
*   The command-line scanner (scancl.exe) was also vulnerable but was not patched, and customers were not notified, even though it is a popular tool used by many.
*   The Avira engine is licensed by many OEM partners, who may also be vulnerable. The researcher suggests contacting vendors for patches.
*   The researcher provides a link to a 2009 blog post, discussing this same class of vulnerability with multiple other products.
