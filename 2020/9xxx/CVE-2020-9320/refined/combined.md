15   Introduction
16   ============
17   10 years ago I took a look at ways to evade AV/DLP Engine detection by using various

techniques and released a metric ton of Advisories. 10 years

18   later after multiple CISO type roles I wanted to deep dive again and see how far (or

not) the AV  industry has reacted to this class of vulnerabilities.

19
20   These types of evasions are now actively being used in offensive operations [1]. To my

surprise with a few exceptions most AV Vendors haven't,

21   in some cases I found the very same vulnerabilities that were patched and disclosed

years ago.

22
23   Worse than that is the fact that some vendors that were very collaborative in

2008/2009 have now  started to ignore submissions (until I threaten disclosure)

24   or are trying to argue that generically evading AV detection is not a vulnerability.
25
26   A lot of exchanges took place on this matter, for instance one vendor argued that this

could not be called a vulnerability because it would not impact Integrity,

27   Availability or Confidentiality so it can't possible be a vulnerability.
28
29   Even more bothering to me is how the bu bounty platform have created a distorted

Reporter/Vendor relationship and mostly are executed to the detriment of the customers.

30   I am collecting my experiences and will write a blog post about this phenomnon.
31
32   There will by many more advisories, hoping that I can finally erradicate this bug

class and I don't have to come back to this 10 years from now again.

51   Attention:
52   Avira does not patch or update their very popular command line scanner that is still

available for download on their website. Since Avira does not release and advisory
their customers are none

53   the wiser.
54
55   Avira licenses it's engine to many OEM Partners. The OEM Partners that use the Avira
Engine may be vulnerable or not. I would advise that you reach out to the vendors
listed below to know whether you are affected or not. OEM Partners

56   can reach out to me to retreive the POC in order to test.

83   I. Background
84   ----------------------------
85   Quote: "We protect people—like you—across all devices, both directly and via our OEM
partnerships.We provide a wide variety of best-in-class solutions to enhance your
protection, performance,

86   and online privacy—ranging from antivirus to VPN and cleanup technologies.
87
88   A server security should get special attention, as a single employee might store a

malicious file on the network and instantly cause a cascading damage across the entire
organization.

89   With Avira's solutions for server security you can prevent such scenarios by

protecting your network, data, and web traffic. "

91   Avira has the Trust Seal or the

93
94
95   II. Description
96   ----------------------------
97   The parsing engine supports the ISO container format. The parsing engine can be

bypassed  by specifically manipulating an ISO container so that it can be accessed by
an end-user but

98   not the Anti-Virus software. The AV engine is unable to scan the container and gives

the file a "clean" rating.

99
100   I may release the details after all known vulnerable vendors have patched their engines.
101
102
103   III. Impact
104   ----------------------------
105   Impacts depends on the contextual use of the product and engine within the organisation
106   of a customer. Gateway Products (Email, HTTP Proxy etc) may allow the file through

unscanned

107   and give it a clean bill of health. Server side AV software will not be able to discover
108   any code or sample contained within this ISO file and it will not raise suspicion even
109   if you know exactly what you are looking for (Which is for example great to hide your

implants

110   or Exfiltration/Pivot Server).
111
112   There is a lot more to be said about this bug class, so rather than bore you with it in
113   this advisory I provide a link to my 2009 blog post
114   http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

115
116   IV. Patch / Advisory
117   ----------------------------
118   I advise customers on scancl.exe (or Unix Variant) to change to another vendor as Avira
119   is apparently no longer maintaining it, and apparently also not warning customers about
120   vulnerabilities
121
122   Furthermore should be be an enterprise customer of the OEM Partners above I suggest to
123   reach out to the vendor in order to understand whether this flaw was patched downstream
124   in their respective products.
125
126   I recommend to the amavisd project to warn users of this facts
127   https://gitlab.com/amavis/amavis/blob/master/amavisd.conf
128
129
130   In case you have any further questions please direct them to Avira, the above is based

on

131   the best of my knowledge and since AVIRA does not release Advisories we are left in

the dark

132   as to what they officially recommend.
133
134   V. Disclosure timeline
135   ----------------------------
136
137   How Avira handled these reports in 2009 :
138   https://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/avira-antivir-generic-cab-bypass.html
139
140   The below is a summary of 2-3 evasion reports that I have submitted.
141
142   How Avira handled this one :
143
144   15/10/2019
145   Submitted Proof of Concept
146
147   15/10/2019
148   Avira asks me to send a new POC using "EICAR"
149   (Eicar can only be compressed via forcing special compression mode - I refuse)
150
151   22/10/2019
152   Avira forwards to tech department
153
154   25/10/2019
155   Avira argues that this would be the same as adding a password to the file. "You could

achieve the same effect by setting a password on the ZIP Archive,

156   or encrypting the file in any way. This would also make it impossible to scan the

file. "

157
158   26/10/2019
159   I reply that Avira offers products that have no on access scanner (Commandline,

Gateway Products) and point again

160   to my blog post discussing these common arguments and the overall threat model.
161
162   Avira replies by basically ignoring the details given above:
163   "We analyzed your report again. After careful consideration we still have to decline

your report for multiple reasons.

164   First of all, the product you used in your evaluation (scancl.exe) is no longer

supported by Avira and not used

165   as standalone product."
166
167   Editor Note: Their command line scanner (scancl.exe) is in reality still available on

their website as of today and

168   is being used by a massive amount of customers especially as you can easily include it

in AMAVIS.

169   It can still be activated via license and AVIRA still recommends customers to install

it.

170   https://www.avira.com/documents/products/pdf/es/man_avira_antivir-unix_server_en.pdf

(Section 3.5)

171
172   Avira then shifts the blame to their OEM partners and customers :

173   "Additionally we checked the behavior of our engine on your reported cases. When the

engine encounters a corrupted

174   archive, we intentionally do not try to attempt to extract the file and instead report

back a warning to the product

175   (As shown in your output). It is up to the integrator of the engine, on how to handle

these cases and depends on
176   the security model of the setup."
177
178   "Our recommendation is to block these files, but as stated before, this is up to the

integrators and the specific setup.

179    There are also good reasons not to block these files, while still ensuring the

security of our customers. Our AV products

180    for example clients skips these files on scans, because a virus cannot be executed

when stored in an archive. As soon as

181    you extract the file, our OnAccess scanner scans the file, and blocks the execution

of the file, so that our customers

182    are protected"
183
184    Editors note: Again ignoring the many products that have no on access scanner or

where the on access scanner is not effectively

185    used.
186
187    "A similar behavior is conducted when scanning encrypted files, or self developed

archive types. Both types cannot be scanned,

188    but it would be unwise to block these files in general, since you surely agree, that

many encrypted files are not harmful and desired.

189    Please be aware that this reply also applies to your other reports."
190
191   28/10/2019
192   After I reiterated the threat model I get the following reply (Ignoring that their

other products can't parse the container

193   either)
194
195   "Yes we rejected the used application, because it is not designed to be used as

standalone product."

196
197   Editors note: Yet Avira gives guidance on how to configure command line scanners to be

used within gateway products as a

198   standalone product (see tech documentation on Vendor website)
199
200   "Therefore, having a warning that the file is corrupted (as it is) and can't be

scanned, is the most secure option."

201   Editors Note : In some cases it is indeed, but that's missing the point of this report.
202
203   "It then depends, as mentioned in my previous mails, on the integrator of the Engine

on how to proceed. For our consumer

204   products for example, the file will be skipped and scanned as soon as an application

tries to extract the file with

205   our OnAccess scanner. This is also the default process for encrypted files or own

defined, unknown data formats

206   (as you have when you deviate from the ZIP standard)."
207
208   Editors note: Avira continues to ignore that Avira sells products where on access

scanners are not present OR are no efficient.

209
210   "We have acknowledged that you may publish your report as a blog posting. Please do

not mention any names,

211   as this would be against GDPR laws."
212
213   Editor Note: Somewhere in between this I informed Avira that according the policy I

shared I will publish

214   the details effective immediately and no longer coordinate any future vulnerability

with Avira.

215
216   08/11/2019
217   I report more bypasses, in order to be able to handle and coordinate these reports I

reported to a

218   protected bugtracking platform. Informed Avira and send them the links to the POC.
219

220   "Is there any other communication possible to disclose vulnerabilities to us in a

responsible way?

221   Please feel free to sent us the submissions via email, as all other security

researcher are doing.

222   We will not register to any third party bugtracker."
223
224   Editor note:Note the passive aggressive implicitelypointer to not being reponsible by

submitting them

225   all details via a private bugtracker.
226   I inform avira that every other AV vendor is ok to use it and I'd expect them to do so

as well as I cant

227   handle 100 of reports in my free time without the proper tooling.
228
229   "Registering to an external bugtracker is not only very uncommon, but also not aligned

to the most

230   respected responsible disclosure policies (e.g. of Google or Microsoft) which inform

vendors also via email.

231   Your approach is also not compliant to your own set responsible disclosure policy

(Point 2):

232   —
233   When a security contact or other relevant e-mail address has been identified, a vendor

initially receives a mail with vulnerability details along with a pre-set disclosure
date (usually set to a Wednesday 4 weeks later).

234   — Source: https://blog.zoller.lu/2008/09/notification-and-disclosure-policy.html
235   Therefore we would appreciate to receive the details about your findings via email."
236
237
238   11/11/2020
239   I hence reply :
240   "You have received an email and a disclosure date together with a link on where to

find further information. That actually meets the below.

241   Now would you be so kind to actually focus on the matter at hand ? The matter at hand

are potential vulnerability reports that are offered to you,

242   for free. "
243
244   No further reply.
245
246   13/11/2019
247   I am "escalating" to the CTO of Avira as we appear to be connected on Linked in.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

II. Description
----------------------------

```
The parsing engine supports the ISO container format. The parsing engine
can be bypassed by specifically manipulating the ISO Archive
This leads to the Endpoint ignoring the container and the Gateways to
let this file slip through uninspected.
```

III. Impact
----------------------------
It bypasses Avira perimeter defenses and sheduled AV scans.

```
Impacts depends on the contextual use of the product and engine within
the organisation
of a customer. Gateway Products (Email, HTTP Proxy etc) may allow the
file through unscanned
and give it a clean bill of health. Server side AV software will not be
able to discover
any code or sample contained within this ISO file and it will not raise
suspicion even
if you know exactly what you are looking for (Which is for example great
to hide your implants

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
