- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error in the system's handling of P2P connections in certain scenarios.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system does not properly process P2P connection requests in a specific scenario. This allows an attacker to establish a P2P connection that should be rejected by the peer device.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can cause a denial of service by affecting the device's availability through the establishment of improper P2P connections.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have physical access to the smartphone. Then, they can perform a series of operations to exploit the logic error.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the target smartphone is required. No special skills besides the knowledge of the attack methodology are needed.
