Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9546:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how FasterXML jackson-databind handles the interaction between serialization gadgets and polymorphic type handling. Specifically, it involves the improper handling of the `org.apache.hadoop.shaded.com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig` class (also referred to as "shaded hikari-config") during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. When Jackson encounters a type that is defined as a polymorphic base type (like `java.lang.Object`, `java.util.Serializable`, `java.util.Comparable`), it uses the included type information to attempt instantiation of an object using a specific class. This mechanism can be abused by attackers to inject malicious code or trigger unintended actions by providing a serialized payload that specifies a gadget class.
- **Type Handling Mishandling:** The vulnerability occurs when the interaction between serialization gadgets and polymorphic type handling is mishandled. Specifically, Jackson's default behavior of using class names for type resolution during polymorphic deserialization when handling `org.apache.hadoop.shaded.com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig` is flawed.
- **Insecure Default Typing:**  Enabling default typing in Jackson can expose the application to this kind of vulnerability since type information will be determined from the input data and not from pre-defined mappings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit could lead to remote code execution on the server, allowing an attacker to take control of the system, modify data, or cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.
- **Data Manipulation/Disclosure:** Exploitation can potentially allow modification or disclosure of data, depending on the specific gadget class and its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based Attacks:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted JSON payload to a server that uses a vulnerable version of Jackson and improperly handles polymorphic types.
- **Untrusted JSON Data:** The attack vector relies on the server deserializing JSON data that may have originated from untrusted sources, which could be external clients or internally compromised systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Send Untrusted JSON:** The attacker needs the ability to send a JSON payload.
- **Knowledge of Gadget Classes:** The attacker needs to know, or be able to discover, a "gadget" class that is both present on the target system's classpath and is exploitable through the type resolution mechanism of jackson-databind.
- **Polymorphic Type Handling Enabled:** The vulnerable application/service has to have default typing or specific polymorphic type handling enabled in Jackson.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability specifically targets the class `org.apache.hadoop.shaded.com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig` (aka shaded hikari-config), which has methods that can be used as gadgets to trigger unwanted actions.
- Exploitation relies on providing JSON input that includes type information (often using `@class` attribute) that instructs Jackson to instantiate the `HikariConfig` class or another malicious gadget class.
- The lack of proper validation and sanitization of input data is key to the exploitation process.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by version `2.9.10.4` of `FasterXML jackson-databind`.
- Some of the resources mention the use of `java.lang.Object` or `java.util.Serializable`, which makes the vulnerability more likely, as these classes are a broad type and more likely to allow Gadget classes as valid subtypes.
- Using the new “Safe Default Typing” available in 2.10, can also help mitigate this vulnerability.

- The github advisory includes the following details:

```
  Affected versions
    >= 2.9.0, <= 2.9.10.3
  Patched versions
    2.9.10.4
```

In summary, CVE-2020-9546 is a critical vulnerability involving insecure deserialization due to mishandling of polymorphic types and serialization gadgets within the `jackson-databind` library. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, making it a significant security concern. The vulnerability is mitigated by ensuring that polymorphic type handling is used securely and by upgrading to the latest version of the library.
