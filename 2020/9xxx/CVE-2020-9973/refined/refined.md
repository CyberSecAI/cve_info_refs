Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Pixar OpenUSD handles file offsets within binary USD files. Specifically, during the parsing of the file, the software uses offsets read directly from the file to seek to different sections, without validating if these offsets fall within the bounds of the memory-mapped file. This lack of validation allows for arbitrary memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. By providing a crafted USD file with manipulated offset values, an attacker can force the software to seek and attempt to read from arbitrary memory locations outside of the mapped file.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The software does not validate file offsets before using them in seek operations.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The code lacks checks to ensure that the calculated seek addresses remain within the valid memory mapped region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the process's address space, such as layout information, which can be used to bypass mitigations like ASLR.
- **Application Termination:** The vulnerability can cause unexpected application termination as shown in the provided crash information section.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted USD Files:** The attack vector involves providing the victim with a specially crafted USD file that contains malicious offset values in the file header or table of contents.
- **File Access:** The victim needs to access (e.g. open, render, or process) the attacker-provided file. This can be done through various means, such as email, iMessage, file shares, or malicious websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed USD file.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim to access the malicious USD file. No special privileges or network access is required, only that a user or application processes the malicious file.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in Pixar OpenUSD version 20.05.
- The issue is triggered when the USD file is memory-mapped.
-  The vulnerability was tested and triggered via `qlmanage` on macOS, which is responsible for generating thumbnails. This indicates the vulnerability can occur through background processes that automatically render USD files.
- The provided crash information demonstrates an out-of-bounds memory read leading to an `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` exception within the `ModelIO` framework.
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the table of contents offset (`tocOffset`) and section offsets inside the USD file.
- The vulnerability affects applications on macOS and iOS that use the ModelIO framework.
