# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1104

## Pixar OpenUSD binary file format offset seek information leak vulnerability

##### November 12, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-9973

### Summary

An exploitable vulnerability exists in the way Pixar OpenUSD 20.05 handles file offsets in binary USD files. A specially crafted malformed file can trigger an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory access that could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This vulnerability could be used to bypass mitigations and aid additional exploitation. To trigger this vulnerability, the victim needs to access an attacker-provided file.

### Tested Versions

Pixar OpenUSD 20.05

Apple macOS Catalina 10.15.3

### Product URLs

<https://openusd.org>

### CVSSv3 Score

4.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-119 - Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

### Details

OpenUSD stands for “Open Universal Scene Descriptor” and is a software suite by Pixar that facilitates, among other things, interchange of arbitrary 3-D scenes that may be composed of many elemental assets.

Most notably, USD and its backing file format `usd` are used on Apple iOS and macOS as part of ModelIO framework in support of SceneKit and ARKit for sharing and displaying 3D scenes in, for example, augmented reality applications. On macOS, these files are automatically rendered to generate thumbnails, while on iOS they can be shared via iMessage and opened with user interaction.

USD binary file format consists of a header pointing to a table of contents that in turn points to individual sections that comprise the whole file. Pointer to a table of contents, as well as back to individual sections from the table of contents, is represented as a 64 bit integer specifying a file offset where the table of contents, or specific section, can be found.

For example, table of contents is read using the following code:

```
template <class Reader>
CrateFile::_TableOfContents
CrateFile::_ReadTOC(Reader reader, _BootStrap const &b) const
{
    reader.Seek(b.tocOffset);                                        [1]
    return reader.template Read<_TableOfContents>();                 [2]
}

```

At [1] , table of contents offset read from the file header is used to seek into the file and then the parser proceeds to parse the table of contents at [2]. When dealing with regular files, `seek` operations usually just shift the current file pointer to the specified offset, however in most practical uses of OpenUSD (including macOS and iOS utilities and applications) USD file will first be memory mapped. When seek is executed, no check is performed to ensure the offset still falls inside the currently memory mapped file. Since the `b.tocOffset` is a 64 bit integer that is read directly from the mapped file, this can be used to access and read any address in process’ address space.

Similarly to above example, same issue can be triggered when trying to parse individual sections of the file. Following code that parses `FIELDS` section illustrates this:

```
template <class Reader>
void
CrateFile::_ReadFieldSets(Reader reader)
{
    TfAutoMallocTag tag("_ReadFieldSets");
    if (auto fieldSetsSection = _toc.GetSection(_FieldSetsSectionName)) {               [3]
        reader.Seek(fieldSetsSection->start);                                           [4]

        if (Version(_boot) < Version(0,4,0)) {                                          [5]
            _fieldSets = reader.template Read<decltype(_fieldSets)>();
        } else {
            // Compressed fieldSets in 0.4.0.
            auto numFieldSets = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();
            _fieldSets.resize(numFieldSets);

```

When parsing the `FIELDS` section, an offset from table of contents is retrieved at [3] and used in a call to `Seek` at 4. Then at [5] the parsing continues. Again, no check is performed to ensure that the offset falls inside the file, enabling arbitrary memory read. While only `FIELDS` section example is given here, other section offsets are vulnerable, too.

USD files are usually distributed as `usdz` archives which can contains multiple distinct `usd` files each referencing each other, with careful file layout , this sort of vulnerability could be abused to probe the memory layout and influence which files are successfully loaded. This could be abused to achieve information leak and defeat exploitation mitigations such as ASLR.

### Crash Information

This vulnerability has been tested on latest version of macOS Catalina 10.15.3.
