Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9269:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `export_ical.php` file of the SOPlanning application. Specifically, the `users` GET parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `users` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL queries.
*   **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection, which can be exploited to extract data or confirm the presence of vulnerabilities.
*   **UNION-based SQL Injection:** The application is also vulnerable to UNION-based SQL injection, which allows attackers to combine results from multiple queries, including malicious ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Through SQL injection, an attacker can upload a web shell onto the server. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** SQL injection can potentially allow the attacker to access and extract sensitive data from the database. (Not specifically demonstrated in the provided material, but it is a possibility with SQL injection)
*   **Full System Compromise:** Once the attacker achieves remote code execution via a web shell, they could potentially escalate privileges and gain full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `export_ical.php` file.
*   **SQL Injection Payloads:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `users` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Admin Hash:** The attacker needs to have obtained an admin hash for the application (using a different vulnerability) to be able to exploit this SQL injection.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques and tools like SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability successfully.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **Admin Hash:** The attacker must have already extracted the admin hash.
2.  **SQLMap Usage:** The attacker uses SQLMap with the admin hash to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in the `users` parameter:
    ```
    sqlmap -u 'http://HOSTHERE/soplanning/www/export_ical.php?login=admin&hash=HASHHERE&nocache&users=ADM&age=3' -p users --risk=3 --level=5 --threads=10 --dbms=mysql --keep-alive --os-shell
    ```
3.  **Web Shell Upload:** SQLMap uploads a PHP web shell (stager) to the server by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
4.  **Reverse Shell Upload:**  Using a secondary webshell, the attacker can upload and execute their reverse shell.
5. **Remote Code Execution:** Once the reverse shell is uploaded, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit chain involves exploiting a previous vulnerability to get the admin hash and then using this hash to exploit the SQL injection described.
