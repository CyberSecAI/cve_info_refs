Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9014:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content from `epson.com_e68c9a33_20250119_110713.html`  explicitly mentions "Vulnerability Reference: **CVE-2020-9014**" and provides a description, impact, solution and affected versions. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `EMP_NSAU.sys` driver file of the Epson iProjection software. This driver is a virtual audio device driver that is part of the software.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The driver fails to properly handle crafted input sent to it through specific IOCTLs (Input/Output Control codes). The vulnerable IOCTLs identified are `0x9C402402`, `0x9C402406`, and `0x9C40240A`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS). Specifically, a crafted input to the driver via these IOCTLs can lead to a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) which crashes the computer.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local; the attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted input to the virtual audio device driver.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must have local access to a system where the vulnerable Epson iProjection software is installed. No network access is required for the exploit.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Epson iProjection versions 2.30 and below.
*   **Solution:** The vendor advises users to update to Epson iProjection version 4.01, which patches this vulnerability.
*  **Mitigations:** The vendor also suggests implementing standard security practices such as using strong passwords, placing devices behind firewalls, and keeping software and firmware up-to-date to reduce the attack surface.
*  **Affected Products:** The advisory states that all projector models using Epson iProjection are affected if running a vulnerable version of the software

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-9014 is a local denial of service vulnerability in the Epson iProjection software. It exists in the `EMP_NSAU.sys` driver, triggered by crafted input to specific IOCTLs. An attacker with local access can exploit this to cause a system crash (BSOD). The vendor has released a patch (version 4.01) to address this issue, which users are urged to install.
