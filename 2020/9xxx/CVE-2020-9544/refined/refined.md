Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication required for firmware and settings upgrades on the D-Link DSL-2640B router. The `request_parse` function processes HTTP requests, and if the request method is POST and the path matches either `/path_to_firmware_upgrade.cgi` or `/path_to_settings_upgrade.cgi`, the router proceeds with the upload process without any authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated Firmware Upgrade:** The most significant weakness is the lack of authentication before accepting and processing firmware uploads.
- **Unauthenticated Settings Upgrade:** Similar to firmware, the router also lacks authentication for settings upgrades.
- **Direct Access to Upgrade Paths:** The specific paths `/path_to_firmware_upgrade.cgi` and `/path_to_settings_upgrade.cgi` are directly accessible without prior authentication, making exploitation straightforward.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full Router Control:** An attacker can upload and install malicious firmware, effectively gaining complete control of the router. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as eavesdropping on network traffic, redirecting users to malicious sites, or using the router as part of a botnet.
- **Configuration Modification:** By exploiting the settings upgrade path, an attacker can alter the router's configuration, potentially compromising its security or functionality.
- **Denial of Service:** A malicious firmware or settings upload could also render the router unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network subnet as the router's administration interface. This means they can either be connected to the same LAN or WLAN.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Network Presence:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
- **HTTP Request Generation:** The attacker needs to be able to generate and send HTTP POST requests with the correct path to the router.
