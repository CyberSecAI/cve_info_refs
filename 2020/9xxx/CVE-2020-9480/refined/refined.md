Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9480:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content from `www.oracle.com_effce6d5_20250119_114617.html` mentions CVE-2020-9480 within the "Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix". The description provided in the Oracle advisory is:

> CVE-2020-9480 | Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition | Analytics Server (Apache Spark) | HTTP | Yes | 9.8

The content from `spark.apache.org_12d504c1_20250119_114615.html` also mentions the CVE in their "Known security issues" section:

> CVE-2020-9480: Apache Spark™ RCE vulnerability in auth-enabled standalone master
>
>Severity: Important
>
> Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
>
>Versions Affected:
>
>* Apache Spark 2.4.5 and earlier
>
> Description:
>
>In Apache Spark 2.4.5 and earlier, a standalone resource manager’s master may
>be configured to require authentication (`spark.authenticate`) via a
>shared secret. When enabled, however, a specially-crafted RPC to the
>master can succeed in starting an application’s resources on the Spark
>cluster, even without the shared key. This can be leveraged to execute
>shell commands on the host machine.
>
>This does not affect Spark clusters using other resource managers
>(YARN, Mesos, etc).

The information from both sources indicates that the content relates to CVE-2020-9480, though one is from a Spark advisory while the other is from an Oracle advisory that mentions a vulnerability in an Apache Spark component used by Oracle BI.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Apache Spark:** A flaw in the standalone resource manager's master, where a specially crafted RPC can bypass authentication (`spark.authenticate`) and start application resources, leading to shell command execution.
    *   **Oracle BI:** The vulnerability is located in the Analytics Server component of Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition which uses an affected version of Apache Spark.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** The standalone master in Apache Spark fails to properly enforce authentication when handling certain RPC requests.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:**  Attackers can leverage the lack of proper authentication to execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the Spark master process. This can lead to complete control of the affected host.
    *  **Data Breach and Manipulation:** With control over the host, attackers can access sensitive data and potentially manipulate or destroy systems and data.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
   *   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker sends a specially crafted RPC request to the standalone master to trigger the vulnerability.
   *   **Oracle BI:** The attack vector in this case is HTTP, where an attacker interacts with the Oracle BI Analytics Server.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable Spark master service or, in the Oracle BI case, the BI component itself.
    *   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** Attackers must know how to craft the specific RPC request that exploits the authentication bypass.
    * **Oracle BI** : The attacker needs to send a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable component.

**3. Additional Details**
   *   The Apache advisory notes that the vulnerability is only in the standalone resource manager, not in clusters using other resource managers like YARN and Mesos.
   *   Oracle notes that this is a remotely exploitable vulnerability without requiring authentication.
   * The CVSS score for the Oracle BI case is a high 9.8.

In summary, the vulnerability lies in the authentication mechanism of Apache Spark's standalone master, allowing a remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands on the host. Oracle BI uses an affected version of the Spark component and is also affected.
