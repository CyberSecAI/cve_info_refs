Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9395:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow present in the WLAN library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. The specific location and cause of the overflow are not detailed, but it is within the WLAN library of the Realtek SDK.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided text does not give details on the exact impact of the overflow, however, stack overflows can allow attackers to overwrite return addresses on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is not specified beyond the fact that it is within the WLAN library. It is likely the vulnerability can be triggered via malformed WLAN packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable device's WLAN interface, which suggests the attacker needs to be within the Wi-Fi range or be able to inject packets onto the network that the device is connected to.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by VDOO.
- The patch was included in the wlan library built after 21/04/2020.
- For RTL8195AM Arduino SDK, the patch version is V2.0.10-v5, built on 07/09/2021. This indicates that the vulnerability was present in the Arduino SDK as well.
- Multiple other buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-25853, CVE-2020-25854, CVE-2020-25855, CVE-2020-25856, CVE-2020-25857) were also patched on the same date, suggesting a common underlying issue or a series of similar issues.
- The commit logs from Github repositories `ambiot/amb1_sdk` and `Ameba-AIoT/ameba-arduino-1` show that the WLAN libraries were updated around February 2020. This suggests that the fix may have been applied at a later date than the initial patch.
