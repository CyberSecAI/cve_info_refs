OK, seems regression as working on 28.7.2 and with 28.8.x serie starts crashing

BTW, Debian 10 32bit, using stevepusser's repo... just to mention, as always might be related might not

Please provide more details.

- details of the crash/segfault

- desktop environment you are working in

- troubleshooting information from the browser

(Does not reproduce on Windows for me)

By the way, for this site to work you will need to disable ES6 module scripting as their use of it doesn't like our basic implementation, and will refuse to work properly. (dom.moduleScripts.enabled)

Not sure how to get more info, as it seems does not create anything... if i try to start palemoon from terminal emulator and go to that site then browser closes up and just say there "Segmentation fault".

But yeah if i disable dom.moduleScripts it does not segfault anymore ![:thumbup:](./images/smilies/icon_thumbup.gif "Thumbup")

The crash is also reproducible on MX 19's 64-bit build, which basically should be identical to the Buster version in my repo, as soon as I click anywhere on the site. Pale Moon just reports a segmentation fault when started from a terminal.

The desktop is MX's backport of XFCE 4.14.2 to Buster.

Disabling dom.moduleScripts also stops the crashes there.

Sounds like you will have to enable debug symbols and debug it. Does this happen on the mainline linux builds?

I'm using the mainline Linux build 64 bit, on Devuan 64 bit, and it crashed without warning or error message after a couple of clicks.

A null check, of course, will bypass the crash and there IS a bugzilla bug associated that seems to describe this but wasn't very detailed and no one followed up until much later when it was RESOLVED WORKSFORME likely due to refactoring fixing this likely piss poor eager instantiation bullshit that landed in gecko/51.. But that doesn't solve the core issue. I tried a few fixes that SEEMED related but they didn't help either. Also, even if it doesn't crash the site is horribly busted because it is obviously expecting a fully to-spec + whatever bullshit behavior was changed later implementation.

I have exhausted my skill set here. Have fun, whomever takes a stab at it who is likely named Moonchild.

Also, someone file an issue at the UXP repo, I'm going to bed.

Even if it looks like shit we shouldn't be crashing because of content.

Also a crash dump "from tip" won't be usable because I won't have the symbols of that particular build.

For the record, the cause has been found and a new version will be released to address this crash.

Do note, as I said, this will not make the site fully functional.. It just won't crash anymore. ES Modules are on the agenda but it will not be completed by the new Milestone's first release.

| Pale Moon: Release notesGeneral notes: DiD This means that a fix is "Defense-in-Depth": It is a fix that does not apply to a (potentially) actively exploitable vulnerability in Pale Moon, but prevents future vulnerabilities caused by the same code, e.g. when surrounding code changes, exposing the problem, or when new attack vectors are discovered. Rejected security patches: This means that patches were theoretically applicable to our code but considered undesirable, which could be due to unwanted changes in behavior, known regressions caused by the patches, or unnecessary risks for stability, security or privacy. v33.5.1 (2025-01-15)This is a small bugfix and security release.  Changes/fixes:  * Changed the way cookies are handled internally to fix an   issue with cookie database corruption as a result of updates to domain   suffixes. * Fixed an issue with Alternative-Services protocol   negotiation. * Fixed a potential crash scenario with Structured Clone   operations. DiD * Fixed a potential issue with line breaking if out of memory. * Fixed a rare crash with opportunistic encryption. * Minor code cleanup. * Security issues addressed: CVE-2025-0239 and CVE-2025-0238.   ---  v33.5.0 (2024-12-05)This is a development, bugfix and security release. Note: Intel Mac builds are now "ad hoc" signed instead of unsigned, which should solve potential issues with newer macOS while still being compatible with old OS X. If you experience issues, please post in the [Mac board on the forum](https://forum.palemoon.org/viewforum.php?f=41) for support.  Changes/fixes:  * Implemented Regular Expression "match indices" (/d) feature. * Added a way to programmatically clear the DNS cache in the   browser, and added a button to the UI for it in about:networking. * Updated handling of referrer policies to adhere to the   updated spec. * CSS font `variations` keywords no longer throw   an error. See implementation notes. * CSS `border-radius` will now also apply to   element outlines. * Improved the display of amount of cached web content in   preferences when cache is being cleared. * Improved the installer AVX check to skip on early versions   of Windows 10 (which don't support it). * Updated NSS to 3.90.5 (unofficial) to pick up some security   fixes. * Refreshed the built-in list of effective top-level domains. * Fixed several application crashes. * Reduced unnecessary debug/informative messages in release   builds (WebGL and CSP). * Backed out building against ffmpeg 6.0 and ffvpx 6.0 for   causing a video playback regression on full-range videos (levels 0-255). * Cleaned up a large amount of leftover Boot2Gecko code,   simplifying code paths throughout the code base. * From this version forward we also publish language packs   for Persian (Farsi), Hindi, Kannada and Vietnamese. * Security issues addressed: CVE-2024-11693 and   CVE-2024-11704 (DiD).  Implementation notes:  * The CSS font variations keywords (`woff2-variations`,   `truetype-variations`, etc.) allow webmasters to   indicate format hints for `@font-face` font resources so   authors can provide alternative resources for browsers that don't   support `tech(variations)`. The intent of these hints is to   provide an alternate font with variations in addition to regular fonts   without. Unfortunately, some webmasters don't indicate a base font the   variation font face would be an alternate for, which resulted in Pale   Moon throwing an error on the only `@font-face` `src`   entry provided, in turn having the web font not being loaded at all   (because no valid entry was found), breaking website layout. From this   version onwards, we parse the `-variations` keywords   allowing variation alternative font-faces to be loaded, even if no base   font was specified. To webmasters only supplying @font-face entries   with variations keywords: please understand the intent of this CSS 4   spec and always provide a base font entry (graceful fallback).   ---  v33.4.1 (2024-11-05)This is a small bugfix and security release.  Changes/fixes:  * Added a processor check to the 64-bit installer for Windows   to check for AVX.   Note: this check does not work on Window 7/8/8.1 and will allow   installations on non-AVX processors there.   Note: if you are running Windows 10 before build 2004 (before 20H1),   this check may fail on AVX-capable CPUs and prevent installation. * Improved handling of multipart/mixed documents.   (CVE-2024-10461 and CVE-2016-2816) DiD * Addressed CVE-2024-10463.   ---  v33.4.0.1 (2024-10-09)This is a small update to address two important issues:  * Extension compatibility issues with the ghostbuster   (leading to tab handling problems). * Windows 7 compatibility issues in 32-bit builds on some   systems (leading to application UI paint failures/black window).  v33.4.0 (2024-10-08)This is a development, bugfix and security release.  Changes/fixes:  * Introduced the "ghostbuster" concept; this is an automated   internal mechanism to attempt cleanup of particularly problematic web   content after a tab or window is closed. See implementation notes. * Added support for the PROT\_MPROTECT security feature on   targets that use it (notably PaX and NetBSD). * Implemented preferences to give the user control over the   Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and CORS preflight. See implementation notes. * Improved buildability on NetBSD and Altivec architectures. * Fixed building issues on Apple Silicon Mac with XCode 16. * Added workarounds for non-standard MSE/WebM/VPx encoding on   YouTube that could cause video buffering and halting issues. * Dev: Changed the default credentials mode for module   scripts from 'omit' to 'same-origin', aligning with mainstream. * Dev: Implemented `getTransform` and `setTransform`   with `DOMMatrix` arguments. * Dev: Implemented ES2023 Hashbang grammar proposal. * Fixed an issue with JavaScript's `StructuredClone`. * Security issues addressed: CVE-2024-9396. * Rejected:   CVE-2024-9398 (properly informing the user about attempts to use   unhandled protocols by web pages is considered more important than   potential determination whether a handler for such a protocol is   installed)  Implementation notes:  * When very complex "modern" websites get closed by the user,   it is possible that the browser is unable to properly release all the   resources attached to it, especially those resources, modules and   scripts that were part of Shadow DOM or complex interlinked module   scripts. This can then result in "detached" web content and scripts   that continue to use memory, have active event listeners and loaded   scripts. Mainstream browsers are less affected by this as their   multi-process setups will effectively "throw the baby out with the bath   water" by simply killing the relevant content process. Since we don't   have that luxury of a lazy solution to an architectural problem, we   need to handle these so-called "ghost windows" resulting from this   problem internally without restarting the browser process. This version   of Pale Moon introduces the "ghostbuster" concept to try and address   this: an automated, internal mechanism that periodically checks for the   existence of ghost windows and severs links of them, so that   garbage/cycle collection can come in afterwards and release the   resources, hopefully preventing browser slowdowns and inflated memory   usage over time. If this, for some reason, causes issues for you, you   can disable the ghostbuster by setting the preference `browser.ghostbuster.enabled`   to `false`. Also please report (in detail) on the forum   about the issue you're having if flipping this preference to false   resolves it, so we can look into improving this new feature. * By user request, primarily for advanced power users who   need this for their local setups, 2 new preferences were introduced to   control how the browser deals with same-origin and CORS.   + `security.same_origin_policy.enabled`, when     set to `false`, will completely disable checking if scripts     are allowed to be loaded based on the same-origin policy. Security warning: this is a really     bad idea on the open web and you should never blanket disable the     Same-Origin Policy check in a web browser for normal use.   + `content.cors.bypass_preflight_request`,     when set to `true`, will no longer send CORS preflight     requests or check preflight responses and always allow cross-origin     requests. Note that this kind of request is normally only made if     sending a request to a server might result in data changes server-side     (e.g. POST). This preference only does something when CORS is already     disabled; provided primarily for specific corner cases where CORS is     disabled and preflight checks (providing an extra safety net for server     data) need to be shut off too.There are dragons hiding in   these two preferences. Please handle them responsibly.   ---  v33.3.1 (2024-09-10)This is a minor security and bugfix update.  Changes/fixes:  * Backed out support for FFmpeg 7.0/libavcodec 61 (Linux) due   to it causing a major regression in WebAudio (broken on all platforms).   This is being worked on to re-land at a later date. * Restricted the `NotifyPaintEvent` interface to   chrome code only; there is no reason (other than potential   tracking/fingerprinting) to have this accessible from content. * Fixed a potentially exploitable issue in JavaScript (`FetchName`). * Fixed a code correctness issue in XPConnect when creating   sandboxes. DiD * Added a warning for using externally handled usenet   protocols. * Security issues addressed: CVE-2024-8383 and CVE-2024-8381.   ---  v33.3.0 (2024-08-13)This is a major development update.  Important notes with this version:   1. From this version forward, all 64-bit releases require a    processor with AVX capabilities! Please keep an eye on the forum for    announcements of 64-bit SSE builds by the community if you are on    particularly old or otherwise limited hardware that does not support    AVX. 2. For Linux users: Starting with this version, our binaries    are built with gcc 11 on a still conservative but more modern build    platform (Oracle Linux 8). As a result, there may be some lib    incompatibilities if you are still running on a particularly old distro    for some reason. While we try to serve as broad of a Linux base as    possible with our binaries, our lowest common denominator will    occasionally shift to newer distros as a result of O.S. life cycles,    compiler capabilities and available libraries.  Changes/fixes:  * Implemented the bulk of the CSS "cascade layers" spec (`@layer{}`).   This implementation is not 100% complete yet, but should satisfy common   use of CSS cascade layers on the web. * Implemented support for `Sec-Fetch-*` headers,   implementing another mechanism to deal with site security. See [this   part](https://www.w3.org/TR/fetch-metadata/#intro) of the spec for a primer on what this does. * Added support for FFmpeg 7.0 / libavcodec 61 (Linux). * Pale Moon will now look up hosts in DNS ahead of time to   make page navigation smoother. See implementation notes. * Pale Moon will now block access to the reserved address   0.0.0.0 on non-Windows operating systems. See implementation notes. * Dev: Aligned rounding behavior and precision ranges of `toFixed`   and related functions with the spec. See implementation notes. * Dev: Aligned isTrusted for `PostMessage` and `BroadcastChannel`   with expected values on the web. See implementation notes. * Dev: Added the `navigator.webdriver` attribute   for web compatibility (always false in Pale Moon as we do not support   browser automation APIs). * Re-implemented the Durstenfeld shuffle for plugin   enumeration that was unfortunately dropped with one of our past   rebases, to strengthen fingerprinting resistance. * Fixed an issue with character clusters (e.g. for text   selection) resulting from a regression surrounding our improvements for   emoji handling. * Fixed an issue with setting DOM color values. DiD * Slightly improved password form handling, detecting   previously unsupported field orders. * Updated NSS to 3.90.4. * Updated our emoji font to 15.1.2 (Unicode 15.1 with some   additional extras/updates). * Code cleanup:  + Removed unused code related to the (incomplete) FoxEye   experiment. + Removed support code for LibAV and (very) old versions of   FFmpeg. We require libavcodec 58 or later (FFmpeg 4.0+) from this   version forward (Linux). + Removed click event dispatching code that is no longer   relevant. + Cleaned up internal macro use in CSS code (this does not   impact any exposed APIs or code). + Removed the hidden `network.dns.disablePrefetchFromHTTPS`   pref. DNS prefetching should not be treated differently for http and   https.  * Security issues addressed: CVE-2024-7531.  Implementation notes:  * Pale Moon will now pre-emptively look up the internet   addresses in DNS for website navigation (e.g. from links). This speeds   up navigation as there will be no delay for DNS lookups when users   navigate to a new host or domain from the visited page. Please note   that this only deals with DNS (i.e.: looking up the addresses of   websites in the domain name system) and Pale Moon will not pre-emptively connect to the   servers in question; it will just have the addresses for them ready in   case the user decides to navigate to them.   For some people, this may still be seen as a privacy issue (e.g. when   the DNS server operated within an organization is tightly monitored for   "unwanted traffic") as it will regularly fire DNS lookups for hosts or   domains the user doesn't actually visit, so if this is a concern for   you and you wish to revert to our previous behavior, go to Preferences   -> Advanced -> tab "Network", and uncheck "Prefetch DNS lookups". * Pale Moon will no longer allow connecting to the "this   machine" special reserved address 0.0.0.0 (and IPv6 equivalents   [::]/[::0.0.0.0]) on operating systems other than Windows. This is to   mitigate potentially unrestricted access to local resources on   UNIX-like operating systems due to the way the network stack operates   there. If needed for your use case, you can control this behavior   through the preference `network.dns.blockQuad0` -- if set   to `true`, any attempt to connect to the reserved addresses   will result in an error. * We aligned behavior of number conversions with what is   generally expected on the web by mainstream browser engines and/or   updated specs. Specifically, `toFixed` no longer accepts   negative precision ranges, and `toExponential` will now   round up at the midpoint in the decimal significand. * Initially, the mechanisms `BroadcastChannel`   and `MessagePort` implicitly called for dispatched events   to not be trusted, but since browsers marked them as trusted, this was   in conflict with the spec. Eventually, the spec for this was changed to   make them trusted in this case. Pale Moon now follows this behavior as   well.   ---   You can find the release notes for previous releases of Pale Moon on the [Archived Release Notes](releasenotes-archived.shtml) page. |
