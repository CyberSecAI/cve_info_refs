Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `Downloadmanager` service within webOS handles caller identification. Specifically, the `luna-send-pub` command-line tool, intended for public API calls, incorrectly identifies itself as a privileged service due to its service name (`com.webos.lunasendpub`). This bypasses the intended access control restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The `Downloadmanager` service relies on a simple prefix check of the caller's name to determine privilege. This is insufficient and allows an unprivileged user to call privileged methods by using the `luna-send-pub` tool.
*   **Command Injection (Indirect):** While not directly a command injection, the ability to download arbitrary files to arbitrary locations allows an attacker to modify configuration files, leading to the execution of malicious code.
*   **Incorrect Assumption:** The service makes incorrect assumptions about the privilege level of callers based on the name provided to the Luna Bus.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `Downloadmanager` doesn't properly validate the source of a service call using `luna-send-pub`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download as Root:** An attacker can download any file from a URL to any writable location on the filesystem.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation to Root:** By overwriting a configuration file (`/etc/luna-service2/ls-hubd.conf`) and redirecting the `ExecPrefix` parameter to a custom script, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with `root` privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Through gaining root access, an attacker can potentially compromise the entire device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by leveraging a local command-line tool (`luna-send-pub`) present in webOS.
*   **Network:** The initial download of files can be done via HTTP from a network server controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Shell Access:** The attacker needs to have local shell access on the webOS device, which is available to developers on the webOS emulator and potentially on other webOS devices as well.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs a way to host and serve malicious files via HTTP.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was initially reported to LG on October 5, 2020 but was not assigned a CVE ID until later.
* The Recurity Labs blog post provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to exploit the vulnerability to achieve root access on the webOS emulator and the general principles on how to apply to other webOS devices.
* The Debian LTS advisory indicates that this vulnerability has been addressed in a security update for the weechat package, implying a separate issue in that package. However, the primary vulnerability described in the Recurity Labs blog post pertains to webOS's `Downloadmanager`.
