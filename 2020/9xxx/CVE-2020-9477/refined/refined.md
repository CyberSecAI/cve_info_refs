Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-9477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the authentication process of the web-based interface of the Humax HGA12R-02 router. Specifically, the router transmits login credentials (username and password) in plaintext during authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Transmission of Credentials:** The primary weakness is the lack of encryption for the login credentials during the authentication process.
*   **Lack of Authentication Security:** The absence of encryption allows an attacker to capture the login information directly from network traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who successfully captures the plaintext credentials can gain access to the router's web interface.
*   **Account Creation/Device Control:** With access, an attacker could create new user accounts or gain control of the router, potentially leading to further malicious actions within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker would need to be positioned on the same network segment as the target router to capture the unencrypted login traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be able to capture network traffic from the target's network. This could be achieved by being on the same local network, or through man-in-the-middle attacks on network traffic if the attacker can intercept communication between the user and the router..
*   **Packet Sniffing Tools:** The attacker needs to use a packet capturing/sniffing tool (like Wireshark).

**Summary of Key Information:**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by the lack of encryption when the web-based interface of a specific router model (HGA12R-02) is used for login. An attacker could intercept the username/password using network sniffing tools, and then use these credentials to access the router and make changes.
