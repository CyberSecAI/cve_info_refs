Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9060:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 500 series chipsets handle S2 security. Specifically, they are susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) and resource exhaustion when processing malformed "SECURITY NONCE GET", "SECURITY NONCE GET 2", "NO OPERATION", or "NIF REQUEST" messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of malformed Z-Wave messages during S2 security implementation.
- Lack of proper input validation and resource management leading to denial of service and resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS), rendering the device unresponsive or inoperable.
- Resource exhaustion, potentially leading to battery depletion in battery-powered devices.
- Complete disruption of the intended functionality of the Z-Wave device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted Z-Wave messages sent over the Z-Wave radio frequency.
- Exploiting the S2 security implementation flaws to cause denial of service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within the Z-Wave radio range of the vulnerable devices to send malicious packets.
- An attacker needs to be able to craft malformed "SECURITY NONCE GET", "SECURITY NONCE GET 2", "NO OPERATION", or "NIF REQUEST" messages.
