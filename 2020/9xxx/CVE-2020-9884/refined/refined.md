- **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write issue in the Audio component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Processing a maliciously crafted audio file may lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A maliciously crafted audio file is processed by the vulnerable audio component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted audio file to the vulnerable system.
