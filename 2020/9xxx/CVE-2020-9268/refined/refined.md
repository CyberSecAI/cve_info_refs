Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The SOPlanning 1.45 application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-controlled input in the `by` parameter of the `projets.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input passed through the `by` GET parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate the input provided in the `by` parameter, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (usernames, password hashes), and other user data like email addresses, names, etc.
- **Complete database dump:** The attacker is able to dump the entire database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP GET request to `projets.php` with a malicious value in the `by` parameter.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The `by` parameter in the URL is the direct point of injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax and how to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Use of SQLMap (or similar tool):** The attacker would typically use a tool like SQLMap to automate the process of exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a specific example of an attack using SQLMap with the following command: `sqlmap -r projects.req --level=5 --risk=3 -p by --dbms=mysql -D soplanning -T planning_user --dump`.
- The SQL injection is demonstrated to be both boolean-based and time-based.
- The vulnerable parameter `by` appears to be used in an `ORDER BY` clause.

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, and how an attacker can exploit it.
