```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The parsing engine in Avast Antivirus can be bypassed by manipulating a ZIP archive in a way that it is accessible to the user but not to the antivirus software.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the parsing engine's inability to properly handle a malformed ZIP archive, causing it to be skipped by the antivirus scanner.
- Impact of exploitation: The antivirus engine fails to scan the contents of the manipulated ZIP archive, thus giving it a "clean" rating. This can allow malicious code to bypass AV checks on gateway products (email, HTTP proxies), server-side AV software and cloud services. The attacker can deliver malicious payloads without being detected, which can be used for implanting malware, data exfiltration or establishing pivot servers.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malformed ZIP archive.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted ZIP archive and deliver it to a vulnerable system.
