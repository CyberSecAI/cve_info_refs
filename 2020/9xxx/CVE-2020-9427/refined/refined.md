Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2020-06-12 related to CVE-2020-9427:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks on sensitive resource locations when probing DNS service records for HKP/HKPS and WKS/Webkey key discovery mechanisms in Open-Xchange Guard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - CWE-918**: The application improperly validates the URLs derived from DNS SRV records, allowing an attacker to redirect HTTP requests to internal networks. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or blacklist responses received from external services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Discovery**: By redirecting HTTP requests to internal hosts, an attacker can infer information about the internal network topology. By analyzing the timing and response codes, the attacker can identify open ports and services. This information can be used for further attacks on internal services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DNS Server/Domain**: An attacker controls a DNS server or domain that provides malicious SRV records for HKP/HKPS or WKS/Webkey services. These records point to a malicious responder controlled by the attacker.
*   **Malicious HKP/WKS Responder**: The attacker controls the HKP/WKS responder, which sends HTTP redirects targeting internal hosts (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over a DNS Server or Domain**: The attacker needs control of a DNS server or domain to inject malicious SRV records.
*   **Control over a HTTP server**: The attacker needs to be able to receive HTTP requests and respond with malicious redirects.
*   **User Interaction**: The user needs to trigger a key lookup operation that will initiate DNS requests for HKP/HKPS or WKS/Webkey service discovery. While this action may be initiated through normal use, it doesn't require explicit user interaction to initiate the request once the system is configured to perform the vulnerable action.
*   **Privilege level**: Low privilege is needed, as mentioned in the advisory that a CVSS of 5.0 is given with low privilege access needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that using DNSSEC can mitigate the WKS/Webkey service discovery issue, but it depends on the configuration. However, it doesn't specify if this protects against the HKP/HKPS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is found in Open-Xchange Guard version 2.10.3, and the fix is in versions 2.10.2-rev9 and 2.10.3-rev4.
*   The provided text does not explicitly state whether the "user" mentioned in the description is an administrator of an OX system or an end user.  However, given that the vulnerability is related to key discovery, and that the advisory is directed to "subscribers", it is assumed that the user is someone who administers/operates the OX system.
