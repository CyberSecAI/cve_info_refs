- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ShipStation plugin for CS-Cart lacks access control on the `action=shipnotify` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to send requests to this endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure access control:** The plugin does not properly authenticate or authorize access to the `shipnotify` action, allowing anyone to trigger it.
    - **Arbitrary database insertion:** Attackers can insert arbitrary data into the database by manipulating the POST body (XML data) and the `tracking_number` parameter.
    - **Lack of sanitization:** Data provided by the attacker via the XML input is not sanitized before being inserted into the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can modify order data in the database by injecting arbitrary values.
    - Attackers can inject unsanitized text into the database, potentially leading to further issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the data is rendered on the frontend without proper escaping.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote attackers can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    - The attack is performed via a GET request with query parameters to set `dispatch`, `action`, `order_number`, and `tracking_number`.
    - The attack also uses a POST request with an XML payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the CS-Cart installation with the vulnerable plugin installed.
    - The attacker needs to guess valid order numbers to modify existing orders in the database.
    - The attacker needs to be able to format a specific XML payload to insert arbitrary values.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
