##### Description

An integer overflow can happen when looping over items in a list.

This can only happen in rare conditions on 32 and 64-bit systems, as the list must contain more than 2,147,483,647 elements.

On 16-bit systems, this happens with a list that contains more than 32,767 elements.
##### Mitigation

There is no known mitigation.

The upgrade to the latest stable version is highly recommended.

[Commit](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/commit/710247891cdfd4e66ee6d1715e93626def6871f1)

##### Description

After changing the options `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system` or `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user`, the TLS verification function is lost.

Consequently, any connection to a server with TLS is made without verifying the certificate, which could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Connection to IRC servers with TLS is affected, as well as any connection a server made by a plugin or a script using the function hook\_connect.
##### Mitigation

After changing options `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system` or `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user`, you must restart WeeChat.

##### Description

A crash happens when decoding a malformed websocket frame in relay plugin.

This happens even if a password is set in relay plugin, the malformed websocket frame can be received before the authentication of the client.
##### Mitigation

There are multiple ways to mitigate this issue:

* Rremove all relays, see: `/help relay`
* Unload relay plugin with command: `/plugin unload relay` and see: `/help weechat.plugin.autoload`
* Secure relay to allow only some trusted IP addresses, see: `/help relay.network.allowed_ips`

##### Description

A buffer overflow happens when a new IRC message 005 is received with longer nick prefixes.

Note: a "normal" IRC server should not send again a message 005 with new nick prefixes, so the problem should be limited to malicious IRC servers.
##### Mitigation

There is no known mitigation.

##### Description

Date/time conversion specifiers are expanded after replacing buffer local variables in name of log files. In some cases, this can lead to an error in function strftime and a crash caused by the use of an uninitialized buffer.
##### Mitigation

You can unload the logger plugin, thus stopping recording of all buffers: `/plugin unload logger`.
