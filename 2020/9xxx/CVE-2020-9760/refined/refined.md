  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow occurs when a new IRC message 005 is received with longer nick prefixes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted IRC message 005 with longer nick prefixes to the client."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted IRC message to the affected client. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious IRC server or compromising an existing one, or by man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in the handling of the IRC message 005, which is used to send information about server's capabilities and supported features.\nA 'normal' IRC server should not send a message 005 again with new nick prefixes, limiting the attack scope to malicious IRC servers."
