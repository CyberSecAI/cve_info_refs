- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system does not properly check some events, allowing an attacker to launch these events continually.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper event handling and lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a reboot of the affected process, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to trigger specific events continually.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the system or network where the vulnerable device is running, and have the ability to continually trigger specific events. The advisory indicates that the attacker needs to have High privileges and a User Interaction is Required.
