Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9332

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The FabulaTech "USB for Remote Desktop" software installs a bus driver that allows low-privileged users to add and control software USB devices.
- The driver uses the insecure `IoCreateDevice` routine to create device objects, failing to assign a security descriptor that would restrict access to privileged entities. This makes the device object accessible to everyone.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Device Object Creation:** The driver uses `IoCreateDevice` instead of the secure `WdmlibIoCreateDeviceSecure` (for WDM drivers) or `WdfDeviceInitAssignSDDLString` (for KMDF drivers) when creating device objects, leading to a lack of access control.
- **Lack of Security Descriptor:** The failure to apply a security descriptor on the device objects allows non-privileged users to gain control over them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can add a fully controlled software USB device, which the OS trusts, allowing them to elevate privileges.
- **Malicious USB Device Simulation:** Attackers can simulate various USB devices, such as:
    - Fake mouse pointers to click "Yes" in UAC prompts
    - Fake keyboards to type commands in the context of the current user
    - USB-ethernet network cards for MITM attacks.
- **Unconventional Attacks:** The ability to create trusted, fake USB devices opens up new and unexpected attack vectors.
- **Remote takeover:** The software exposes a way for attackers to take over the device, by adding a virtual keyboard or other devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target machine and be able to execute code.
- **Direct Interaction with the driver:** The attacker leverages the lack of access control to interact directly with the vulnerable bus driver, creating and controlling a virtual USB device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:**  The attacker only needs to be a low-integrity user, not requiring admin privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Code Execution:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target machine to interact with the driver.
- **Knowledge of the driver's IOCTLs:** The attacker needs to know how to communicate with the driver, specifically using the control codes (IOCTLs) that allow device creation and USB request handling.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Vendor Response:** Initially, the vendor did not acknowledge or fix the vulnerability. After the public disclosure, the vendor released a fix in version 6.0.2 of their "USB for Remote Desktop" product.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The article provides a proof-of-concept that adds a fake mouse device demonstrating the ease of exploitation, however, due to the vendor not fixing the vulnerability before disclosure the full UAC bypass exploit was not published.
- **USB Background:** The article gives a detailed explanation of USB descriptors (device, configuration, interface, endpoint) and USB Request Blocks (URBs), necessary to understand the details of the vulnerability.
- **Mitigation:**  The article suggests blocking the SHA1 hashes of the vulnerable drivers as a temporary mitigation if a patch cannot be applied.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in the FabulaTech driver stems from its use of insecure device object creation, which allows low-privileged users to inject malicious USB devices and achieve privilege escalation by simulating trusted user actions or other attacks. The attack leverages the direct interaction with the vulnerable driver and an understanding of the underlying USB protocols.
