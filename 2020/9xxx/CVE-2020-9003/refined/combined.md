I used the free Modula gallery plug-in for a long time with no issues and was very happy with it, but upgraded to Pro [Starter] for more features and flexibility. I initially had problems with a conflict that I could not figure out and Modula Support went above and beyond to get it working. It’s a great plugin with excellent support. \*\*\*\*\*
