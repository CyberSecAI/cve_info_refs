# Customs automation - ASYCUDA

[![Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA)](/sites/default/files/inline-images/asycuda-adobestock-648524988_1200x675.jpg)](https://asycuda.org/)

The [UNCTAD Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA)](http://www.asycuda.org/) is an integrated customs management system for international trade and transport operations in a modern automated environment.

Advanced software applications are designed and developed for customs administrations and the trade community to comply with international standards when fulfilling import, export and transit related procedures.

Through its ASYCUDA programme, UNCTAD aims at:

* Modernizing customs operations and helping to improve revenue collection
* Facilitating trade efficiency and competitiveness by substantially reducing transaction time and costs
* Improving security by streamlining procedures of cargo control, transit of goods and clearance of goods
* Helping fight corruption by enhancing the transparency of transactions
* Promoting sustainable development by cutting down on the use of paper, through the use of electronic transactions and documents
