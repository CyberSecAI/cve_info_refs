- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A service in the system does not sufficiently validate a received parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service condition on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious application that exploits the vulnerability. The user must then install this malicious application.
