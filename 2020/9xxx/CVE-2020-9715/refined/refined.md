  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the data ESObject cache within the EScript.api module of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. The vulnerability occurs due to a mismatch in the encoding of the name string during the construction of cache_key used in the insertion and deletion phases in the lifecycle of a data ESObject. When a data ESObject is created and added to the cache, the name used in the cache_key retains the original encoding (ANSI or Unicode). However, when a data ESObject is deleted from the cache, the name used in the cache_key is always encoded in Unicode. This leads to a condition where cache entries for data ESObject with ANSI names are never purged from cache; instead the cache entries retain pointers to freed data ESObjects indefinitely. If an ANSI data ESObject is thus freed, and the code tries to create a new data ESObject with a matching name, a cache hit occurs, but the pointer returned is the pointer to the ANSI-named data ESObject that was previously freed, leading to a use-after-free.",
