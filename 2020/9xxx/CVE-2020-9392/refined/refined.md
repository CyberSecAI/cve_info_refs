Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in the Pricing Table by Supsystic plugin, as described in the article:

**CVE-2020-9392: Insecure Permissions on AJAX Actions**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing permission checks on specific AJAX actions within the plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The plugin registered AJAX actions with the `wp_ajax_nopriv_` hook, which allows unauthenticated access.
    *   While most actions had a separate permission check, three actions (`createFromTpl`, `getJSONExportTable`, and `importJSONTable`) lacked this check.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unauthenticated users could execute these three functions.
    *   Attackers could retrieve sensitive information from pricing tables using `getJSONExportTable`.
    *   Attackers could create and import/update pricing tables, potentially injecting malicious content, using `createFromTpl` and `importJSONTable`.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No authentication required; an unauthenticated user could exploit this.

**CVE-2020-9393: Unauthenticated Stored XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization in the `importJSONTable` function combined with the insecure permissions on AJAX actions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The `importJSONTable` function did not sanitize input parameters, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected.
    *   Due to the missing permission checks (CVE-2020-9392), this could be exploited by unauthenticated users.
    *   The injected JavaScript would be stored and executed whenever a user viewed the page containing the malicious script.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript into pricing table data.
    *   This JavaScript could be used to steal user cookies to gain administrative access or redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   The malicious script could be executed on the front end when a visitor views a page containing the pricing table or in the admin dashboard.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted AJAX request to the `importJSONTable` endpoint with malicious JavaScript in the parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No authentication is required.

**CVE-2020-9394: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to XSS and Setting Changes**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection (WordPress nonces) on plugin endpoints.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Plugin endpoints lacked CSRF protection (WordPress nonces) to verify the origin of the requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could forge requests on behalf of an authenticated admin user.
    *   Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript or modify the settings of any given pricing table.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Forging a crafted request using social engineering techniques to trick a logged-in administrator into triggering the request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Requires an authenticated administrator to unknowingly trigger a crafted request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The article provides a clear explanation of each vulnerability with code snippets highlighting the vulnerable areas.
*   It shows screenshots of how the XSS would execute in the admin dashboard as well as the front-end of the website.
*   The article details the disclosure timeline, which shows how long it took to get the vulnerabilities patched.
*   The vulnerabilities were patched in version 1.8.2.
