- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be stored in the application's database and later executed in other users' browsers
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive information disclosure
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a field or area where it is stored by the application. When other users access the page or feature where this code is displayed, their browsers will execute the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can be an authenticated user with no admin privileges.
