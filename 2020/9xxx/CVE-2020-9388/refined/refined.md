Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9388

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for API endpoints in versions of SquaredUp DS prior to 4.6.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the absence of CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests that are executed by a victim's browser using the victim's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform unwanted actions by a victim with a valid session. These actions could include:
* Adding or removing users from the Named User list.
* Uploading a malicious SVG image which could be used for Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious link sent to a user or a forged request implemented in a SquaredUp DS dashboard. When the victim opens the malicious page or uses the dashboard, the forged request is sent to the SquaredUp DS API using the victim's authenticated session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to:
1.  Create a malicious link or a forged request within a dashboard.
2.  Lure a logged-in victim to interact with the malicious link or the malicious dashboard.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in SquaredUp DS for SCOM and SquaredUp DS for Azure.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.6 and later by implementing CSRF token validation.
- The vulnerability was reported by Giuseppe-Diego Gianni from NATO.
