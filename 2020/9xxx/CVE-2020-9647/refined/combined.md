### Setup requirements setup-requirements

CAUTION

For customers with Feature Packs installed on AEM 6.4. Optional Feature Packs provided by Adobe have dependencies on the release version and service packs. If you have any Feature Pack installed, please contact the AEM Customer Care team to validate the compatibility of those feature packs with this cumulative fix pack for AEM 6.4.

* AEM 6.4.8.4 requires AEM 6.4.8.0. Please visit [upgrade documentation](/en/docs/experience-manager-64/deploying/upgrading/upgrade) for detailed instructions.
* On a deployment with MongoDB and multiple instances, install AEM 6.4.8.4 on one of the Author instances using the Package Manager.
* Before installing the cumulative fix pack, ensure to have a snapshot or fresh backup of your AEM instance.
* Restart the instance before installation. While that is only needed when the instance is still in update mode (and this is the case when the instance was just updated from an earlier version), it’s generally recommended if the instance was running for longer period of time.

NOTE

Adobe does not recommend removing or uninstalling the AEM 6.4.8.4 package.

### Install the Cumulative Fix Pack install-cumulative-fix-pack

Perform the following steps to install the Cumulative Fix Pack on an existing AEM 6.4.8.0 instance:

1. Click the [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq640/cumulativefixpack/aem-6.4.8-cfp-4.0.zip) link to download the package.
2. Open [Package Manager](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp) and click **Upload Package** to upload the package.
3. Select the package name and click **Install**.

NOTE

**Dialog on Package Manager UI sometimes exits immaturely during installation of 6.4.8.4**

Therefore, it is recommended to wait for error logs to stabilize before accessing the instance. The user has to wait for specific logs related to uninstallation of updater bundle before being ensured that the installation is successful. It generally happens on Safari but can intermittently happen on any browser.

### Automatic installation auto-installation

There are two ways to automatically install AEM 6.4.8.4 into a running instance:

A. Place the package into …*/crx-quickstart/install* folder while the server is running. The package gets installed automatically.

B. Use the [HTTP API from Package Manager](https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/crx/2-3/how_to/package_manager.html) - make sure you use `cmd=install&recursive=true` - so the nested package are installed.

NOTE

AEM 6.4.8.4 does not support Bootstrap installation.

### Validate installation validate-install

1. The Product Information page (*/system/console/productinfo*) should now show the updated version string “Adobe Experience Manager, Version 6.4.8.4” under Installed Products.
2. All OSGI bundles are either ACTIVE or FRAGMENT in the OSGI Console (Use Web Console: /system/console/bundles).
3. The OSGI bundle org.apache.jackrabbit.oak-core is on version 1.8.17 or higher (Use Web Console: /system/console/bundles).

To determine the certified platform for running with this release of AEM Sites and Assets, see [Technical Requirements](/en/docs/experience-manager-64/deploying/introduction/technical-requirements).

NOTE

On successful installation of the package, an informational message appears indicating that the content package has installed successfully, such as **“Content Package AEM-6.4-Service-Pack-8 installed successfully.”**

### Update Dynamic Media Viewers (5.10.1) update-dynamic-media-viewers

AEM 6.4.8.4 contains new version of Dynamic Media viewers (5.10.1) which enables check for duplicate names on Image Preset page. Dynamic Media customers are advised to run the following command to bring out of the box viewer presets to an up-to-date state.

`curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:4502/libs/settings/dam/dm/presets/viewer.pushviewerpresets`

which will copy new viewer presets to /conf location.

### Install AEM forms add-on package install-aem-forms-add-on-package

NOTE

Experience Manager Forms releases the add-on packages one week after the scheduled Experience Manager Cumulative Fix Pack release date.

NOTE

Skip if you are not using AEM Forms. Fixes in AEM Forms are delivered through a separate add-on package.

1. Ensure that you have installed the AEM Cumulative Fix Pack.
2. Download the corresponding forms add-on package listed at [AEM Forms releases](/en/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/forms-updates/aem-forms-releases) for your operating system.
3. Install the forms add-on package as described in [Installing AEM forms add-on packages](/en/docs/experience-manager-64/forms/install-aem-forms/osgi-installation/installing-configuring-aem-forms-osgi).

### Install AEM Forms JEE installer install-aem-forms-jee-installer

NOTE

Skip if you are not using AEM Forms on JEE. Fixes in AEM Forms JEE are delivered through a separate installer.

For information about installing the cumulative installer for AEM Forms JEE and post-deployment configuration, see [AEM Forms JEE Patch Installer](/en/docs/experience-manager-64/release-notes/jee-patch-installer-64).

NOTE

After installing the cumulative installer for Experience Manager Forms on JEE, install the latest Forms add-on package, delete the Forms add-on package from the `crx-repository\install` folder, and restart the server.

### Uber Jar uber-jar

The Uber Jar for AEM 6.4.8.4 is available in the [Maven Central repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/adobe/aem/uber-jar/6.4.8.4/).

To use Uber Jar in a Maven project, refer to the article, [How to use Uber jar](/en/docs/experience-manager-64/developing/devtools/ht-projects-maven) and include the following dependency in your project POM:

```
<dependency>
      <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
      <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>
      <version>6.4.8.4</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

```

NOTE

UberJar and other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (repo.adobe.com). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. As a result, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.
