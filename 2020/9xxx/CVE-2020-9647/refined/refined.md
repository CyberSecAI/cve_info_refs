Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9647:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-site scripting (DOM-based)
*  **Affected Versions:** AEM versions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5

*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser. This means an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users, potentially leading to:
    *   Stealing sensitive information (session cookies, user data).
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

*   **Root cause:** The document mentions "User inputs are not appropriately encoded for various components when sending information to the client" in the context of multiple XSS vulnerabilities. DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities typically arise when client-side JavaScript code processes user-controlled data without proper sanitization, which is then used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).

*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into the web page, which is executed within the victim's browser. This can be done by manipulating client-side logic.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious code into the AEM application. This could be through:
    *   Manipulating parameters in the URL, form fields, or other input mechanisms.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application that allow for script injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document indicates that the fix for this vulnerability is included in Cumulative Fix Pack 6.4.8.1 for AEM 6.4 and Service Pack 6.5.5.0 for AEM 6.5
*   The document lists multiple XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-9647, CVE-2020-9648, CVE-2020-9644, CVE-2020-9651), suggesting a pattern of insufficient input validation across various components within AEM.
*   The document also mentions "User inputs are not appropriately encoded for Forms components when sending information to the client" and "A URL that ends with `childrenlist.html` displays an HTML page instead of a 404 response. Such URLs are vulnerable to cross site scripting", which may be related to this vulnerability.
*   The fix requires updating AEM to the specified versions.
