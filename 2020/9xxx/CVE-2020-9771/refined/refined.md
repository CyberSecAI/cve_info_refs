- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in the sandbox implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The sandbox had a logic flaw that allowed circumventing its restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A sandboxed process may be able to bypass sandbox restrictions.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious process running within the sandbox.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute a process within the sandbox.
