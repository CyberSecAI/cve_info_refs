- **Root cause of vulnerability**: DLL search-order hijacking
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation due to the way the application searches for and loads DLL files. By placing a malicious DLL in a location that is searched before the legitimate one, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ColdFusion service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation, potentially granting an attacker full control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves placing a malicious DLL in a directory that is part of the DLL search path. This could be a directory with write access or a location that is higher in the search order than the directory containing legitimate DLLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to write a malicious DLL to a directory that is part of the DLL search path and that is searched before the legitimate DLL location.
