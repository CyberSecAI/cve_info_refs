Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The macOS Installer process, when extracting the contents of an application package to a temporary folder, did not assign ownership of the extracted files to the *root* user. Instead, the installer retained the original User ID (UID) from the developerâ€™s system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect File Ownership:** The core issue is that the extracted files in the temporary directory retain the UID of the user that created the package instead of being assigned to the root user, which should be done for system installations.
- **Permissions Issue:** Due to the incorrect file ownership, a local user with the same UID as the extracted files could potentially modify these files before the installer executes them with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker who shares the same UID as the extracted files can modify these files, allowing them to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the operating system. This provides an attacker with full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires a local attacker with the same UID as the extracted files created by a malicious application.
- **Malicious Application Package:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious application package that, when installed, will cause the macOS installer to extract files with the attacker's UID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must be a local user on the system with the same UID as the user who created the application package.
- **Ability to Create Malicious Package:** The attacker must be able to create or obtain a specially crafted malicious installer package.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affected macOS versions Catalina, Mojave, and High Sierra.
- The vulnerability was addressed by Apple in a security update released on May 26, 2020.
- Cisco has determined that their AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client releases 4.10.00093 and earlier were vulnerable to this.
-  NCC Group also published a technical advisory with more details on this vulnerability.
