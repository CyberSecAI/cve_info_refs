Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9459

**Vulnerability:** Multiple Subscriber+ Stored XSS Vulnerabilities

**Affected Plugin:** Modern Events Calendar Lite

**Affected Versions:** <= 5.1.6

**Patched Version:** 5.1.7

**Root Cause:** The plugin registers AJAX actions for logged-in users, but some of these actions lack proper privilege checks, allowing low-privileged users like subscribers to manipulate settings and stored data. This can be exploited by injecting XSS payloads into the affected data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** Insufficient privilege checks on AJAX actions allow low-privileged users to modify settings and data.
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the plugin's stored data through the exploited AJAX actions. This code is then executed when a user views the affected data (e.g., in the dashboard).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that, when executed by an administrator, can be used to create rogue administrator accounts.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on where the malicious code is injected, it can be executed in the WordPress dashboard, affecting administrators, or on the front-end of the website, affecting visitors. This can allow for various malicious actions such as injecting backdoors or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or steal sensitive data handled by the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **AJAX requests:** Attackers send malicious AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints. These requests manipulate plugin settings or data by injecting malicious payloads.
*   **User interaction:** The stored XSS payload is triggered when an administrator visits the page where the injected code is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-privileged user account:** The attacker needs to have a subscriber-level (or higher) account on the WordPress site.
*  **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress website.

**Additional Information:**
*   The plugin was patched in version 5.1.7.
*   This vulnerability was actively being exploited in a site takeover campaign.
*   The attacks were targeting administrators to create rogue accounts.
