*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability can lead to code execution on the affected device.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to induce users to install a malicious application on their device.
    *   After obtaining root permission, the attacker sends specially crafted packets to the affected device, which triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have local access to the device.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application.
    *   The attacker must obtain root privileges on the device before triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   HUAWEI P30 Pro (versions earlier than 10.1.0.160(C00E160R2P8) and versions earlier than 10.1.0.160(C01E160R2P8)

*  **CVSS Score**:
    *   Base Score: 6.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)
    *   Temporal Score: 6.0 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
