Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-9386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect access control in the Elasticsearch implementation within Mahara.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   File metadata information was being disclosed to group members in the Elasticsearch results, even when those members did not have explicit access to the underlying content. This allowed users to see previews or metadata for content that they should not have had access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Information disclosure: Unauthorized users could view metadata and previews of files they were not supposed to access. This could reveal potentially sensitive information to the wrong users within a group context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote: The vulnerability could be exploited remotely by any member of a group.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a member of a group where a page containing media artifacts was shared with specific access restrictions (e.g., "Admin" or "Member" only).
*   The attacker needs to be able to use the Elasticsearch functionality to search for media content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affected Mahara versions 18.10 before 18.10.5, 19.04 before 19.04.4, and 19.10 before 19.10.2.
*   The issue was identified when a user shares a page with a group and restricts access to certain members (e.g., "Admin" or "Member").
*   When a user in that group searched via Elasticsearch, they would see artifacts even from pages they did not have permission to access.
*   The fix involves changes to the Elasticsearch implementation to correctly enforce access control.
