Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9484:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The content directly references CVE-2020-9484 and provides information about the vulnerability. The descriptions align with the official CVE description of a deserialization vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Apache Tomcat handles session persistence when using the `PersistenceManager` with a `FileStore`. Specifically, the `sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter` is not set to restrict deserialization to expected classes.
   - The vulnerability can be triggered if:
      - An attacker controls the contents and name of a file on the server.
      - The server uses `PersistenceManager` with `FileStore`.
      - `sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter` is set to null or a lax filter.
      - The attacker knows the file's relative path.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is that Tomcat deserializes session objects from disk without proper validation of the classes being instantiated. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
   - **Insufficient Input Validation:** Tomcat fails to properly restrict the types of classes which are deserialized, relying on `sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter`.
  
**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve RCE by injecting malicious serialized objects into session data files. When Tomcat loads these files, it deserializes the object, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
   - **Information Disclosure, Addition or Modification of Data, or Denial of Service (DoS):** The advisory from NetApp also indicates a general impact range of information disclosure, data modification and denial of service, however the primary means of exploitation leads to RCE

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP request sent to the server.
   - **File Upload:** The attacker must be able to upload a file with arbitrary content and control its name and location on the server.
   - **Deserialization:** The vulnerability relies on the deserialization of crafted, malicious objects.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

  - **Attacker capabilities:**
    - Ability to send HTTP requests to the target server
    - Ability to upload files to a specific location on the server where Tomcat persists sessions using FileStore.
    - Knowledge of the path of uploaded file from the storage location used by FileStore to the file
    - Knowledge of a suitable gadget for exploitation
  - **Attacker Position:** A remote attacker with the capability to send requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory provides details about affected and unaffected products including versions.
*   Several sources mention the need for specific configurations to enable the vulnerability, especially the use of `PersistenceManager` with `FileStore` and the configuration of `sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter`.
*   NetApp advises to apply provided patches, but a temporary workaround was also identified which restricts the allowed classes for deserialization.
*   The Debian LTS advisory also mentions CVE-2020-11996, CVE-2020-13934 and CVE-2020-13935 alongside CVE-2020-9484.
*   The debian advisory also highlights the changes in default AJP connector configuration, which was later found to be a separate, but related vulnerability.
