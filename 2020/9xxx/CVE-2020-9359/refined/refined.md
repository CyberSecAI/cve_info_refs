Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-9359:

**Root Cause:**

*   A logic error in Okular's handling of action links within PDF documents. Specifically, the application doesn't properly restrict the types of links that can be executed via KRun().

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted Binary Execution:** Okular uses KRun() to process action links in PDF files which, by default, can execute binaries and .desktop files. It was discovered that Okular wasn't explicitly setting a property of KRun() to prevent binary execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Okular fails to properly sanitize or validate the target of an action link, leading to potentially malicious URLs being executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Binary Execution:** An attacker can craft a PDF that contains a link to a local binary, which would then be executed when the user opens the PDF with a vulnerable version of Okular.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While no parameters can be passed to the executed binaries, arbitrary code execution is still possible if a crafted binary exists on the user's system.
*   **Denial of Service:** Though less likely, a denial-of-service (DoS) condition could potentially be triggered by a crafted PDF.
*  **Limited Scope:** The executed code runs with the privileges of the Okular process (i.e., the user running Okular).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PDF:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF document with malicious action links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **PDF Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious PDF.
*  **Local Binary Deployment (for more impact)** To achieve significant impact, an attacker needs the victim to have a malicious binary already present on their system, typically through a different attack vector.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability requires user interaction (opening the malicious PDF) to be exploited.
*   The impact is limited as binaries are executed without arguments and within the user's context, restricting the possibility of escalating privileges.
*   The fix involves ensuring that Okular does not execute local binaries from action links.
