  "CVE-2020-9363": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The parsing engine of Sophos products supports the ZIP archive format. By manipulating a ZIP archive, it can be accessed by an end-user but not by the Anti-Virus software.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the Sophos AV engine's inability to properly scan specially crafted ZIP archives, leading to a bypass.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Malware hidden within these manipulated ZIP archives can bypass gateway security products (like email and web gateways) that rely on AV scanning. This can lead to malware reaching systems that are not protected by endpoint protection software.",
      "Attack vectors": "Attackers can deliver specially crafted ZIP archives via email, web downloads, or other means.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted ZIP archive that bypasses the Sophos AV engine. They can be an external attacker delivering the file via public facing services or an internal actor utilizing existing infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A specially crafted ZIP file can bypass the Sophos AV engine due to a vulnerability in the parsing engine.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a generic archive bypass. The AV engine is unable to scan the container and gives the file a 'clean' rating.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Malware hidden within the corrupted archive can bypass security measures. Gateway products may allow the file to pass through unscanned, while server-side AV software will not detect malicious code.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the use of a manipulated ZIP archive.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed ZIP archive. They can deliver the malicious archive via multiple vectors, such as email, web download or file shares."
