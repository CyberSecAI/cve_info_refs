Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the SNMP alert settings of SQL Monitor.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: A successful SQL injection attack allows the execution of arbitrary SQL statements as the SQL Monitor's data repository user. This could lead to manipulation or deletion of data stored in the SQL Monitor database.
*   **Attack vectors**:  A logged-in administrator can inject malicious SQL code via the SNMP alert settings.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a logged-in administrator of the SQL Monitor installation.

The content provides more detail than a basic CVE description, specifying the vulnerable versions (9.0.13 to 9.2.14 inclusive), the attack vector (SNMP alert settings), and the specific impact (data manipulation/deletion). It also explicitly mentions that other monitored servers and databases are not affected and that standard/read-only users and unauthenticated users are not vulnerable.
