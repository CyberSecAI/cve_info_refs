- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTML injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary HTML injection in the browser. This can be used to perform phishing attacks, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious HTML code via a vulnerable input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML into a vulnerable parameter or field in the application. The specific location and method would depend on the context of the vulnerable area.
