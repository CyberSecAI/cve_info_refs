Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9344:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is **invalid input sanitization** within the Subversion ALM for enterprise app. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in certain URL parameters when rendering the built-in Web Client for Subversion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. This means that malicious scripts can be injected into the application's response by manipulating specific URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser session when they visit a vulnerable page within the Subversion ALM application. 
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing user credentials
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through maliciously crafted URLs. An attacker can create a URL containing malicious JavaScript code within specific parameters and trick a user into visiting this crafted URL. The application then reflects this malicious code back to the user's browser, leading to execution.
- Vulnerable URLs include:
    - `https:///plugins/servlet/svnwebclient/changedResource.jsp?url=">`
    - `https:///plugins/servlet/svnwebclient/commitGraph.jsp?');alert("XSS by SySS`
    - `https:///plugins/servlet/svnwebclient/commitGraph.jsp?url=">`
    - `https:///plugins/servlet/svnwebclient/error.jsp?errormessage='">&description=test`
    - `https:///plugins/servlet/svnwebclient/statsItem.jsp?url=`
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and convince a user of the application to click on or visit the crafted URL.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to the application to trigger the vulnerability, as it can be triggered via unauthenticated access to the mentioned jsp files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by SySS GmbH.
- The vendor, Marketplace Expert SL, was notified on 2020-02-20.
- A patch was released on 2020-02-21, and the vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2020-02-24.
- The vulnerable version is 8.8.1, and the fix is included in version 8.8.2 and later.
- The severity of the vulnerability was rated as "Medium."
- The vulnerability is present in the built-in Web Client for Subversion (formerly Polarion).
- It was reported that other XSS vulnerabilities were found and fixed by a Bug Bounty program and ethical hackers, but those details are not specific to this CVE.
