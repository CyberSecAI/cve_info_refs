Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9428:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an out-of-bounds read within the EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how Wireshark parses EAP packets, where a malformed packet can cause the parser to read beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: A parsing error in the EAP dissector causes the program to read beyond the expected memory region.
- Missing input sanitization: Malformed packets are not properly sanitized before being processed, allowing for the exploit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash, making it unable to analyze network traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Injection: An attacker can inject a malformed EAP packet onto the network, which would trigger the vulnerability when Wireshark attempts to analyze it.
- Malicious Capture File: An attacker can create a malformed capture file (e.g., a .pcap file) containing a malformed EAP packet and trick a user into opening it using Wireshark.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject packets onto a network where Wireshark is being used. 
- Alternatively, the attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious capture file to a Wireshark user.
- No authentication or special privileges are required.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1, 3.0.0 to 3.0.8, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.14.
- The vulnerability was fixed by using more careful sscanf parsing in the dissector.
- SUSE rated the severity as important.
- The fix is available in Wireshark versions 3.2.2, 3.0.9, and 2.6.15.
