Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-9436:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, specifically within the `/cgi-bin/p/adm/cfg` CGI program.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The web interface allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary system commands by manipulating the filename of an uploaded XML configuration file. Client-side JavaScript filtering is bypassed using an interceptor proxy.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can compromise the operating system of the affected devices by injecting and executing system commands. This allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited through crafted POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/p/adm/cfg` endpoint on the web interface.
*   The attacker modifies the `filename` parameter of the uploaded XML file within the multipart form data request to inject OS commands. The example uses `config.xml;ls${IFS}-la` where `${IFS}` is used to add whitespace.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the device.
*   The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a proxy).

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Phoenix Contact TC Router and TC Cloud Client devices.
*   Specific affected versions are provided:
    *   TC Router series: <= 2.05.3
    *   TC Cloud Client series: <= 2.03.17 and <= 1.03.17
*   The vendor has released patched firmware versions to address the issue: 2.05.4, 2.03.18, and 1.03.18.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
*   The provided exploit example demonstrates the execution of `ls -la`, confirming the successful command injection.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic OS command injection vulnerability that allows a malicious authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server, which could lead to full system compromise. This is accomplished by manipulating the filename parameter during configuration file upload through the web interface.
