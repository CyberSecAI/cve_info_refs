Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-9738:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts that are then stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user who views the affected content. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application, which stores the code. When other users access the affected area, the malicious code is executed in their browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JavaScript into a part of the application that gets stored and rendered to other users.
