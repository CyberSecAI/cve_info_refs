Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the presence of multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Dispatch application. These vulnerabilities occur because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed within the application's interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated user can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the Dispatch application.
- This could potentially lead to actions on behalf of the victim user with the same level of access.
- If the Dispatch application is not properly isolated in a trusted environment, an attacker may be able to steal cookies or redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an authenticated user through manipulating the 'name' and 'description' parameters of:
    - Incident Priority
    - Incident Type
    - Tag Type
    - Incident Filter
- The application fails to properly sanitize the user input of these fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account within the Dispatch application.
- The attacker does not need administrative access to exploit the vulnerability, as it can be triggered by any authenticated user.
-The attacker needs to be able to modify the name and description parameters of the affected entities.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher @thank_you.
- The issue was patched in the v20201106 release of Dispatch.
- Production deployment guidelines were also published to assist in hardening Dispatch deployments.
