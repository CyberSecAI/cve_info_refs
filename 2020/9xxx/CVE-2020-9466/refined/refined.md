Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-9466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Export Users to CSV" WordPress plugin's failure to sanitize user-supplied input before including it in a CSV file. Specifically, the plugin does not prevent users from inserting spreadsheet formulas into user account details fields. When an admin exports this data to a CSV and opens it with a spreadsheet program, the program interprets the malicious formulas, leading to unintended actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Injection: The plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection because it directly incorporates user-provided data into a CSV file without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The plugin fails to sanitize or encode user input before including it in the CSV file, which leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  When an admin exports user data to a CSV file, the injected malicious formulas will be executed by spreadsheet programs (like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc) when the file is opened.
- This can result in:
    - Redirections to malicious websites.
    - Hijacking the userâ€™s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software.
    - Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A subscriber (or any user who can register/edit profile) can inject malicious payloads into their user account details fields within the WordPress site.
- An authenticated admin then exports this data through the plugin, creating a CSV file that contains the payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to register as a user or have the ability to edit their profile information on the WordPress website.
- The attacker doesn't need admin-level access. They only require user-level access to inject the malicious payload.
- The admin needs to export the user data using the vulnerable plugin to trigger the exploit.
