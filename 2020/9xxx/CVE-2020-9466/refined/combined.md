# CSV Injection in Export Users to CSV Plugin

February 26, 20202 min read

![](https://www.jinsonvarghese.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/banner-1544x500-1-1128x484.png)

**Export Users to CSV** is a WordPress plugin that allows website owners/admins to export users list and metadata in a CSV file. While testing the plugin, I was able to find that it is vulnerable to CSV Injection.

> CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files.
>
> When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with ‘=’ will be interpreted by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for performing attacks.
>
> — [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection)

**[CVE-2020-9466](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9466)**

## Impact

An attacker can register themselves as a subscriber in a WordPress website and provide malicious payloads (formula) into the user account details field. When an authenticated admin uses the **Export Users to CSV** plugin to export the details of all the users into a CSV file and open it, the payload gets executed and can lead to unintended actions such as redirections to unknown/harmful websites.

## **Timeline**

* Vulnerability reported to the **Export Users to CSV** team – February 08, 2020

## **Recommendation**

From our efforts to reach the plugin developer, it looks like this plugin is not being actively developed. Until an update fixing the issue is released, it is recommended that users seek out an alternative plugin.

# CSV Injection

**Author:** Timo Goosen, Albinowax

**Contributor(s):** kingthorin

CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites
embed untrusted input inside CSV files.

When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc
is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with `=` will be interpreted
by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used
for three key attacks:

* Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524.
* Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting the user’s tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website.
* Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.

This attack is difficult to mitigate, and explicitly disallowed from
quite a few bug bounty programs. To remediate it, ensure that no cells
begin with any of the following characters:

* Equals to (`=`)
* Plus (`+`)
* Minus (`-`)
* At (`@`)
* Tab (`0x09`)
* Carriage return (`0x0D`)

Keep in mind that it is not sufficient to make sure that the untrusted user input does not start with these characters. You also need to take care of the field separator (e.g., ‘`,`’, or ‘`;`’) and quotes (e.g., `'`, or `"`), as attackers could use this to start a new cell and then have the dangerous character in the middle of the user input, but at the beginning of a cell.

Alternatively, apply the following sanitization to each field of the CSV, so that their content will be read as text by the spreadsheet editor:

* Wrap each cell field in double quotes
* Prepend each cell field with a single quote
* Escape every double quote using an additional double quote

Two examples:

| Input | Escaped Output |
| --- | --- |
| `=1+2";=1+2` | `"'=1+2"";=1+2"` |
| `=1+2'" ;,=1+2` | `"'=1+2'"" ;,=1+2"` |
