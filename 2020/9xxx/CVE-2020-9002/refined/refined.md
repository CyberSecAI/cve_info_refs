Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper Input Validation

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation when setting user roles. Specifically, it was possible to change a user's role from `COMPANY_USER` to `DOMAIN_ADMIN`, even though the latter is not intended to be accessible to lower privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can elevate their privileges from a regular `COMPANY_USER` to a `DOMAIN_ADMIN`, gaining access to higher-level administrative functions and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating user role parameters, possibly during an update or creation process. The specific mechanism is not described, but the vulnerability is that the application did not restrict which roles could be assigned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with `COMPANY_USER` privileges.
