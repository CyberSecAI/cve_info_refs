- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An SQL injection vulnerability exists within ISPConfig due to the way it handles reverse proxy panel access when the `reverse_proxy_panel_allowed` setting in `security_settings.ini` is set to `sites`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered by an undocumented feature that is not enabled by default.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate the database through SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the reverse proxy functionality in ISPConfig, which is only exposed when the `reverse_proxy_panel_allowed` setting is configured to `sites` in the `security_settings.ini` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the reverse proxy panel of the affected ISPConfig instance with a malicious payload and the `reverse_proxy_panel_allowed` setting must be set to `sites`.

This content provides more details than the official CVE description by specifying the vulnerable component (reverse proxy functionality) and the specific configuration required to trigger the vulnerability (`reverse_proxy_panel_allowed=sites`). It also outlines how to check if the system is vulnerable and provides patching instructions.
