## Description

Appointment Booking Calendar is an appointment calendar plugin for **accepting online bookings** from a set of **available time-slots in a calendar**. The booking form is linked to a **PayPal** payment process.

You can use it to accept bookings for medical consultation, classrooms, events, transportation and other activities where a specific time from a defined set must be selected, allowing you to define the maximum number of bookings that can be accepted for each time-slot.

Features:

* The customer can **book an available time slot** from a defined set.
* The booking form is connected to a **PayPal** payment page
* You can define the **appointment booking capacity** for each time-slot.
* A **notification** email is sent to the specified email addresses (one or more) after completed the booking payment.
* A **confirmation** email with the appointment data is sent to the user after completing the booking payment.
* You can **assign a user** to the appointment booking calendar. Users with “Editor Access Level” will get access to the appointment calendar only if it has been assigned previously.
* Exports the appointments to **iCal** format (Google Calendar, Outlook).
* Includes **captcha** validation for preventing spam from the appointment calendar form.
* The appointment calendar has a **printable list** of bookings.
* You can edit the text of the notification/confirmation emails.
* Allows defining the product name at PayPal, the currency, the PayPal language and amount to pay for an appointment booking (you can set zero to let the user pay/donate the desired amount).
* Allows defining the working days, the exact time slots available and the appointment capacity of each time slot.
* **Multi-page calendar:** You can setup it to show many months at once.
* **Multiple time-slot selection:** The custom can book many time-slots at once if allowed in the settings.
* Configurable date format: mm/dd/yyyy or dd/mm/yyyy
* Supports both am/pm and military time.
* Export appointment data to CSV / Excel files.
* You can define the **start day** of the week on the appointment calendar.
* You can define the **minimum** available date and the **maximum** available date for the bookings.
* You can block specific dates.
* New WP Gutenberg Editor Block
* Elementor Editor Block
* Pretty modern administration interface.

Please note that this is a plugin originally designed to accept appointment bookings linked to PayPal payments. The feature for accepting appointments without PayPal is implemented/available in the commercial versions: https://abc.dwbooster.com/download

Payments processed through the plugin are SCA ready (Strong Customer Authentication), compatible with the new Payment services (PSD 2) – Directive (EU) that comes into full effect on 14 September, 2019.

If you want to add a new translation you can add a new PO/MO file into the “languages” folder. If you want to provide the translation for a new language you can send us the texts and we will create the PO/MO files for you. We will appreciate if you allow sharing your translation with other WordPress users.

#### The Troubleshoot Area

Use the troubleshot if you are having problems with special or non-latin characters. In most cases changing the charset to UTF-8 through the option available for that in the troubleshot area will solve the problem.

You can also use this area to change the script load method if the booking calendar isn’t appearing in the public website.

There are also two fields related to the iCal settings: the “iCal time zone difference vs. server time” and the “iCal timeslot size in minutes”. The “iCal time zone difference vs. server time” can be updated to match the desired time zone. The difference is calculated referred to the server time, you may have to test some values until finding the one that matches the desired time-zone. The “iCal timeslot size in minutes” can be modified to have a specific slot time in the exported iCal file.

#### The Restricted Dates Tab

The “Restricted Dates” tab into the calendar settings lets you to completely disable selected dates from the appointment calendar. This is useful for excluding public holidays or other specific dates where no appointments will be offered.

To restrict a date just click it into the date picker calendar that appears in this tab. To remove an already restricted date, just click it again.

#### The Special Dates Tab

The “Restricted Dates” tab into the calendar settings lets you use a different time-slots schedule for specific dates. For example you can have the same time-slots available for all Tuesdays in the appointment booking calendar, but if you want to offer different time-slots on a specific Tuesday then you can use the “Special Dates” tab to overwrite the time-slots for that date.

To use this section click a date into the date picker that appears on the “Restricted Dates” tab and a floating panel will appear for editing the available time-slots for the selected date.

#### The Notification Emails

The notification emails with the appointment data entered in the booking form can sent in “Plain Text” format (default) or in “HTML” format. If you select “HTML” format, be sure to use the BR or P tags for the line breaks into the text and to use the proper formatting.

#### Displaying a List of Appointments

A list with the appointments set on the calendar can be displayed by using this shortcode in the page where you want to display the list:

```
[CPABC_APPOINTMENT_LIST]

```

… can be also customized with some parameters if needed, example:

```
[CPABC_APPOINTMENT_LIST from="today" to="today +30 days" fields="DATE,TIME,NAME" calendar="1"]

```

… the “from” and “to” are used to display only the appointments / bookings on the specified period. That can be either indicated as relative days to “today” or as fixed dates.

There is also a “group” attribute to join the names of the appointments made on the same time-slot (for time-slots with multiple capacity):

```
[CPABC_APPOINTMENT_LIST group="yes"]

```

The “fields” can be used to modify the columns to display, that field accepts the following items (uppercase):

```
CALENDAR
DATE
TIME
NAME
PHONE
COMMENTS

```

… however, in most cases, probably you don’t want to display the phone or comments.

The styles for the list are located at the end of the file “all-css.css”:

```
.cpabc_field_0, .cpabc_field_1, .cpabc_field_2, ...

```

Clear the browser cache if the list isn’t displayed in a correct way (to be sure it loads the updated styles).

#### Opening the Calendar in a Different Month

There is a field in the settings area named “Open calendar in this initial month/year”. This can be used to display the calendar initially in a specified month. This is useful, for example, for bookings of an event that will happen in a future month, so you can display the calendar exactly on that month.

#### Allowing Booking Multiple Appointment Slots

These settings fields are available for each appointment calendar:

* **Minimum slots to be selected:** This is the minimum number of slots that the customer must select in the booking form.
* **Maximum slots to be selected:** This is the maximum number of slots that the customer can select in the booking form.
* **Close floating panel after selecting a time-slot?:** Default: “Yes”. Set to “No” in the case the user has to select various slots in the same date. The price should be set for each total number of slots below (request cost setting).

Note that the **request cost** field will be automatically updated for allowing entering the price for each number of time-slots, giving total freedom at this price setting.

#### Exporting Appointments to CSV / Excel Files

The appointment data can be exported to a CSV file (Excel compatible) to manage the data from other applications. That option is available from the “bookings list”, the appointments can be filtered by date and by the text into them, so you can export just the needed appointments to the CSV file.

#### Appointment Calendar Theme Selection

The current Appointment Booking Calendar version has three pre-built CSS themes:

* Default – Classic
* Light
* Blue

The theme can be selected into the administration area, below the calendar on the settings field labeled “Calendar visual theme”. Once selected a new theme, the CSS file “all-css.css” will be loaded from a different subfolder, be sure to edit the related CSS file if you need further modifications to the appointment booking calendar theme styles.

#### Other Versions and Features

The free version published in this WordPress directory is a fully-functional version for accepting appointments through PayPal as indicated in the plugin description. There is also a pro (commercial) version that includes the following additional features (not present in the free version):

* Ability to process forms/appointments without PayPal
* Form builder for a visual customization of the booking form
* Email reminders for the appointments
* Coupons / discount codes
* Additional drop-down fields for multiple prices/services
* Display calculated appointments price below the calendar
* … and a lot more of rich features

## FAQ

### Q: What means each field in the appointment calendar settings area?

A: The product’s page contains detailed information about each appointment calendar field and customization:

https://abc.dwbooster.com

### Q: How can I center the appointment calendar into the page?

A: For centering the calendar add the needed styles into the “Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of calendars):

```
.appContainer{text-align:center;}
.appContainer2{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:200px}

```

After that be sure to refresh the page that contains the appointment scheduler form or clear your browser cache to be sure that the browser is loading the updated CCS styles file.

### Q: How can I cancel/delete an appointment to make its time slot available again?

A: To delete an appointment locate it into the appointment calendar in the settings area, clear the title (there is a button for that) and save it. This action will delete the appointment (even if the content wasn’t cleared).

### Q: How can I change the calendar’s width and height?

A: You can specify the size of the appointment calendar’s cells, that way the complete appointment calendar width and height can be controlled.

Open the file “appointment-booking-calendar\TDE\_AppCalendar\all-css.css” and about line #139 modify the “padding” applied to the cells:

```
.yui-calendar td.calcell {
    padding:.3em .4em;
    border:1px solid #E0E0E0;
    text-align:center;
    vertical-align: top;
}

```

### Q: Can I put an “acknowledgment / thank you message” after submitting an appointment and completing the PayPal payment?

A: The “acknowledgment / thank you message” shown to the user after submitting the appointment form should be placed at the page indicated in the field “URL to return after successful payment”. Note that after the submission the user is redirected first to PayPal and then to the “thank you” page once the payment for the booking has been completed.

### Q: How do I change the background color of the selected date on the appointment calendar?

A: Open the file “wp-content/plugins/appointment-booking-calendar/TDE\_AppCalendar/all-css.css” … find this CSS rule:

```
.yui-calendar td.calcell.reserveddate { background-color:#B6EA59; }

```

…and replace the background color that appears there.

### Q: How can I export the calendar iCal link with Google Calendar on a regular basis?

A: Please read the instructions on this Google page:

https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?hl=en

To get the iCal feed URL right click the “iCal” link on the calendar list and click “Copy Link Address” or “Copy Link Location” (depending of the browser you are using).

Note: This will automatically export the bookings stored in the calendar plugin to the Google Calendar.

The inverse process (import the items on Google Calendar into the plugin) is available in the Platinum version of the plugin.

### Q: The plugin supports Double-Opt-In E-mail Validation?

A: The Platinum version of the Appointment Booking Calendar supports double opt-in e-mail validation. The double opt-in process includes two steps. In step 1, a potential customer fills out and submits your online booking form. In step 2, they’ll receive a confirmation email and click a link to verify their email, changing the status of the booking to “confirmed”.

The double opt-in e-mail validation is useful to comply the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

More info at https://abc.dwbooster.com/documentation#doiemail-area

### Q: After booking appointment I’m not receiving the emails with the appointment data.

A: Please check if after the completing the payment at PayPal the appointment appears registered in the appointment calendar (some time slot unavailable):

* **If the appointment purchase is registered**, then the problem is that you server has some additional configuration requirements to send emails from PHP. The Appointment Booking Calendar plugin uses the settings specified into the WordPress website to deliver the emails, if your hosting has some specific requirements like a fixed “from” address or a custom “SMTP” server those settings must be configured into the WordPress website.
* **If the appointment purchase isn’t registered**, first check if you are testing the appointment booking form on a local website or in an online website. Note you should test this feature into an online website (local websites cannot receive PayPal IPN connections).
* **If the appointment purchase isn’t registered and you are testing it on an online website**, then check if the payment appears as “completed” at the PayPal seller account (no red flags, no pending mark). Check also if your PayPal account is setup to automatically accept payments in the selected currency. The payment must be “accepted” and “completed” in the PayPal seller account.

### Q: Is referral / conversion tracking available?

A: Yes, it can be done through the automatic integration with the [CP Referrer and Conversion Tracking plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cp-referrer-and-conversions-tracking/).

### Q: How to make the appointment calendar 100% width?

A: Add this CSS rule into the “Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of calendars):

```
    .yui-calcontainer{width:98%}

```

I am new to it so I am still in discovery mode but the page created with booking calendar is working as I was expecting. Need to dig a little bit for multiple booking in the same time slot though.
