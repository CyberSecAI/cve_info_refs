{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The implementation does not limit the parsing of nested JSON structures.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Denial of Service vulnerability due to lack of limitations on parsing nested JSON structures.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can crash the web API by sending a deeply nested array in a JSON structure to a web socket, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Visiting a website under the attacker's control that sends a crafted JSON payload to the vulnerable web API.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make the victim's browser send a crafted web socket message to the server. This can be achieved by the victim visiting a malicious website controlled by the attacker."
