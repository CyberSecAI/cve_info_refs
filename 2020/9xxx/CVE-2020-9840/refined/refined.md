Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9840

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the `swift-nio-extras` library handles decompression limits when using the `.size` limit. It incorrectly checks the size of the *compressed* data instead of the *decompressed* data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect size check during decompression.
-  The library fails to properly enforce the specified size limit for decompressed data when using the `.size` limit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a denial-of-service attack by sending specially crafted compressed data. Because the size check is performed on the compressed data, the attacker can send a small amount of compressed data that decompresses to a much larger size, exceeding the intended buffer or memory limits of the server or client. This could lead to excessive resource consumption, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malicious, compressed data to a server or client that uses `swift-nio-extras` with the `.size` decompression limit enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to a vulnerable server or client using the `swift-nio-extras` library.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to exploit this vulnerability.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
The provided content gives specific details:
- The affected versions of the `swift-nio-extras` package (1.3.0 to 1.4.0).
- The patched version (1.4.1).
- A workaround is provided: use the `.ratio` decompression limit.

In summary, the vulnerability is related to the incorrect size checking of compressed vs decompressed data, which can lead to a denial of service by sending crafted compressed data.
