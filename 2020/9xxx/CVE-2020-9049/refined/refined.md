Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - Yes, the provided content directly references CVE-2020-9049 and includes information from the CISA advisory ICSA-20-324-01, which specifically addresses this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause is an "Improper Authorization" vulnerability. The software fails to perform adequate authorization checks when a user (or attacker) attempts to access resources or execute actions.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **CWE-285: Improper Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks within the affected web clients.
   - An attacker can create and sign their own JSON Web Tokens (JWT) without needing valid authentication/authorization. This allows them to bypass intended security mechanisms.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:** An unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - **Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Under certain conditions, this could lead to a denial-of-service attack, impacting system availability. The advisory notes that this could impact system availability by conducting a DoS.
   - **Unauthorized access**: By bypassing the authentication/authorization, attackers would gain unauthorized access to system functionalities that should otherwise be protected.
   - **Potentially access sensitive data:** The vulnerability may also enable an attacker to access sensitive information that should only be available to authorized users.
   - **Potential system compromise:** Gaining access by bypassing authentication may lead to full system compromise if an attacker can escalate privileges and access critical functionalities.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Network-based Attack:** The attack vector is network-based and can be exploited remotely. An attacker on the network can exploit this vulnerability.
   - **JSON Web Token Manipulation:**  The attacker crafts and signs their own malicious JWT to gain unauthorized access.
   - **HTTP API Method Execution:** By bypassing authorization, attackers can execute arbitrary HTTP API methods on the targeted system.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected system, meaning that they must be able to reach the vulnerable service.
   - **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of API calls to exploit the vulnerability to execute commands.

**Additional Information**

- **Affected Products:**
    - American Dynamics victor Web Client (all versions up to and including v5.6).
    - Software House C•CURE Web Client (all versions up to and including v2.90). This does NOT affect the newer web-based C•CURE 9000 client introduced in v2.90.
- **Mitigation:** The advisory provides specific update paths for different versions of the products.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.1, indicating a high severity.
- **Reporting Source:** The vulnerability was reported by Joachim Kerschbaumer.
