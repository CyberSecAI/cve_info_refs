Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-9450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `anti_ransomware_service.exe` in Acronis True Image 2020 exposes an unprotected REST API on `localhost:6109`. This API is used for communication between the Acronis True Image GUI and the service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The REST API does not require any authentication, allowing any user, even unprivileged ones, to send requests.
- **API Misuse:** The API provides endpoints that allow modification of the ransomware protection settings including adding executables to the whitelist and excluding paths from monitoring.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Ransomware Protection:** An attacker can add their malicious executable to the whitelist, preventing it from being flagged or blocked by the ransomware protection.
- **Disabling Ransomware Protection:** An attacker can exclude entire drives from being monitored, effectively disabling the ransomware protection for those drives.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any local user on the system as the API listens on localhost.
- **Network Access**: Although not explicitly stated, since the API binds to localhost, it is likely reachable by network services running with local users' privileges, potentially enabling remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to have local user access on the target system to send requests to the exposed API on localhost.
- **Scripting Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a script or program that sends HTTP PUT requests to the API, such as the provided Python examples.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability details are more extensive than what a standard CVE description might provide, which usually lacks the specifics of vulnerable API calls.
- The provided Python scripts clearly show the exploitation process by crafting PUT requests.
- The attacker can use the API to disable or bypass the ransomware protection of the software, which could lead to severe security consequences.
