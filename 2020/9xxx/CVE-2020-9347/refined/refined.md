Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-9347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the application's (Zoho ManageEngine Password Manager Pro 10.x) failure to sanitize user-supplied input when creating resources, specifically when creating a resource name. This allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads, such as spreadsheet formulas, into resource names. When these resource entries are exported to a CSV file, the formulas are also exported.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection/Formula Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input. By injecting malicious formulas within the resource name, an attacker can cause spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice to execute arbitrary code or perform unintended actions when the exported CSV file is opened.
*   The application does not sanitize or validate the input before writing it to the CSV file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Depending on the spreadsheet application, the injected formulas can trigger remote code execution. In the provided examples, the calculator application is executed.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** In LibreOffice, the attacker can exfiltrate local files data.
*   The impact depends on the spreadsheet software and the injected formula.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the resource creation process within the Password Manager Pro application. The attacker injects a malicious payload in the resource name input field.
*   The user/victim opens the exported CSV file using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice. This execution is triggered when the application parses the maliciously crafted formula during the import/opening process of the CSV file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the Password Manager Pro application to create or modify resources. This implies that an authenticated user can perform the attack.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of spreadsheet formula syntax and the specific capabilities of spreadsheet applications in relation to formula execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor considers this a problem with CSV format and states that the importing application (e.g., Excel) should handle sanitization/warnings. Therefore, they will not fix it on their side.
*   The vulnerability is in the export function of the application.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Luka Sikic of INFIGO IS.
