---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zoho ManageEngine Password Manager Pro 10.x CSV Excel Macro Injection
---------------------------------------------------------------------
[-] Software Link:
https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/
[-] Affected Versions:
Version 10.x.
[-] Vulnerabilities Description:
If a resource is created with a name that contains a malicious payload (formula), after being exported it will cause particular spreadsheet editors, such as Microsoft Excel 2016 to execute the payload.
Depending on the spreadsheet editor used, different attack methods are possible.
In LibreOffice, for example, it is possible to perform local files data exfiltration.
[-] Solution:
The vendor replied that the vulnerability will not be fixed:
"This issue should be mitigated by the application which would be importing/interpreting data from an external source, as Microsoft Excel does (for example) by showing a warning. In other words, the proper fix should be applied when opening the CSV files, rather than when creating them. So, we don't see this as a security issue at our side."
[-] Disclosure Timeline:
[11/01/2020] - Vendor notified
[11/01/2020] - Vendor acknowledgement
[30/01/2020] - Vendor contacted again asking for updates
[03/02/2020] - Vendor replied, stated that it is a side effect of the CSV format and not a vulnerability in their product

# CSV Excel Macro Injection in Password Manager Pro

---

![](/upload/tbl_novosti/csv-vulnerability8_20210301135.jpg)After exposing the CSRF vulnerability, here we are with one more; this time the problem is in the export function that allows the injection of malicious payload in the input field

Once again, Luka Sikic, one of the tallest pen testers we ever had at Infigo IS, found a vulnerability in the web app Password Manager Pro. Specifically, it is CSV Excel Macro Injection identified in the export function of the beforementioned app.
The thing is, in theory, quite simple – the attacked injects malicious code in the input field. After the app exports it to the CSV the victim opens the document, which in turn executes malicious formula. Our example executed the Calculator app when loaded into Excel 2016, but as you can see, the danger is far greater than that. Especially since it's program dependent so for example you can make LibreOffice do local files data exfiltration.

Unfortunately, although we provided the developer of the Password Manager Pro with a mitigation proposal, security engineers at Zoho, developer of Password Manager Pro, deem that this is a problem with CSV format and that application that reads the file (like Microsoft Excel) should show a warning – in other words, the problem is on the import side, not on the export.
Well, what can you do? If you want to skim through CVE, you can do that [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9347).
