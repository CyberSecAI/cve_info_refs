Class:
CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded credentials
Public References:
CVE-2020-9279
Platform:
Successfully tested on D-Link DSL-2640B, HW version: B2, with the latest available firmware: EU\_4.01B.
Other models and/or firmware versions may be also affected.
Background Information:
D-Link DSL-2640B is an ADSL2/2+ router gateway that provides DSL, wireless, wired connectivity to local networks.
The product has reached End-of-Life.
No security patches or upgrades are currently provided by D-Link.
Summary:
An issue was discovered on D-Link DSL-2640B B2 EU\_4.01B devices.
A hard-coded account allows management-interface login with high
privileges. The logged-in user can perform critical tasks and take full
control of the device.
Details:
The cfm process running on the device implements the main web interface tasks and enforces user authentication during login.
The authentication process relies on the library libpsi.so, which also provides the default credentials for the different account types:
It is possible to log in the web interface of the device with the following account:
username: user
password: 00202b004720
Additionally, the same credentials can be used for logging into ftp, telnet and ssh services.
The credentials are hard-coded in the libpsi.so library and cannot be replaced or removed, other than with a firmware update.
Such credential are also visible in the GPL source code provided for the device.
The source code package EU\_DSL-2640B\_EU\_4[1].00\_3-10-02-29\_GPL.tar.gz can be downloaded from the following D-Link website:
https://tsd.dlink.com.tw/gpl2008.asp
The file asus\_account.h at the location EU\_DSL-2640B\_EU\_4[1].00\_3-10-02-29\_GPL/EU\_DSL-2640B\_EU\_4.00\_3-10-02-29\_consumer/userapps/broadcom/cfm/inc, contains:
#define ASUS\_RMA\_ACCOUNT\_NAME ""
#define ASUS\_RMA\_ACCOUNT\_PASSWORD ""
#define ASUS\_ADMIN\_ACCOUNT\_NAME "admin"
#define ASUS\_ADMIN\_ACCOUNT\_PASSWORD "admin"
#define ASUS\_SUPPORT\_ACCOUNT\_NAME "admin"
#define ASUS\_SUPPORT\_ACCOUNT\_PASSWORD "admin"
#define ASUS\_USER\_ACCOUNT\_NAME "user"
#define ASUS\_USER\_ACCOUNT\_PASSWORD "00202b004720"
Exploitability:
The vulnerability is directly exploitable from any host connected to the LAN or WiFi interface.
The vulnerabilty may be also exploited from an attacker on the Internet, by pivoting on a browser of a user connected to the LAN/WiFi interface.
Impacts:
An attacker can log remotely into the device by using the hard-coded credentials
Full device control can be obtained and malicious firmware upload or changing security sensitive settings (e.g. DNS servers) can be achieved.
Solutions & Workaround:
Not available
