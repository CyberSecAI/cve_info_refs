Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of hard-coded credentials within the `libpsi.so` library of the D-Link DSL-2640B router's firmware. These credentials allow access to the device's management interface, as well as other services (ftp, telnet, ssh).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of static, easily discoverable username/password combinations within the device's firmware. Specifically, the "user" account with the password "00202b004720".
*   The hard-coded credentials are used for multiple services: web interface, ftp, telnet, and ssh

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Device Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker full administrative control over the device.
*   **Malicious Firmware Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious firmware to the device, potentially creating backdoors or bricking the device.
*   **Security Sensitive Settings Modification:** Attackers can change critical settings, such as DNS servers, redirecting traffic to malicious websites, and performing man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **LAN/Wi-Fi Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any host connected to the router's local network (LAN or Wi-Fi).
*   **Internet Exploitation via Browser Pivot:** Attackers on the internet may be able to exploit the vulnerability via a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) style attack, by targeting a user on the LAN/WiFi interface via their web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker must be able to establish network connectivity to the vulnerable device, either through the local network or by exploiting an internet connected user on the same network.
*   The attacker needs to know/discover the hardcoded credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in D-Link DSL-2640B, HW version B2, with firmware EU\_4.01B, but is likely present in other versions including B3.
*   The device is end-of-life (EOL), with no security patches.
*   The hardcoded credentials are also visible in the GPL source code.
*   D-Link was notified of the vulnerability.
