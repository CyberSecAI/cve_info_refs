## Versiant LYNX Customer Service Portal is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting

#### Vulnerability Note VU#962085

Original Release Date: 2020-03-30 | Last Revised: 2020-03-30

---

### Overview

The Versiant LYNX Customer Service Portal version 3.5.2 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, which may allow a local, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

### Description

| The Versiant [LYNX](https://www.versiant.com/lynx) Customer Service Portal (CSP) is a "full-service customer portal that provides real-time information to terminal operators on the status of shipments into and out of a marine container terminal". The LYNX CSP, version 3.5.2, is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, which could allow a local, authenticated attacker to insert malicious JavaScript that is stored and displayed to the end user. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local, authenticated attacker could store malicious JavaScript in the CSP that would execute JavaScript in the browser of any user that views it. This could lead to website redirects, session cookie hijacking, or information disclosure. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.5.3 of Versiant LYNX Customer Service Portal. Customers should log into the Lynx [customer portal](https://csp.poha.com/) to obtain the latest version. |
