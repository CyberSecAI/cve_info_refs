Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9055

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Versiant LYNX Customer Service Portal version 3.5.2 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). This is due to the lack of proper input sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript can be injected and permanently stored in the application's database. This script will be executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An authenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the CSP.
*   When other users view the compromised data within the application, the malicious JavaScript code will execute in their browser.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Website redirects to malicious sites.
    *   Session cookie hijacking, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   Information disclosure of sensitive data.
*   Potentially more severe attacks if the application's security context and user's permissions are high.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the application.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Versiant LYNX Customer Service Portal.
*   **Input Injection:** The attacker would need to inject the malicious script through a vulnerable input field (not specified). This could include any user field where user data is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid account on the Versiant LYNX Customer Service Portal.
*   The attacker must be able to access and interact with the input form fields in the application that are vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vendor Solution:** The vulnerability is patched in version 3.5.3 of Versiant LYNX Customer Service Portal.
*   The vendor states that special characters are now prevented from being input in forms and form inputs are sanitized and escaped.
*  The CVSS score of the vulnerability is 3.2 (Base) with the vector: AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P, indicating it's a local attack requiring authentication with low complexity, with partial impact on integrity and availability, and no impact on confidentiality.
