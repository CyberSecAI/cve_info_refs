Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `getfile.php` file of the "Olea Gift On Order" PrestaShop module.
*   The `file` parameter in a GET request to `getfile.php` is not sanitized, allowing directory traversal attacks.
*   The application prepends `_PS_ROOT_DIR` to the requested file path but does not prevent path traversal sequences (like `../`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. An attacker can use `../` sequences within the `file` parameter to navigate outside the intended PrestaShop directory.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `getfile.php` file does not implement any access controls, allowing any user, including unauthenticated ones, to access and exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:**  The module fails to validate or sanitize the user-supplied `file` parameter, a crucial step to prevent path manipulation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the web server user has permissions to access.
*   **Technical Information Disclosure:** By accessing sensitive configuration or source code files, an attacker can gain technical insights about the server and application, which could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `getfile.php` with a malicious `file` parameter.
*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly manipulate the URL, including the `file` parameter, in a web browser to access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server hosting the PrestaShop application.
*   **No Specific Privileges Required:**  No prior authentication or special privileges are required. The vulnerability can be exploited by any user, including unauthenticated ones.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected module is "Olea Gift On Order" for PrestaShop.
*   The vulnerable file is `getfile.php`.
*   The vulnerability was present in versions 5.0.8 and earlier.
*   The module's vendor did not provide a patch and instead recommended manual removal of the vulnerable `getfile.php` file.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florent BESNARD from INTRINSEC.
