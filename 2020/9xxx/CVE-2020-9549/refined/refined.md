Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `get_type()` function in `pdf.c` of the `pdfresurrect` tool. Specifically, the function uses a fixed-size buffer (`buf`) and attempts to copy data into it using `memcpy`. After the copy, it searches for a terminating character (space, `/`, or `>`). If none of these are found before reaching the end of the buffer, the code continues to increment the pointer `c` beyond the bounds of `buf`, leading to an out-of-bounds write when `*c = '\0'` is executed. The problem is exacerbated by the re-use of the buffer between invocations of the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `memcpy` operation does not check if the size of the input data `c-obj` will overflow the `buf` size. While there is a check `(((c - obj) < sizeof(buf)) ? c - obj : sizeof(buf)))`, this does not account for the scenario where subsequent operations on `c` would cause an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** If the copied data does not contain a space, '/', or '>' character, the pointer `c` will eventually go out of the buffer boundaries. The subsequent write of `\0` at `*c` is therefore out of bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can overwrite arbitrary memory, potentially causing unpredictable behavior, program crashes, and potentially lead to more serious security breaches if attacker controlled data is written out-of-bounds. In the provided example it causes a segmentation fault, but a carefully crafted payload could be used to gain control of program execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** The program can crash due to a segmentation fault when trying to write to an invalid memory location, as seen in the Valgrind output.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** A specially crafted PDF file containing data that causes the `get_type()` function to write out of bounds is the attack vector. The provided example PDF demonstrates the issue using a benign file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to be processed by `pdfresurrect`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue was found in versions v0.12 and newer of `pdfresurrect`.
*   The provided Github issue links to a specific commit `e4de322` where the vulnerable code was introduced.
*   The Debian security advisory confirms this vulnerability and provides a fixed version `0.12-5+deb8u1` for Debian 8 "Jessie".
*   The Github issue report shows the exact code where the vulnerability resides and includes a proof-of-concept using a benign PDF file, although it notes the possibility of crafting a more malicious input to cause an out-of-bounds write, rather than just a crash.

The provided information is more detailed than a basic CVE description, which would only specify that there is an out-of-bounds write in `pdfresurrect`. The Github issue and the Debian security advisory provides more technical information.
