{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from flaws in the CS2 Network P2P solution used by various IoT devices.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack vulnerability due to insecure peer-to-peer (P2P) implementation.",
      "Exposed device credentials.",
      "Exposed sensitive information such as video/audio streams."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to intercept connections to cameras, monitor video feeds, steal device passwords, and potentially gain full control of the device, which can be further leveraged to attack other devices on the network.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting vulnerabilities in the P2P feature.",
      "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks over the internet."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers can perform these attacks over the internet, bypassing firewall restrictions due to the P2P nature of the devices. Attackers can rapidly find vulnerable cameras due to the flaws in the P2P features."
