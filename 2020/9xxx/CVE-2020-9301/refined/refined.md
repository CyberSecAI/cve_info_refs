Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions within the Spinnaker pipeline API. Specifically, the pipeline API endpoint in Spinnaker is vulnerable to object deserialization via loading of arbitrary YAML strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SpEL Injection:** The application directly evaluates the body of HTTP POST requests using SpEL.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The SpEL evaluation allows for the instantiation of arbitrary objects through YAML deserialization, bypassing standard SpEL restrictions and allowing for the execution of almost arbitrary code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user-provided input before processing it with SpEL and YAML deserialization.
- **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** The combination of SpEL injection and YAML deserialization allows for reading and writing arbitrary files within the Spinnaker orca container.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can achieve RCE by crafting malicious SpEL expressions that instantiate attacker-controlled classes leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** Attackers can read and write files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or modifying system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specifically crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable pipeline API endpoint with a content type of text/plain.
- **SpEL Expression Injection:** The attacker needs to insert malicious SpEL expressions within the body of the POST request.
- **YAML Deserialization:** The malicious SpEL expressions leverage YAML deserialization to instantiate arbitrary objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to Spinnaker to send HTTP POST requests to the pipeline API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of SpEL and YAML Deserialization:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SpEL expressions and use YAML deserialization to instantiate the desired objects.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided advisory indicates that the vulnerability was identified by Nolan Ray from Apple Information Security.
- The fix involved using the `SafeConstructor` constructor for all SnakeYAML-based parsers accepting untrusted input, which greatly limits the Java types available during deserialization.
- The advisory also provides details about the specific vulnerable endpoint: pipeline API endpoint in Spinnaker.
- The vulnerability is present in the orca microservice of Spinnaker.
- The recommended remediation is upgrading to Spinnaker versions 1.23.4, 1.22.4, or 1.21.5 and above.
