# Welcome to the Spinnaker Project

Spinnaker is an open-source continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence. Spinnaker provides a single platform that allows you to safely deploy and manage your application in multiple cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes and more!). With automated canary analysis and multiple ways to initiate deployments, you can safely promote your code from a git commit into a dev environment all the way through multiple production environments with confidence in the results. Spinnaker is the most mature and widely productionalized continuous delivery platform built upon the work of Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and numerous other companies to allow fast, safe deploys. Used by numerous organizations including Target, Salesforce, Airbnb, Cerner, Adobe, JPMorgan Chase and more!

# Project status and updates

Note that this repo is only used for issue tracking across the various services at this time. Releases are not managed here nor are updates regularly made to this repository. Please see the following for more information about spinnaker and it’s state:

* [Current available versions](https://spinnaker.io/docs/releases/versions/)
* [The spinnaker slack for help and discussions around spinnaker](https://join.slack.com/t/spinnakerteam/shared_invite/zt-7juwxmx0-nQ4Ud4pJcbuPykX3SXwQrg)
* [Issues page for bug reports, enhancements and similar](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues)
* [Governance for the project as a whole](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/)
  There is a lot of activity and we’d welcome participation!

# More about spinnaker

Manage your SDLC in Spinnaker using the GUI (graphical user interface), or config-as-code. View, manage, and construct [application](https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#application) workflows involving one or all of these resources:

* [Virtual machine (VM) deployments to a public cloud provider](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/pipeline/stages/#bake), "baked" as immutable infrastructure
* [Container deployments to a cloud](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/providers/)
* [Container deployments to Kubernetes](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/deploy-manifest/)
* [Load balancers](https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#load-balancer)

* [Clusters](https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#cluster)
* [Firewalls](https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#firewall)
* Functions

Facilitate GitOps, and grant developers control of provisioning infrastructure for apps. Use Spinnaker’s Clouddriver to deploy to all of the major public cloud providers and Kubernetes. You may even orchestrate configuration and firmware changes as part of Spinnaker delivery [pipelines](https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#pipeline).

# Why Do I Need Spinnaker?

Use Spinnaker to create a “paved road” for application delivery, with guardrails that ensure only valid infrastructure and configuration reach production.

Free development teams from burdensome ops provisioning while automating reinforcement of business and regulatory requirements. Delivery automation strategies such as canary deployments provide the safety necessary to capture value from quick innovation, while protecting against business and end-user impact.

# Tech Specs

Spinnaker consists of a number of [independent microservices](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/architecture/), with the [Halyard CLI tool](https://github.com/spinnaker/halyard) or the [Kubernetes Operator](https://www.armory.io/spinnaker-community/spinnaker-operator/) (Beta)
managing the lifecycle of the other services. A [variety of SDLC tools](https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/setup/other_config/) integrate with Spinnaker, and its plugin framework makes Spinnaker more easily customizable to your needs. Plugins allow us to add system integrations without updating Spinnaker, broadening its potential
to easily leverage the entire software delivery toolchain. With this in place, Spinnaker is evolving towards a smaller threat surface,
enabling performance and operational advantages. Meanwhile, managed delivery, a newer Spinnaker featureset, provides declarative definitions of common
infrastructure and other requirements; users can declare requirements using those
prebuilt definitions and move changes through environments via a visual interface.

---

This repository centralizes issue tracking across Spinnaker for each microservice.
The core code making up Spinnaker’s microservices is found in the other [Spinnaker repositories](https://github.com/spinnaker).

# Using Spinnaker

Spinnaker users should refer to the main
[Spinnaker site](https://www.spinnaker.io/) and [Installation](https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/setup/) guide.

###### Advisory ID:

NFLX-2020-006

###### Advisory Title:

SpEL Template injection on Netflix Spinnaker

###### Author:

Aladdin Almubayed / amubaied@netflix.com

###### Release Date:

2020-12-08

###### Application:

Spinnaker

###### CVE ID

CVE-2020-9301

###### Source:

<https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker>

###### Severity:

High

###### Overview:

Nolan Ray from Apple Information Security identified a security vulnerability in Spinnaker. The vulnerability exists within the handling of SpEL expressions that allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files within the orca container via authenticated HTTP POST requests.

###### Impact:

This issue can lead to Remote Code Execution.

###### Description:

The pipeline API endpoint in spinnaker is vulnerable to object deserialization via loading of arbitrary YAML strings. This allows for the instantiation of attacker controlled classes, which can lead to arbitrary reading and writing of files as the spinnaker user within the orca container. Specifically, the entire body of a POST request with content type text/plain sent to the vulnerable endpoint will be evaluated with the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) which allows for almost arbitrary code execution with certain limitations. In addition to the standard SpEL features, orca has added some URL fetching and YAML parsing functionality. This additional functionality allows for the instantiation of arbitrary objects via YAML deserialization which allows for the bypass of restrictions in SpEL evaluation. This results in arbitrary file read/write within the orca container.

###### The Fix

All SnakeYAML-based parsers accepting untrusted input now use the `SafeConstructor` constructor. This allowlist greatly limits the Java types available during deserialization

###### Patch:

Spinnaker has been [patched](https://spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/) please upgrade to spinnaker version 1.23.4, 1.22.4 or 1.21.5 and above
