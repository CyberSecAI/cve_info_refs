The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, which addresses a security fix related to GSL-2020-026. It modifies the `src/x509.c` file, specifically concerning how X.509 certificate checks are performed. While it doesn't explicitly state the vulnerability details, the commit message "fix security: GSL-2020-026" indicates that the changes are meant to address a security issue documented under GSL-2020-026. The code changes suggest the vulnerability lies in how hostname, email and IP checks are performed on X.509 certificates.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The original code used `lua_tostring` and `strlen` to get the hostname, email, and IP to check against the certificate. This method is vulnerable if the string contains embedded null bytes, as strlen will stop at the first null byte, resulting in an incorrect length passed to the underlying OpenSSL function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Handling of Null Bytes:** The original code used `lua_tostring` and `strlen` to obtain the hostname, email, or IP address. These functions are vulnerable to null byte injection. If the input string contains embedded null characters, strlen will calculate an incorrect string length resulting in a potential bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass certificate validation checks by injecting null bytes into the hostname, email, or IP address strings, potentially impersonating trusted entities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker would need to control the hostname, email or IP that is passed to the `openssl_x509_check_host`, `openssl_x509_check_email` or `openssl_x509_check_ip` functions in the lua-openssl library. By injecting null bytes into the provided string, they could cause a miscalculation in the length, leading to incorrect validation against the X.509 certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply the input string to the vulnerable function. This is most likely in the form of a network request, but the method will depend on how the lua-openssl library is used in the wider application.

**Mitigation:** The code changes replace `lua_tostring` and `strlen` with `luaL_checklstring` to properly handle input strings with null bytes. Additionally, the code introduces a new function `openssl_push_check_result` to handle return values from the OpenSSL functions and return more informative error messages to the caller. It also uses `OPENSSL_free` to free the `peer` variable when calling `X509_check_host` which has been fixed to return a dynamically allocated string.
