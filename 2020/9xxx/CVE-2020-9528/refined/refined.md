The provided content does not directly discuss CVE-2020-9528. However, it mentions related CVEs (CVE-2020-9525 and CVE-2020-9526) which belong to the same vendor and may describe a similar vulnerability. This content describes vulnerabilities in devices using CS2 Network P2P.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Flaws in the P2P implementation of CS2 Network P2P.
- Insecure design of P2P communication, allowing direct connections to devices bypassing firewalls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) vulnerability: Attackers can intercept communication between the device and the user.
- Insecure encryption: Many devices don't properly encrypt traffic.
- Weak or missing password protection: Passwords can be stolen by performing MitM attacks.
- UID predictability: Attackers may be able to calculate UIDs, allowing them to find and connect to devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to video and audio feeds.
- Theft of device credentials (usernames and passwords).
- Complete device takeover, allowing the attacker to use the device and the network as they wish.
- Ability to attack other computers on the network and pinpoint the location of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting flaws in P2P features to find vulnerable cameras.
- Intercepting communication between a device and a user through MitM attacks over the Internet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to connect to devices over the internet.
- Ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Knowledge of the P2P protocol and the ability to calculate UIDs (in some cases).

The content focuses on the wider problem of insecure P2P implementations in IoT devices. It highlights that devices using certain P2P solutions (specifically Shenzhen Yunni iLnkP2P and CS2 Network P2P) are vulnerable to various attacks due to insecure design and lack of encryption. The content provides more detail on the wider implications of insecure P2P usage than would be found in a single CVE entry.
