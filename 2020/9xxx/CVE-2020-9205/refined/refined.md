- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of parameters when creating CSV files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious content into CSV files generated by the ManageOne product. This could lead to arbitrary code execution when the injected CSV file is opened with a vulnerable application.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with common privileges can exploit specific operations within the ManageOne product to inject malicious content into CSV files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have common user privileges and be able to connect to the ManageOne device.
