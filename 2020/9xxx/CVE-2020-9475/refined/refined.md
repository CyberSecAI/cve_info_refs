Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `logrotate` script on the S. Siedle & Soehne SG 150-0 Smart Gateway. Specifically, the script's logic for handling MySQL log rotation was flawed, allowing for a race condition to be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** A race condition exists in the logrotate script when it attempts to flush or move the MySQL log file. The script first checks if the MySQL server is running using `mysqladmin ping`. If the server is not running (or not accessible), the script moves the log file and recreates it. An attacker can exploit the time gap between these operations, specifically between the `mv` and `touch` commands in the logrotate script.
- **Logrotate Script Misconfiguration:**  The logrotate script does not sufficiently prevent the manipulation of log files through symlink creation during its execution.
- **Insecure File Handling:**  The script does not properly handle the race condition, and creates new files, even if these are created by a symlink, as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the race condition and controlling the logrotate script's actions, an attacker can gain root privileges on the gateway. This allows the attacker to change passwords, install malicious software, or take full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local shell access on the gateway, although this access can be gained by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
- **Timing:** The exploit relies on precise timing to win the race condition within the logrotate script.
- **File system manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create symlinks in the file system to achieve root access.
- **Code execution:** Arbitrary code execution under root privileges allows the attacker to install a suid root shell that can be later used to gain permanent root access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Shell Access:** The attacker needs to gain shell access on the device, which can be achieved by other vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-9473 and CVE-2020-9474.
- **Ability to execute compiled programs:** The attacker needs to be able to compile and copy three small programs onto the device (bind, symlink and root)
- **Timing Control:** The attacker needs to be able to control the execution of their exploit code and the actions of the system to trigger the race condition.

**Additional details not in the original CVE description:**
- The provided article provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the exploitation process, including the creation of helper programs (bind, symlink, and root) written in C, and how they are used in the exploit chain to gain root access via logrotate.
- It also explains the specific code snippets within the `logrotate` script that are vulnerable.
- The article explains that the attacker needs to exploit the time gap between log rotation events, specifically the commands `mv` and `touch`.
- It also gives a description of the binaries used to create and trigger the privilege escalation.
