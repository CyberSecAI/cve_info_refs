**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
