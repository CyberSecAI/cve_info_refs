## Firmware

A firmware update can resolve issues that the previous firmware version may have and improve its current performance.

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

* **Please upgrade firmware from the local TP-Link official website of the purchase location for your TP-Link device, otherwise it will be against the warranty. Please click [here](/choose-your-location/) to change site if necessary.**
* Please verify the hardware version of your device for the firmware version. Wrong firmware upgrade may damage your device and void the warranty.
* **Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, as it may cause permanent damage to the product.**
* To avoid wireless disconnect issue during firmware upgrade process, it's recommended to upload firmware with wired connection unless there is no LAN/Ethernet port on your TP-Link device.
* It's recommended that users stop all Internet applications on the computer, or simply disconnect Internet line from the device before the upgrade.
* Use decompression software such as WinZIP or WinRAR to extract the file you download before the upgrade.

<div class="content white-text"><p>Recently we were playing DavinciCTF 2023 and I came across a forensics challenge, David Cicode, which was based on DPAPI encrypted chrome credentials. In a real life scenario we use tools like mimikatz to easily get master keys and read chrome secrets but in this challenge all I had was an image file which means offline extraction of secrets without the use of mimikatz!</p></div>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Mount EWF image file</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>Mounting an EWF image file is simple. Make sure you have `libewf` or `ewf-tools` depending on the OS you are using. You will have access to `ewfmount` command :</p></div>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/KYeHL3R.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>I copied the image found inside for easier access and mounted it using the following mount command :</p></div>
<pre><code>sudo mount ewf1 mpoint -o ro,loop,show\_sys\_files,streams\_interace=windows</code></pre>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/meUNyG5.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>yes I know, colors gone wrong, I still haven't fixed that. Anyways now the Users directory was readable. According to the challenge description goal was to find YouTube credentials.</p></div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">Chrome secrets</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>In windows you will find juicy stuff under the following directory :</p></div>
<pre><code>/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>We are interested in two files, `Local State` and `Login Data`. State is a JSON file which contains browser information, profile information and encrypted keys for our logins. Login data is a sqlite3 database which contains encrypted passwords.</p></div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">The problem</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p> The AES key in state file is protected by Windows DPAPI. We need to decrypt the DPAPI blob to get the AES key and then use it to read the passwords from database.</p></div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">Crack user password</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>Using `DPAPImk2john.py` we can generate a hash based on SID and masterkey of the user. To get SID and masterkey we can simply browse to the following path :</p></div>
<pre><code>/Users/DavidCicode/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Protect</code></pre>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/bpI7ebM.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>Directory name is the SID and the filename inside is the masterkey value</p></div>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Decrypt masterkey file</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>Using the password and power of impacket tools we can now read the masterkey file</p></div>
<pre><code>dpapi.py masterkey -file mpoint/Users/DavidCicode/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Protect/S-1-5-21-3100841193-2683041198-3967357107-1000/1acbbc52-02e6-404d-b139-43d93da54db8 -sid S-1-5-21-3100841193-2683041198-3967357107-1000 -password ilovedavid</code></pre>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/rr32wdU.png"> </div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">David deleted everything!</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>At this point the challenge took a turn and it looks like both state file and login data file were deleted, so now first we need to recover them. For this step I used `TestDisk` utility :</p></div>
<pre><code>sudo testdisk ewf1</code></pre>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/Vvzy5s6.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>Here is the Login Data database file :</p></div>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/5zrNEk1.png"> </div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">Decrypting AES key</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>In order to get the AES key first we need to extract it from state file and decode it :</p></div>
<pre><code>import json
import base64
with open('/home/twh/ctf/dvc\_2023/cicode/recovered/local\_state', 'rb') as state\_file:
encrypted\_key = json.load(state\_file)
encrypted\_key = encrypted\_key['os\_crypt']['encrypted\_key']
decrypted\_key = base64.b64decode(encrypted\_key)
with open('dec\_data', 'wb') as outfile:
outfile.write(decrypted\_key[5:])</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>next we need to decrypt this DPAPI blob using the masterkey :</p></div>
<pre><code>dpapi.py unprotect -file dec\_data -key 0x89c9d658351ff09f6507c089320a70302d94a462b1365d2e946af928caa80d39d87be29a7ec0429949391590595b6f9ccdf0675f20e9d91f5d534f8489949e1c</code></pre>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/3JOCq9E.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>now we need to convert this hexdump, I used cyberchef for this :</p></div>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/khDG7sK.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>finally I used <a href="https://github.com/ohyicong/decrypt-chrome-passwords" target="\_blank">decrypt-chrome-passwords</a> project to decrypt the password, few modifications are required like the path to login data database, and here is the flag :</p></div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>so our user can execute snap install using sudo without a password. At this point I started researching on how to create my own malicious snap package.</p></div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>First I found this awesome tutorial by ubuntu on creating essential files required for the snap package : <br> <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-your-first-snap#3-building-a-snap-is-easy">https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-your-first-snap#3-building-a-snap-is-easy</a></p></div>

Brief description</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>After this I started looking for ways to execute system commands from within the snap package and found the following snapcraft forum thread where a similar situation had been discussed : <br> <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/making-snap-of-a-bash-script/16486/12">https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/making-snap-of-a-bash-script/16486/12</a> <br> here is the final snapcraft.yaml file :</p></div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>In this process I also discovered a part of documentation which really helped in making sense of almost everything snap related : <br> <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-app-and-service-metadata"></a></p></div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>Finally after running snapcraft command as mentioned in the guide by ubuntu I successfully built a malicious snap package</p></div>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Challenge</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. There are also numeric palindromes, including date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11 and long digits 02/02/2020. Sentence-length palindromes ignore capitalization, punctuation, and word boundaries.</p></div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">Blacklisted Characters</h2>
<pre><code>;//--/</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>I started with a simple input "FLAG" and here is the output I received :</p></div>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/75HwFdy.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>So the javascript reverses our input and concatenates it with the original input and passes it through eval <br> Let's breakdown the javascript code :</p></div>
<pre><code>function random(){
return Math.random().toString(16).slice(2)
}
const KEY = random()</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>random function generates a random alphanumeric string and stores it in KEY</p></div>
<pre><code>function reverse(s){
return Array.from(s).reduce((acc, c) => c + acc, "")
}</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>reverse function simply reverses the characters of the input</p></div>
<pre><code>function mirror\_eval(s){
try {
return eval(s + reverse(s))
} catch (e){
console.log(e)
}
return null
}</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>mirror\_eval function passes our input concatenated with reverse of our input into eval</p></div>
<pre><code>function check(s){
const FLAG = `FLAG{${random()}}`
if (mirror\_eval(s) == KEY){
console.log(FLAG)
}
}</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>check function creates our flag using the random alphanumeric value generated in random function and then it checks if the result of mirror\_eval function is same as the value stored in the KEY, if it matches the flag is printed in the console. <br><br> eval evaluates or executes an argument, so for example if we pass "1+1" in eval we will get 2 as the result. Similarly eval can evaluate logical expressions as well. If you have noticed the blacklisted characters are specific and not every character is blacklisted. One of the logical operators is || i.e. logical OR. <br><br> Now lets solve the challenge, since the challenge reverses and concatenates our input if we input "KEY|" the result will be "KEY||YEK" which becomes a valid logical OR expression. <br><br> KEY is defined but YEK is not defined so technically we should get an error but thats not how OR in javascript works, here are few example :</p></div>
<div class="center-img"> <img class="responsive-img post-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/grnGxYY.png"> </div>
<div class="content white-text"><p>Here I have defined a variable KEY similar to our challenge and then some OR expressions. Notice lines 4, 5 and 6. In lines 4 and 5 the output is the first argument and in 6th line we can see YEK is not defined but no error was thrown and the result is the value of the first argument! <br><br> Now let's see if it works in our challenge :</p></div>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Windows Device Portal</h2>
<div class="content white-text"><p>The Windows Device Portal (WDP) is a web server included with Windows devices that lets you configure and manage the settings for the device over a network or USB connection (local connections are also supported on devices with a web browser).

<div class="content white-text"><p>The documentation also shows set up instructions for "Windows 10 IoT Dashboard". This discovery lead to another discovery, Windows 10 IoT Core, it is a trimmed down version of windows 10 which is optimized for smaller devices without a display and supports ARM/x86/x64 architectures. <br><br> Now I started looking for vulnerabilities and exploits for this OS and came across SirepRAT. <br><br> SirepRat exploits the Sirep Test Service that’s built in and running on the official images offered at Microsoft’s site. This service is the client part of the Hardware Lab Kit (HLK) setup one may build in order to perform driver/hardware tests on the IoT device. It serves the Sirep/WPCon/TShell protocol. <br><br> <a href="https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT/blob/master/docs/SirepRAT\_RCE\_as\_SYSTEM\_on\_Windows\_IoT\_Core\_Slides.pdf" target="\_blank">Read More</a><br><a href="https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT" target="\_blank">Download SirepRat</a> </p></div>

<pre><code>http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement</code></pre>
<div class="content white-text"><p>it says megahosting.htb instead of the IP address so I created a new entry for it in /etc/hosts file on my machine and after that I was able to access the page...</p></div>

<div class="content white-text"><p>at this point my goal was to extract some credentials, now I checked port 8080, it has tomcat running and if you know about apache tomcat you know there is a manager dashboard, if I can get tomcat manager credentials from directory traversal I can upload a reverse shell, now the apache page shows a path where user entries are stored so using that I formed this URL...</p></div>
<pre><code>http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml</code></pre>

<div class="content white-text"><p>Access Denied!!!! but it has provided an example for adding username and password entry into the xml file and when I compared it with what I got in the curl request it says "manager-script" instead of "manager-gui", I read about this role and found that tomcat provides a text api for manager role and it is enabled, after some more research I created a reverse shell upload script which uses text API to upload a malicious WAR file, this script can also be used outside HTB if you have working credentials and access to text API, you can download the script here : <a href="https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/warsend" target="\_blank">WARSend</a> .

<div class="content white-text">
<p>
There are many ways by which you can activate Windows 10, most of them involve usage of third party applications, they work but the problem is obtaining a clean, malware free copy of these softwares, specially for new users. We also know that evading an anti malware service is not that hard so the best way to protect yourself from these softwares packed with malware is to not use them whenever it is possible. So I am providing step-by-step instructions on how to activate windows 10 without any 3rd party softwares using KMS. These step can be used to activate any build of windows 10. If you have a laptop that comes with windows pre-installed then it can be a bit problematic as they store OEM license key in the BIOS. This process may not work directly in such cases.
</p>
</div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">What is KMS?</h2>
<div class="content white-text">
<p>
The Key Management Service (KMS) is an activation service that allows organizations to activate systems within their own network, eliminating the need for individual computers to connect to Microsoft for product activation. It does not require a dedicated system and can be easily co-hosted on a system that provides other services.

</div>
<h2 class="cyan-text">What is a KMS Host Key?</h2>
<div class="content white-text">
<p>
A KMS Key is used to activate the KMS host computer with a Microsoft activation server and can activate up to six KMS hosts with 10 activations per host. Each KMS host can activate an unlimited number of computers.
</p>

<div class="content white-text">

## Firmware

A firmware update can resolve issues that the previous firmware version may have and improve its current performance.

## To Upgrade

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent upgrade failures, please read the following before proceeding with the upgrade process

* **Please upgrade firmware from the local TP-Link official website of the purchase location for your TP-Link device, otherwise it will be against the warranty. Please click [here](/choose-your-location/) to change site if necessary.**
* Please verify the hardware version of your device for the firmware version. Wrong firmware upgrade may damage your device and void the warranty.
* **Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, as it may cause permanent damage to the product.**
* To avoid wireless disconnect issue during firmware upgrade process, it's recommended to upload firmware with wired connection unless there is no LAN/Ethernet port on your TP-Link device.
* It's recommended that users stop all Internet applications on the computer, or simply disconnect Internet line from the device before the upgrade.
* Use decompression software such as WinZIP or WinRAR to extract the file you download before the upgrade.

# CVE-2020-9375 TP-Link Archer C50 v3 Denial of Service

TP-Link Archer C50 is a popular router on Amazon.in with over 7K reviews and ratings and it is marked as Amazon's Choice!

Vulnerability : The Web Interface in Archer C50 V3 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service when anyone in network sends a specially crafted HTTP Header containing an unexpected Referer field.

Type of Vulnerability : Denial of Service

Device : TP-Link Archer C50 V3

CVE : [CVE-2020-9375](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9375)

CVE Status : Assigned

Discovered By : Lohitya Pushkar

Vulnerable Version : Build 171227 and below

Patch : Available! [Build 200218](https://www.tp-link.com/in/support/download/archer-c50/v3/#Firmware)

## Attacking Setup

Connected with the router through WiFi/LAN

Operating System : Arch Linux 5.4.13-arch1-1 x86\_64

## Exploit

Let’s verify if we can access the gateway and port 80 is open

![CVE-2020-9375 TP-Link Archer C50 v3 Denial of Service](https://imgur.com/KtDFDPY.png)

As we can see port 80 is open and we can access router login page.
Now we will create a new text file, I used headers.txt as file name for this step, in this file we will input the headers we want to send with the request we will be making later on

![CVE-2020-9375 TP-Link Archer C50 v3 Denial of Service](https://imgur.com/7l1nkUs.png)

I am using Host, User-Agent and Referer in headers, Host and User-Agent are in standard format and are correct but take a look at Referer, the correct format of Referer field is as shown below :

```
Referer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
```
This is the point where the vulnerability is triggered, if we send Referer in incorrect format, the service on port 80 crashes and the port closes.

Now let’s try to trigger this vulnerability using curl, we will issue a simple GET request with the command below, to provide headers we will use -H argument of curl and specify our file which contains header i.e. headers.txt

![CVE-2020-9375 TP-Link Archer C50 v3 Denial of Service](https://imgur.com/NQf1cgH.png)

In a normal scenario we get a status code along with the output of GET request but here we get Empty reply from server, which means the service crashed before it could reply and the connection was closed, now let’s check nmap again to see if port 80 is still open

![CVE-2020-9375 TP-Link Archer C50 v3 Denial of Service](https://imgur.com/MxL7zNA.png)

And the port is closed, our exploit was successful and it resulted in a Denial of Service as the web interface cannot be accessed now until we reboot the router manually.

Similarly we can make a custom script and automate the whole process making it easy and fast, an example is shown below
