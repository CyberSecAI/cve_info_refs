Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2020-9337:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Golf Buddy Course Manager Software Version 1.1 transmits passwords to the server encoded in Base64.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure password transmission: Using Base64 encoding for passwords does not provide sufficient protection, as it's easily reversible. Base64 is an encoding scheme, not an encryption method, and it does not hide data from someone who can capture the transmission.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of user passwords: If an attacker can monitor network traffic, they can decode the Base64-encoded password and gain access to the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network monitoring/packet sniffing: An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the Golf Buddy software and the server. This could be through a compromised router, a man-in-the-middle attack, or by having access to the same network as the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to monitor network traffic: The attacker needs to be able to capture the network traffic generated by the Golf Buddy software.
- Basic knowledge of Base64 decoding: The attacker needs to be able to decode the Base64-encoded data to obtain the password.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the software is version 1.1.
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper encryption or hashing of the password data prior to transmission.
