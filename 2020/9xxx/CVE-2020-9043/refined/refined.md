The provided content relates to CVE-2020-9043.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the disclosure of the wpCentral connection key. This key is used for authentication and communication between the wpCentral plugin and the central management service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the insecure handling and potential exposure of the connection key. The code changes indicate that the key was being displayed in a way that could be accessed by unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
If the connection key is compromised, attackers could gain unauthorized access to manage and control WordPress sites connected through wpCentral. This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including:

-   Website defacement
-   Data theft
-   Malware injection
-   Complete site takeover

**Attack Vectors:**
The specific attack vector is not detailed, but based on the code changes, it seems the connection key was being displayed in a plugin's meta data within the admin panel. This is exposed in the plugin listing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin panel where the plugin list is displayed.
- The attacker would likely need to be able to view the plugin meta data.
