- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe Character Animator.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not specify the exact attack vector, but states that the vulnerability could lead to remote code execution, implying a network or file-based attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need the ability to trigger the vulnerable code to cause a stack buffer overflow. The document indicates that the vulnerability could lead to remote code execution, suggesting the attack could be conducted remotely.
