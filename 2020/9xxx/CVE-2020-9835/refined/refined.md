**CVE-2020-9835**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An issue existed in the pausing of FaceTime video.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  The user's video may not be paused in a FaceTime call if they exit the FaceTime app while the call is ringing.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** A user's video might continue to transmit even after they leave the FaceTime app.
*   **Attack vectors:**  The user would need to be in an active FaceTime call that is still ringing and exit the app at the right moment.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to call a target using FaceTime and then rely on the target leaving the app at the right time during ringing.
