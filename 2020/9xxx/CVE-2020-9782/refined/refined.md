- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A parsing issue in the handling of directory paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper path validation in Notes application when parsing directory paths
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can overwrite existing files.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The specifics of how the malicious directory paths are introduced are not provided in this document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted input to the Notes application that contains malicious directory paths. The attacker does not need to be local.
