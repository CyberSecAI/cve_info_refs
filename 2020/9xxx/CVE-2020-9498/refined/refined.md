Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Apache Guacamole's `guacd` process handles RDP static virtual channel data. Specifically, it mishandles pointers when processing fragmented messages received through these channels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Dangling Pointer/Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a dangling pointer. When a fragmented message is processed, a stream object is allocated to assemble the complete message. After the message is processed, this stream object is freed, but the pointer to this memory location is not set to NULL, resulting in a dangling pointer. Subsequent fragments sent without the "first fragment" flag will then attempt to use this freed memory, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Arbitrary Write:** Due to the nature of how `wStream` objects are handled, the use-after-free vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary write capabilities if the pointer field is modified.
- **Information Disclosure:**  While not directly part of CVE-2020-9498, related vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-9497 and others) in the same code base allow for memory content to be leaked to either the attacker (malicious RDP server) or the user, which could be used to bypass ASLR.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the use-after-free and arbitrary write, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the `guacd` process. This process handles a single connection initially but is the base for Privilege Escalation.
- **Privilege Escalation (PE):** Since `guacd` uses `fork()` without `execve()`, child processes inherit the entire memory space of their parent. This enables an attacker to steal active connection UUIDs from the parent's memory space (proc-map), allowing them to join all active connections and take control of all sessions being proxied by the gateway. The attacker can then monitor all incoming sessions, record credentials, and initiate new sessions, effectively gaining full control of the organization's network.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the process's memory space.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious RDP Server:** An attacker compromises a machine on the internal network that acts as an RDP server.
- **Reverse RDP Attack:** The attacker leverages a vulnerability in how the Guacamole server handles RDP connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromised RDP Server:** The attacker must control or have compromised an RDP server that a user might connect to through Guacamole.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker must be able to establish an RDP connection with a user through the Guacamole server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit does not require client interaction.
- The vulnerability exists in the server-side components of Guacamole.
- The issue has been fixed in Guacamole Server version 1.2.0.
