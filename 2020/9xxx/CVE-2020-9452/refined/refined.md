Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `anti_ransomware_service.exe` in Acronis True Image 2020 using SYSTEM privileges to copy files to a quarantine folder. This copy operation can be manipulated by an unprivileged user by creating a hardlink within the quarantine folder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Handling:** The service copies files to the quarantine folder without properly validating the destination, allowing for the use of hard links to redirect the write operation.
*   **Privileged File Write with User-Controlled Path:** The `anti_ransomware_service.exe` performs a privileged file write operation (using SYSTEM privileges), while the destination of the write is influenced by an unprivileged user.
*  **REST API Exposure:** The service exposes a REST API that can be used to force the file move to the quarantine folder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An unprivileged user can overwrite arbitrary files in the file system with arbitrary content. This is because by using a hardlink, the user can control the destination path where the privileged process will write the content of the "ransomware" file.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Overwriting system files with arbitrary content allows an attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Hardlink Manipulation:** An attacker creates a hard link inside the quarantine folder, pointing to the target file they wish to overwrite.
*   **REST API Trigger:** The attacker uses the REST API of `anti_ransomware_service.exe` to trigger the file copy operation to the quarantine folder, causing the arbitrary file overwrite through the hard link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where Acronis True Image 2020 is installed.
*   **Unprivileged User Account:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability using an unprivileged user account.
*   **Ability to Create Hard Links:** The attacker needs the ability to create hard links on the file system.
*   **Access to REST API:** The attacker needs to be able to access the REST API of the `anti_ransomware_service.exe`.

**Additional Details**

*   The quarantine feature is not enabled by default, but it can be forced through the REST API, making exploitation possible even if the feature is not actively used.
*   The provided proof-of-concept code includes a ransomware simulator, a python script that makes the REST API call, and a tool to create the symbolic link.
*   The exploit involves creating a hard link inside the quarantine folder, tricking the service into writing the "ransomware" file into an arbitrary location.
