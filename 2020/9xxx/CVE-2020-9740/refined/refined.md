Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-9740:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript can be injected and stored within the application. This script is then executed in the browser of other users when they access the affected content/page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution in the browser: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Exfiltrating sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into a persistent location within the application, which is then executed when users interact with the stored code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious script into the application. This may require specific user privileges or exploitation of another vulnerability allowing data injection.
- An attacker does not require direct interaction with the target user. The user needs to interact with the compromised application to have the malicious code executed in their browser.

**Affected Versions:**
- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.5.5.0 and earlier versions
- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.4.8.1 and earlier versions
- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.3.3.8 and earlier versions
- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.2 SP1-CFP20 and earlier versions
