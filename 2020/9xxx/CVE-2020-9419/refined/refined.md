The provided content is a markdown document detailing vulnerabilities found in Arcadyan routers, specifically models like VRV9506JAC23. It mentions two CVEs, one of them being CVE-2020-9419.

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root cause:** Lack of input validation in the web interface of the Arcadyan router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The web interface allows users to input data without proper sanitization or validation, which enables the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious code can be persistently injected into the router's web interface.
- This can allow an attacker to perform actions in the context of the logged-in user, potentially leading to further compromise of the device or network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface.
- If combined with CVE-2020-9420 (cleartext transmission of credentials), an attacker can gain initial access to the web interface using sniffed credentials.
- Then, they can inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Initial access to the router's web interface, which can be achieved by:
  -  Being on the same network as the router.
  -  Using credentials obtained through sniffing the network (in combination with CVE-2020-9420).
- Ability to inject malicious scripts into input fields present in the router's web interface.

The document also mentions that this vulnerability is likely present in other Arcadyan models, due to similar web interfaces and common features. Additionally, it notes that these devices are deployed by major ISPs in several countries, making this a widespread vulnerability.
