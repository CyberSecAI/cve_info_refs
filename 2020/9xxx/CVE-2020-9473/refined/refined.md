Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9473:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided text directly mentions "CVE-2020-9473: The S. Siedle & Soehne SG 150-0 Smart Gateway before 1.2.4 has a passwordless ftp ssh user." This aligns with the official description of CVE-2020-9473 which states "The S. Siedle & Soehne SG 150-0 Smart Gateway before 1.2.4 has a passwordless ftp ssh user. By using an exploit chain, an attacker with access to the network can get root access on the gateway." Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the presence of a default configuration in the S. Siedle & Soehne SG 150-0 Smart Gateway firmware versions prior to 1.2.4, which allows FTP access with a user that has no password.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Passwordless FTP/SSH User:** The primary vulnerability is the existence of an FTP and SSH user account that does not require a password.
    *   **Exploit Chain:** The identified passwordless user account is the first step in a chain of exploits used by the researchers to obtain root access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Root Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker root-level access on the gateway device.
    *   **Physical Access Control:** With root access, attackers can manipulate the gateway system to gain unauthorized physical access by opening connected doors. They can also lock out authorized users.
    *   **Full Control of Device:** Root access also allows complete control over the device, enabling the attacker to modify configurations and use the gateway for further malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through network access to the gateway. An attacker must be on the same network as the Siedle device or have network access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable device through the network.
    *   **Exploitation Skills:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities to exploit the device.

**3. Additional Details Beyond CVE Description:**

The provided content includes more technical details than the basic CVE description:

*   **Specific Exploit Steps:** It outlines the steps taken to chain the passwordless user with other vulnerabilities, including accessing the internal MySQL database, adding a user with admin privileges to the web application, uploading a modified firmware backup via the web interface, creating a new SSH key, and exploiting a race condition in the logrotate script to achieve root access.
*   **Compromise of Administrative Web GUI:** It specifies that the attacker gains access not only to the device itself but also to its administrative web interface through the aforementioned steps.
*   **Detailed Exploitation of logrotate race condition:** The research provides the method of exploiting the logrotate script, which involves binding the MySQL port using a crafted program, then using the logrotate script to create a symlink to the exploit payload and then gaining root with a final crafted payload.

In summary, this content confirms the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9473 and provides a detailed explanation of how the passwordless FTP user account is exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve root access on the Siedle SG 150-0 Smart Gateway and its related web GUI.
