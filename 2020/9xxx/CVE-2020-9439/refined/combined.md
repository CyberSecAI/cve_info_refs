Known Issues:

* The Course Report uses a custom Uncanny Owl query that shows “In Progress” for users that have completed any activity in a course, such as a quiz. The User Report uses LearnDash functions that only return “In Progress” if the user has completed a lesson or topic. This means that “In Progress” vs. “Not Started” numbers may be inconsistent between the Course Report and User Report in the rare instance that a user has completed a quiz or other course activity but not completed any lessons or topics.
