- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-Bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but it is related to how Adobe After Effects processes certain data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to provide crafted input that triggers the out-of-bounds write condition within the After Effects application. This implies the attacker would need to be able to get the user to open a malicious file or trigger the vulnerability using some other method within the application.
