- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation within the Huawei device software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect input validation logic leading to out-of-bounds memory access and modification.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation may lead to abnormal service behavior, potentially causing crashes or other service disruptions. The attacker can access and modify the memory of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the affected device. An attacker needs to have physical or remote access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the device and be able to perform a series of operations that exploit the vulnerability. CVSS score indicates high privileges (PR:H) are needed and user interaction is required (UI:R).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by incorrect input validation logic.
- The vendor has released software updates to address the issue.
- The vulnerability was reported to Huawei PSIRT by 360 Alpha Lab.
