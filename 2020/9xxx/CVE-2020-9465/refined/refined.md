Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-9465:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `eonweb/include/classes/Translator.class.php` file. Specifically, the application directly uses the value of the `user_id` cookie in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `user_id` cookie. The code directly inserts the cookie value into a SQL query:
  ```php
  if(isset($_COOKIE['user_id'])){
  		$lang = mysqli_result(sqlrequest($database_eonweb,"select user_language from users where user_id='".$_COOKIE['user_id']."'"),0);
  }
  ```
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `user_id` cookie before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `user_id` cookie.
- This could lead to:
    - **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining administrative privileges by retrieving admin session IDs or dumping user tables.
    - **Data Breaches:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive user data (e.g., usernames, passwords, etc.).
    - **Denial of Service:** Injecting SQL that causes the database server to become unresponsive (e.g., using `sleep()` function).
    - **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `user_id` cookie. An attacker crafts a malicious cookie value containing SQL injection payloads and sends it to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability on the `index.php`, `login.php` and `logout.php` pages.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with a manipulated `user_id` cookie.

**Additional details from content:**
- The vulnerability is present in EON versions 5.1, 5.2 (likely), and 5.3.
- The provided example demonstrates the injection using a `sleep()` function to cause a delay in the server's response, verifying the SQL injection.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `e541116` which is associated with the release 5.3-3.
