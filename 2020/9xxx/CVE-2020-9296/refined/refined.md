- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of Java EL expressions within custom constraint violation error messages in Netflix Titus. Specifically, the `ConstraintValidatorContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate()` method, when used with unsanitized user-controlled input, allows for arbitrary Java code execution via EL injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI): The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious EL expressions into the error message template.
    - Unsanitized user input: The vulnerability occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided data before using it in EL expressions.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary Java code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Injecting arbitrary data into the error message template being passed to `ConstraintValidatorContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate()`

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary data in the error message template which is passed to the vulnerable method.
