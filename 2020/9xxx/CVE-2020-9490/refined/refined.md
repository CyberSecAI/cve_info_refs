Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9490:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in an HTTP/2 request can cause a crash when the server attempts to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource. The root cause is related to memory management and concurrent access in the HTTP/2 module when processing the crafted 'Cache-Digest' header, which causes a crash in the process when an HTTP/2 push is initiated. The issue arises during memory allocation and management, particularly when debug/trace logging is enabled for the HTTP/2 module, which exposes a race condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a server process crash via a specially crafted HTTP/2 request, leading to denial of service.
*  **Memory Corruption**: A crafted Cache-Digest header can trigger an issue in memory pools causing concurrent use and corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the server process, causing a denial of service and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** In some scenarios related to memory corruption, it could potentially lead to resource exhaustion by triggering excessive allocations, although the main impact is the crash itself.
*   **Data disclosure:** There is a potential for exposure of some uninitialized memory due to the way mod\_auth\_digest handles values

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via an HTTP/2 request.
*   **Specifically Crafted Header:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted "Cache-Digest" header.
*   **HTTP/2 PUSH:** The crash is triggered when the server tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource after receiving the malicious header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the targeted server.
*   **HTTP/2 Support:** The server needs to have HTTP/2 support enabled.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerability:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the "Cache-Digest" header vulnerability in the HTTP/2 implementation.
* **Debug/trace logging enabled**: Logging statements are made on the wrong connection which causes concurrent use of memory pools.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by disabling the HTTP/2 PUSH feature via configuration setting "H2Push off".
*  Some of the data indicates that enabling debug/trace for the HTTP/2 module is required for exploitation.
* The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive, which allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers leading to eventual memory exhaustion, but this is related to another vulnerability (CVE-2016-8740) and not the cause of the crash for CVE-2020-9490.

The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description, especially regarding the specific conditions that trigger the crash (HTTP/2 push, specially crafted Cache-Digest), which modules/configurations are affected, and specific mitigation methods.
