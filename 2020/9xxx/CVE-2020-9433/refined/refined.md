The provided content is a commit diff for the lua-openssl project, specifically addressing a security issue identified as GSL-2020-026. It appears to be related to how the `X509_check_host`, `X509_check_email`, and `X509_check_ip` functions from OpenSSL are used in the Lua binding.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The original code for `openssl_x509_check_host`, `openssl_x509_check_email`, and `openssl_x509_check_ip` functions was not correctly handling the return values from the respective OpenSSL functions. It only returned a boolean value indicating success or failure without providing detailed information about the reason for failure. Also, it appears that the length parameter wasn't properly handled, and the allocated memory for peer names wasn't being freed which caused a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Lack of detailed error information**: The original code would only return a simple boolean, which could mask important error details such as "internal error" or "malformed input."
2. **Memory leak**: The original code didn't free the allocated memory for the peer name.
3.  **Improper string length handling**: The functions were not correctly passing the length of the hostname, email or ip address to the underlying OpenSSL functions, relying instead on strlen().

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially provide specially crafted hostnames, email addresses, or IP addresses that could lead to incorrect validation results. This could allow an attacker to bypass certificate validation checks, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security issues. The lack of proper error information could also make it difficult to diagnose issues when these checks fail.
The memory leak would cause a program to eventually run out of memory.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker needs to control the input to the Lua functions `openssl_x509_check_host`, `openssl_x509_check_email` or `openssl_x509_check_ip`.
This might involve injecting malicious data via a network connection or other external interfaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker needs to be able to influence the data that's being passed to the vulnerable `lua-openssl` functions. This may require some degree of access to the application using the library.

**Fix:**

The commit changes the functions `openssl_x509_check_host`, `openssl_x509_check_email` and `openssl_x509_check_ip` to use `luaL_checklstring` to properly obtain the input string and it's length. It also calls `X509_check_host`, `X509_check_email` and `X509_check_ip` with the length, and it utilizes a helper function `openssl_push_check_result` to handle the return values and push them onto the Lua stack, and frees the `peer` memory after use.
The helper function pushes a boolean `true` for a successful match, `false` for a failed match, and `nil` plus an error string (either "internal" or "malformed") if the OpenSSL functions return an error.

In summary, this commit addresses the issues by properly handling return values from OpenSSL functions, correctly handling string lengths, and preventing memory leaks. This ensures more robust certificate validation in Lua applications.
