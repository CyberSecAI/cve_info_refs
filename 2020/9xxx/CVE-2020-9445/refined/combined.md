# Zulip server 2.1.3 security release

  [![](/_astro/tabbott.Y0j5haym_Z1qaMxj.webp)](author/tabbott/)  [Tim Abbott](author/tabbott/)   Apr 1, 2020 • 2 min read

We released Zulip Server 2.1.3 today. This is a security release, containing a
few dozen cherry-picked changes since Zulip 2.1.2.

## What’s new

This releases fixes several important bugs in previous versions of Zulip. It
contains fixes for the following issues:

* CVE-2020-9444: Reverse tabnabbing vulnerability in Zulip markdown.
* CVE-2020-9445: XSS vulnerability in modal\_link markdown feature. This was
  resolved by removing this markdown feature, which hasn’t been used in years.
* CVE-2020-10935: XSS vulnerability in markdown link processing.
* Blocked access from Zulip Desktop versions below 5.0.0 due to
  [security issues with older releases](2020/04/01/zulip-desktop-5-0-0-security-release/).
  While most clients have already automatically upgraded, you can adjust
  `DESKTOP_MINIMUM_VERSION` and `DESKTOP_WARNING_VERSION` in `version.py` (and
  then restart the server) if you want to adjust this policy.
* Restructured server initialization to simplify initialization of Docker
  containers (eliminating common classes of user error).
* Removed buggy feedback bot (the `ENABLE_FEEDBACK` setting).
* Migrated GitHub authentication to use their latest OAuth authentication
  interface.
* Fixed support for restoring a backup on a different minor release (in the
  common case in which they have the same database schema).
* Fixed restoring backups with memcached authentication enabled.
* Fixed image alt tags appearing before preview content (preheaders) for many
  emails.
* Fixed buggy text in missed-message emails with PM content disabled.
* Fixed buggy loading spinner in “emoji format” widget.
* Fixed incoming webhook support for AWX 9.x.y.
* Fixed a couple missing translation tags.
* Fixed “User groups” settings UI bug for administrators.
* Fixed error handling for Slack data import.
* Fixed data import tool to reset resource limits after importing data from a
  free plan organization on zulipchat.com.
* Changed the SAML default signature algorithm to SHA-256, overriding

  the SHA-1 default used by python3-saml.
* Added an integration for Prometheus AlertManager.
