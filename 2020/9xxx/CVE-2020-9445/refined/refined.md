- **Root cause of vulnerability**: XSS vulnerability in the `modal_link` markdown feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious `modal_link` markdown element.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject markdown content that is then processed and rendered by the Zulip application.

**Additional details**:
- The `modal_link` markdown feature was removed to resolve the vulnerability, indicating that the feature itself was the source of the XSS risk.
- The vulnerability was reported by Matt Austin.
- The blog post indicates that the feature was not in use for years, which is why it was safe to remove it.
