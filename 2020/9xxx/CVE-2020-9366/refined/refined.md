Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9366:

**Root Cause:**

- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in GNU Screen due to improper handling of the special escape sequence OSC 49. Specifically, the code divides the escape sequence number (49) by 10 and uses the result (4) as an index into the `w_xtermosc` array. This array had a size of 4, leading to an out-of-bounds access when the index is 4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write to the `w_xtermosc` array. This array is used to store special xterm/rxvt escapes. The code attempts to write to an index beyond the allocated memory for this array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory corruption:** A remote attacker can cause memory corruption by sending a specially crafted string containing the malicious escape sequence to a GNU Screen window.
- **Unspecified Impact:** The memory corruption could lead to various unspecified consequences, potentially including crashes, denial of service, or, possibly, arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote attack:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted string to a GNU Screen window. This could occur over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted string of characters to a GNU Screen window.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but they must have a way to send data to the screen instance of a vulnerable version.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present at least since version 4.2.0.
- The vulnerability is exposed in builds using the `--enable-rxvt_osc` option.
- Most distributions enable the rxvt_osc option by default, making them vulnerable.
- The fix involves increasing the size of the `w_xtermosc` array to 5 and the length of the OSC to 2560.
