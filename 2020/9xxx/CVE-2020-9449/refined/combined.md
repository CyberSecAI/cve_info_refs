* WS Pro/AX Pro: fixed not displaying the geo map with users when behind Cloudflare

**2024-Oct-25** (24.10: BlaB! AX / BlaB! WS / BlaB! AX Pro / BlaB! WS Pro)

**2024-Apr-21** (24.04: BlaB! AX / BlaB! WS / BlaB! AX Pro / BlaB! WS Pro)

* AX/WS Pro only: **Facebook Login** is now deprecated!

Facebook's recent requirement for app owners to prove with documentation that they own a legal business in their country of residence has led us to discontinue the "Login with Facebook" feature. It will continue to work until some change by FB breaks it. If you have users who are actively using it, we recommend you to setup a welcome message with instructions on how to self delete and forget, then create a normal password protected account using the same username.
