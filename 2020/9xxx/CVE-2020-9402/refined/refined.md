Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-9402:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize input when using GIS functions and aggregates with the Oracle database backend within the Django web framework. Specifically, the `tolerance` parameter is not adequately sanitized, which leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where a malicious user can inject arbitrary SQL code through the `tolerance` parameter.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input before it's used in SQL queries.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** A successful SQL injection attack could expose sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification/Addition:** Attackers could modify existing data or insert malicious data into the database.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting malicious SQL queries, an attacker could cause the database to become unresponsive, leading to a DoS condition.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The ability to manipulate SQL queries might enable an attacker to elevate their privileges within the system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, allowing an attacker to target affected systems over a network.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attack vector is the `tolerance` parameter within GIS functions and aggregates, where the attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Oracle Database Backend:** The vulnerability specifically exists when using the Oracle database backend with Django.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Django web application.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the `tolerance` parameter of GIS functions or aggregates when using the Oracle database backend.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Systems:**
    *   The vulnerability was found to affect several NetApp products that incorporate vulnerable versions of Django.
    *   Debian LTS identified the affected `python-django` package in Debian 9 "Stretch".
    *   Ubuntu identified `python-django` and `python3-django` packages as vulnerable in Ubuntu 19.10, 18.04 ESM and 16.04 ESM.
    *   Fedora 31 is also listed as affected.
    *   RedHat lists affected versions for `python-django` and `python-django16` packages.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   The primary mitigation is to upgrade to the patched versions of Django which properly sanitize the input.
    *   NetApp indicates that for specific products where the vulnerable functionality is not used, the impact was reduced to low.

*   **Versions:**
    *   Django versions 1.11 prior to 1.11.29, 2.2 prior to 2.2.11, and 3.0 prior to 3.0.4 were identified as vulnerable.
    *   Patched versions are 1:1.10.7-2+deb9u17 for Debian 9, 1:1.11.22-1ubuntu1.3 for Ubuntu 19.10, 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.8 for Ubuntu 18.04, 1.8.7-1ubuntu5.12 for Ubuntu 16.04, 2.2.13-1.fc31 for Fedora 31.

*   **Upstream Fixes:** Commits from Django developers for 3.0, 2.2 and 1.11 branches, which implement the patch have been added.

*   **NetApp Specific:** NetApp acknowledges the vulnerability in their products, particularly in "NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage" with no plan to fix it (End Of Availability), but some of their other products containing the vulnerable code did not require patching.

*   **Resolution:** Upgrading `python-django` packages to the versions specified in the advisories is the recommended solution.

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `tolerance` parameter, allowing SQL injection. This could be exploited by remote attackers, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, DoS, or privilege escalation.
