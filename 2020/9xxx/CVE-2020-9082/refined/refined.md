Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a logic judging error within the system under specific scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The system fails to properly handle certain conditions, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to certain information from applications protected by Applock.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute commands in ADB (Android Debug Bridge) mode.
- The attacker needs to perform a series of specific operations on the phone to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have gained permission to execute commands in ADB mode. This likely implies they have either physical access to the device with USB debugging enabled or have compromised the device sufficiently to remotely enable ADB.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific sequence of actions to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as HWPSIRT-2019-07112 internally at Huawei.
- The identified affected product is HUAWEI Mate 20 with versions earlier than 10.1.0.160(C00).
