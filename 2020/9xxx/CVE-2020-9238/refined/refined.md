- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A function within a module of Huawei smartphones does not sufficiently validate input data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific request which could compromise normal device service, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specific request to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers require access to the affected product, which is a Huawei smartphone, and the ability to send crafted requests.
