We believe that you shouldn’t have to hire a developer to create a great WordPress gallery. That’s why we built [Envira](http://enviragallery.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion "Envira"), a drag & drop **photo gallery plugin** that’s both EASY, FAST and POWERFUL.

Envira Gallery is highly optimized for web and server performance because we understand the importance of speed when it comes to SEO and conversion.

Our free photo gallery plugin works great with the top page builders including: Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, as well as the block editor.

> **Envira Pro**
>
> Photo Gallery by Envira is the lite version of the popular Envira Pro plugin that comes with all the features you will ever need including albums, tags, social media integration, gallery templates / gallery layouts, deeplinking, pagination, e-commerce, image proofing, and tons more. [Click here to purchase Envira Pro now!](http://enviragallery.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion "Envira")

**Envira Gallery** has been downloaded over 5,000,000+ times. Here’s why smart photographers, designers, and developers love Envira, and you will too!

#### Drag & Drop Photo Gallery Builder

We were tired with the bloated and buggy gallery widgets and plugins. That’s why we built Envira to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create an amazing gallery in minutes. By using our easy to use [drag and drop builder](http://enviragallery.com/features/drag-drop-builder/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion), you can upload your photos, rearrange them, and create an image gallery in 5 minutes or less.

You can also add gallery blocks built for the block editor with only a few clicks.

> The trick to making difficult things easy is to keep the easy things still easy. **Envira makes everything easy.** If you’ve struggled with WordPress gallery plugins that take video tutorials to learn, you’re going to love Envira.
>
> Chris Lema – WordPress Blogger and Speaker

#### Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed

Envira Gallery is 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed for your website visitors.

Plus, you have the ability for meta data, deeplinks, standalone galleries, and pagination.

#### Sharing and Selling Photos Made EASY

Social media integrations, image proofing, and WooCommerce store integration.

> Not only is Envira **exceptionally well built** behind the scenes, it’s also exceptionally easy to use. It’s perfect for those who really want to get things done.
>
> Pippin Williamson – WordPress Core Contributor and founder of EasyDigitalDownloads

#### Easy to Customize and Extend

You can easily customize with our built-in WordPress templates and layouts or create your own.

But we also knew that our developer friends may want to extend it further. That’s why Envira comes with tons of hooks and filters (and yes it’s all very-well documented).

> Most WordPress gallery options are either too basic or require a PhD to figure out. For my clients, I need something that is easy to use yet powerful. Envira is the answer. Its straight forward approach means it is a breeze for my clients to quickly create galleries. Nevertheless, with the API and documentation available, it also allows developers to make customizations and extend functionality when necessary. Simply put, **Envira is a great tool** for everyone’s tool chest.
