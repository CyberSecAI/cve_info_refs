The provided content describes a vulnerability in F-Secure products related to the parsing of GZIP archives.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the parsing engine handles GZIP archives. By manipulating the compression method of a GZIP archive, an attacker can bypass the AV engine while still allowing the user to extract the file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper parsing of GZIP archives, allowing for manipulation of the compression method
- Failure of the AV engine to scan manipulated GZIP archives

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Files can pass through gateway products (email, HTTP proxy) without being scanned
- Server-side AV software will fail to detect malicious code within the manipulated GZIP archive
- Attackers can hide implants or exfiltration/pivot servers

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating the compression method within a GZIP archive

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify GZIP archives
- The attacker needs to deliver the crafted archive through a channel that will be scanned by the vulnerable F-Secure product, such as email or HTTP traffic.

**Affected Products:**
- F-Secure Email and Server Security
- F-Secure Internet GateKeeper
- F-SECURE CLOUD PROTECTION FOR SALESFORCE
- Linux versions below 17.0.605.474

**Patch Information:**
- Unix version (IGK) fixed in library version 17.0.605.474 (released January 20th)
- Windows version already patched in December 2019
