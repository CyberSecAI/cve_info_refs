```
{
  "ID": "CVE-2020-9281",
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of 'protected' comments within the HTML Data Processor of the CKEditor, allowing malicious code to be injected.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could inject arbitrary web script into a CKEditor, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on a website, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the page.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "An attacker crafts malicious HTML code containing a protected comment and persuades a victim to switch CKEditor to source mode and paste the malicious code. Then, the victim switches back to WYSIWYG mode.",
    "Alternatively, an attacker can persuade a victim to copy the crafted HTML and paste it into CKEditor in WYSIWYG mode."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "The attacker needs to create malicious HTML code containing a specially crafted 'protected' comment.",
    "The attacker needs to persuade the victim to interact with the malicious code through either switching to source mode and pasting, or pasting directly into WYSIWYG mode."
  ]
