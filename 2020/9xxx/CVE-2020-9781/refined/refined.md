- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in Safari's handling of website permission prompts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows a user to grant website permissions to a site they didn't intend to, because the prompts are not cleared after navigation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user might inadvertently grant a website unintended access to resources or functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick the user into interacting with a website in a specific way that leverages the logic flaw in the permission prompt handling.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to present the victim with a malicious website that triggers the flaw during navigation.
