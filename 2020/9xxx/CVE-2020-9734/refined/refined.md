- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored and later executed in the browsers of other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored persistently in the application (likely in the database or some other persistent data store).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code into the AEM application's data store. This usually requires some level of access or ability to interact with the application.
