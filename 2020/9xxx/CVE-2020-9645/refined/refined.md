Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-9645:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs. The "Blind" aspect means the attacker might not get direct feedback from the server's response, but can still observe side effects like network traffic or data exfiltration.

**Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive information disclosure. This indicates that an attacker could potentially use the SSRF vulnerability to access internal resources, retrieve sensitive data, or probe the internal network infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**  By manipulating the requests sent by the AEM server, attackers can control the destination URL of the requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to influence the server's request generation to inject their malicious target URLs into the request.  This would typically involve exploiting input parameters in web requests, or by some other means controlling the data used by AEM when it creates its own requests.

**Affected versions:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) versions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is classified as "Important" by Adobe.
* The vulnerability was reported by Dmitry Muntyanov.
* Fixes are available in Cumulative Fix Pack 6.4.8.1 and Service Pack 6.5.5.0.
