- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application doesn't limit the number of opened web sockets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted resource consumption (specifically, web socket connections) leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can crash the web API, rendering it unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can cause a victim to visit a website under the attacker's control. This website can then open a large number of websocket connections to the vulnerable API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website or otherwise cause a victim's browser to connect to the vulnerable API. No authentication or privileged access is needed.
