  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The S. Siedle & Soehne SG 150-0 Smart Gateway before 1.2.4 allows remote code execution via the backup functionality in the web frontend.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authenticated remote code execution via the backup functionality in the web frontend.",
      "The backup file is a squashfs image containing a backup.sql file that can be modified to inject commands during the restore process."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker with network access to gain root access on the gateway, which enables control of connected doors and devices.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web frontend of the S. Siedle & Soehne SG 150-0 Smart Gateway.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires access to the network and must be able to authenticate to the web frontend of the gateway."
