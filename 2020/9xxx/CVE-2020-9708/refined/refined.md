Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `resolveRepositoryPath` function in the `git-server` application does not properly validate user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of input validation allows a malicious user to traverse the file system to arbitrary Git repositories outside the intended `repoRoot` directory. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Private Repositories:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to potentially access private Git repositories by traversing to their location, if the attacker is able to determine or guess that location. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive code and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `resolveRepositoryPath` function, where the vulnerability resides. By manipulating user input passed to this function, an attacker can initiate the path traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user capable of interacting with the vulnerable `git-server` application.
*   The attacker needs to have some knowledge or be able to guess/brute-force the path to the target Git repository.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered High severity.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in `git-server` version 1.3.1.
*   There are no known workarounds other than upgrading to the patched version.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GHSL team member Jaroslav Lobaƒçevski ([@JarLob](https://github.com/JarLob)).
