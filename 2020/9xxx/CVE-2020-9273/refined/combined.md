When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

The SIMATIC CP 1543-1 and SIMATIC CP 1545-1 communication processor connects the S7-1500
controller to Ethernet networks. It provides integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption. The communication processor pro-
tects S7-1500 stations against unauthorized access, as well as integrity and conﬁdentiality of transmitted
data.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-9272

ProFTPD 1.3.7 has an out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability in mod_cap via the cap_text.c
cap_to_text function, that could lead to information disclosure.

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the1.3.9 release cycle, from the 1.3.9rc1 release to the 1.3.9 maintenancereleases. More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS andChangeLog files.
1.3.9rc3---------
 + When started with root privileges, ProFTPD now drops all supplemental group memberships, retaining only the UID/GID of the configured User/Group.
 + Properly use all configured ECDSA SSH hostkeys, not just the first configured ECSA SSH hostkey.
 + Fixed issue with RADIUS authentication when using mod\_radius and newer FreeRADIUS, due to BlastRadius mitigation.
 + New Directives
 SFTPAuthPublicKeys
 This directive can be used to enable support for only the specified list of public key algorithms, as for key-based user authentication. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPAuthPublicKeys for more.
 + Changed Directives
 SFTPExtensions +limits The mod\_sftp module now implements the "limits@openssh.com" custom SFTP extension, used by newer OpenSSH limitations for discovering server-side limits, such as larger SFTP READ/WRITE buffer lengths. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPExtensions.
1.3.9rc2---------
 + Implemented SSH mitigations for the "Terrapin" SSH attack (CVE-2023-48795).
 + Fixed compiling of 3rd party modules whose names match very specific regular expression patterns.
 + Changed Directives
 SFTPOptions NoStrictKex
 By default, mod\_sftp uses a "strict KEX" mode as a mitigation for the "Terrapin" SSH attack (CVE-2023-48795). Use of this strict mode may unexpectedly cause interoperability issues; this new SFTPOption can be used to disable this mode if necessary. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for more.
1.3.9rc1---------
 + Clients are disconnected if there is an error adding them to the ScoreboardFile. Previously, such errors were logged, but the session allowed to continue.
 + Implemented the "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" SSH cipher algorithm.
 + Implemented support for OpenSSH FIDO security keys in mod\_sftp.
 + The mod\_auth\_otp module now requires per-user entries in its tables by default. This is a change from previous versions, when such per-user entries were optional.
 + New Directives
 IfSessionOptions PerUnauthenticatedUser
 The mod\_ifsession module only applies its user/group-specific configurations after the client has authenticated itself. Some sites, however, may wish for user-specific configurations to be applied based on the unauthenticated username supplied by the client, such as in cases where the conditional configuration in question will affect the authentication process. The new PerUnauthenticatedUser IfSessionOption can be used to achieve this; see doc/contrib/mod\_ifsession.html#IfSessionOptions for more.
 ScoreboardOptions AllowMissingEntry
 Clients are now disconnected if they cannot be added to the ScoreboardFile. Some sites may require the previous behavior; use this new AllowMissingEntry ScoreboardOption to do so. See doc/modules/mod\_core.html#ScoreboardOptions for more information.
 + Changed Directives
 AuthOTPOptions OptionalTableEntry
 Now that the mod\_auth\_otp module requires an entry for each user, sites may need to re-enable the previous opt-in behavior. Use the OptionalTableEntry AuthOTPOption for this. Read doc/contrib/mod\_auth\_otp.html#AuthOTPOptions for details.
 DelayOnEvent Connect
 The DelayOnEvent directive can now be used to inject randomized delays, "jitter", at the start of a session. This can be used to spread out the processing of a large number of connections that occur at the same time, such as on a schedule/cron. See doc/modules/mod\_delay.html#DelayOnEvent for details.
 ExtendedLog SEC class
 SSH key exchange requests are now classified as "security" related messages, and thus are logged in ExtendedLog configurations that use the SEC logging class.
 LDAPDefaultGID, LDAPDefaultUID Auto
 Retrieving the UID, GID to use for users configured in ActiveDirectory domains, based on the default/expected attributes, is not always possible. In such cases, the new "Auto" value for the default UID, GID to use by mod\_ldap allows for retrieving the actual UID, GID by system user lookup, which is handled for AD domains by the special `sssd` program, for example.
 LogFormat %{transfer-speed}
 The LogFormat directive now supports a variable, %{transfer-speed}, for logging the average data transfer speed.
 SFTPCiphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
 The mod\_sftp module now implements OpenSSH's "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" algorithm.
 SFTPExtensions userGroupNames
 The mod\_sftp module supports the custom OpenSSH "users-groups-by-id@openssh.com" SFTP extension, used to retrieve the textual user/group names for given lists of UIDs, GIDs.
 SFTPOptions FIDOTouchRequired FIDOVerifyRequired
 OpenSSH FIDO security keys, such as Yubikeys, are now supported for SSH authentication by the mod\_sftp module. These keys allow for policies such as proof of user presence, and/or proof of user verification. These new SFTPOptions can be used to configure your site policies for such keys; see doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for more information.
 + Developer Notes
 Removed the unused `pr\_ctrls\_parse\_msg` Controls API function.

CVE ID         : CVE-2020-9273
Debian Bug     : 951800

Antonio Morales discovered an user-after-free flaw in the memory pool
allocator in ProFTPD, a powerful modular FTP/SFTP/FTPS server.
Interrupting current data transfers can corrupt the ProFTPD memory pool,
leading to denial of service, or potentially the execution of arbitrary
code.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3.5b-4+deb9u4.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6-4+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.

Subject: Possible memory leak on getspnam / getspnam_r

Hi,

The function getspnam() and it's reentrant sister getspnam_r() do not clean
the content of allocated memory before returning to the user, resulting in
the leak of /etc/shadow content. In some cases this might be an issue.

>From my tests, it doesn't matter whether the user calls getspnam_r (which
buffer is controlled by the user) rather than getspnam, both functions
malloc the buffer on itself (apparently the heap pointer is stored on
<respbuf> in libc by _nss_files_getspnam_r from libnss) and does not zero
it before returning.

I understand that this may be a desired behavior, caching, however there
might be some situations where that's not desired and the user has no
control over this buffer.

Let me put ProFTPd as an example: it's daemon starts as root, when it
receives a connection it forks, opens all the files that it'll need, then
it calls getspnam with the provided FTP user to validate the provided
password. Later on it setreuid(nobody) abandoning root privileges [1]. Here
it doesn't matter whether it calls getspnam or getspnam_r, the malloced
buffer will remain on heap memory (and it's pointer in libc <buffer> and
<respbuf>, I suppose). So now the child process is running on a low
privileged user and has a copy of /etc/shadow on it's heap memory.
The vulnerability CVE-2020-9273 [2] (an use-after-free on heap) allowed me
to get RCE on ProFTPd, in an exploit I created last year. Additionally,
thanks to getspnam caching it is possible to read the root cryptogram (and
other users).

I'm not suggesting that ProFTPd architecture is correct [3]. The problem is
that even if ProFTPd calls getspnam_r it has no mechanism to zero the cache
before forking, since internal pointers are not known to the user (read
developer).

Thus, although caching is mostly required for performance, maybe this
(caching) should happen only on getspnam function but not on getspnam_r.
That's because on getspnam_r the user wants to have control over this
buffering, then the user has a way to clean up it's memory when this
caching is not desired.

Thanks guys, and sorry if I slipped into any concept.
dukpt.

References:
[1] - ProFTPd opens root-writable-only files while running as root. I
understand that the permissions are validated during opening, so read /
write operations to duplicated file descriptors after fork are guaranteed
(thanks to Rick Altherr for pointing me out);
[2] - <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9273> ;
[3] - It is a good programming practice to exec right after fork.

N.B.: Perhaps another option could be creating a function similar to
endspent but that not only close() /etc/shadow but also bzero() internal
allocated memory. Since endspent does not wipe memory it's very likely that
[gs]etpent family also have the same behavior (I didn't test all functions
from the manual, so there might be others in similar situations). Also,
from the tests I did I think getspent and getspnam share the same buffer.

```

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-876b1f664e
2020-02-27 17:26:04.898880
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.3.6c
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update, to the current upstream stable release version, is a cumulative
bug-fix release including a security fix for a use-after-free vulnerability
(CVE-2020-9273): successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-76c707cff0
2020-02-27 16:43:31.470586
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.3.6c
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update, to the current upstream stable release version, is a cumulative
bug-fix release including a security fix for a use-after-free vulnerability
(CVE-2020-9273): successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Wed Feb 19 2020 Paul Howarth paul@city-fan.org - 1.3.6c-1
- Update to 1.3.6c

- Fix mod\_tls compilation with LibreSSL 2.9.x
(<https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/810>)
- MaxClientsPerUser was not enforced for SFTP logins when mod\_digest was
enabled (<https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/750>)
- mod\_sftp now handles an OpenSSH-specific private key format; it detects
such keys, and logs a hint about reformatting them to a supported format
(<https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/793>)
- Directory listing was slower compared to previous ProFTPD versions
(<https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/793>)

- ftpasswd failed to restore password file permissions in some cases
(<https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/898>)
- Out-of-bounds read in mod\_cap getstateflags() function; this has been
addressed by updating the bundled version of libcap
(<https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/902>)
Note that this build of ProFTPD uses the system version of libcap and not
the bundled version
\* Wed Jan 22 2020 Paul Howarth paul@city-fan.org - 1.3.6b-3
- Fix API tests compile failure with GCC 10
<https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/pull/886>

as used for (e.g.) PAM, make sure to properly handle DEBUG, IGNORE,
DISCONNECT, and UNIMPLEMENTED messages, per RFC 4253
(<http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4385>)
\* Fri Nov 29 2019 Paul Howarth paul@city-fan.org - 1.3.6b-2

There's no reliable way for a program to ensure nothing sensitive is
left in memory.  However, the library can make a better effort to make
it unlikely that password hashes would be left in memory.  Like you
suggested in another message (somehow detached from this thread),
endspent() could be a place to zeroize any knowingly cached sensitive
data, although it would only be usable that way by programs, not by
higher-level libraries where thread-safety matters.

An alternative programming practice is to fork() a child process for
authentication, then let that child process (with sensitive data in it)
terminate and have the service proceed to authenticated state (with
nothing from /etc/shadow having ever been loaded into its memory).  This
is what I implemented in popa3d from the start, see its auth_shadow.c
and DESIGN:

			 startup as root
				|
			-----------------
			|child          |parent
			v               v
	drop to user popa3d,            still as root,
	handle the AUTHORIZATION        wait for and
	state, write the results, - - > read the authentication
	and exit                        information
					|
			-----------------
			|child          |parent
			v               v
	getspnam(3), crypt(3),          wait for and
	check, write the result,  - - > read the authentication
	and exit (to clean up)          result
					|
					v
					drop to the authenticated user,
					handle the TRANSACTION state,
					possibly UPDATE the mailbox,
					and exit

This is also what we have in pam_tcb, enabled with the "fork" option:

       fork   Create child processes for accessing shadow files.   Using  this
              option  one can be sure that after a call to pam_end(3) there is
              no sensitive data left in the process' address space.   However,
              this  option  may  confuse some of the more complicated applica-
              tions and it has some performance overhead.

Maybe we should finally get pam_tcb into Linux-PAM, now that it no
longer depends on custom glibc patches since libxcrypt finally provides
our crypt_gensalt*() API.  Maybe we can have it fully replace pam_unix
in there, just like it had on Owl and ALT Linux 20 years ago.

Package        : proftpd-dfsg
Version        : 1.3.5e+r1.3.5-2+deb8u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-9273

It was discovered that there was a regression in a previous fix for a
use-after-free vulnerability in the proftpd-dfsg FTP server.

Exploitation of the original vulnerability within the memory pool handling
could have allowed a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the
affected system. However, the fix that was released in proftpd-dfsg
version 1.3.5e+r1.3.5-2+deb8u6 had a regression around the handling
of log formatting.

For more information, please see:

  <https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/903>

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in proftpd-dfsg version
1.3.5e+r1.3.5-2+deb8u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Description

![@antonio-morales](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55253029?u=10be3c0f3bb936095ecdbff24196161f122e4a94&v=4&size=48)[antonio-morales](https://github.com/antonio-morales)opened [on Feb 18, 2020](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/903#issue-567046320)

**This vulnerability was previously reported via email to security@proftpd.org and has been made public after the fix has been developed.**

### Credit

This issue was discovered and reported by GitHub Security Lab team member [@antonio-morales](https://github.com/antonio-morales) (Antonio Morales).

### Summary

A use-after-free vulnerability exists in ProFTPD. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

### Product

ProFTPD

### Tested Version

ProFTPD (development version)

### Details

#### Use-after-free vulnerability in memory pool allocator

It is possible to corrupt the ProFTPd memory pool by interrupting current data transfer (PoC Exploit Demo Video.webm).

In our PoC, the program crashes on "alloc\_pool" function (pool.c). This function executes the instruction first\_avail = blok->h.first\_avail.

As you can see, the right side operand of the assignment in pool.c:569 is p->last (Image1.png). However, the problem is that "p" is a corrupted pool (Image2.png).

The source of the problem comes from pcalloc call in netio.c:1066 (Image3.png). This function calls again to the "alloc\_pool" function which calls to "new\_block" to obtain a new freed memory block (Image4.png). But the memory block returned by "new\_block" is referenced by the "p" pool.

So, in short, "p" is a dangling pointer due to an use-after-free vulnerability.

It's important to note that our tests have shown that this vulnerability can also lead to other vulnerabilities (such as OOB write), so it increases the severity of the vulnerability.

### Impact

This issue may lead to Post-Auth RCE (maybe FTP anonymous users are also affected).

### Disclosure Policy

This report is subject to a 90 day coordinated disclosure policy.

The disclosure deadline for the findings outlined in this report is: 2020-04-21
