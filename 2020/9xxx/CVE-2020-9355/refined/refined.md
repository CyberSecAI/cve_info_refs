Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the mishandling of extra options passed to the `ssh` command by `NetworkManager-ssh`. Specifically, it appears that arbitrary options could be injected, allowing for privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** The application failed to sanitize or validate user-supplied options, allowing for the injection of malicious parameters into the ssh command.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting arbitrary options, a local user with the ability to modify a connection profile could execute commands with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system with root privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user could gain root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access to the system and the ability to modify network connection profiles managed by NetworkManager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A user must have the ability to modify NetworkManager connection profiles.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix involved removing the support for passing extra SSH options to the ssh invocation.
- The vulnerable versions were before 1.2.11. The fix was released in version 1.2.11 of NetworkManager-ssh.
- Debian issued DSA-4637-1 to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management).
- Red Hat Bugzilla Bug ID 1803499 is associated with this CVE.
