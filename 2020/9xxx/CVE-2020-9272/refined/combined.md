## Description

![@antonio-morales](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55253029?u=10be3c0f3bb936095ecdbff24196161f122e4a94&v=4&size=48)[antonio-morales](https://github.com/antonio-morales)opened [on Feb 18, 2020](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/902#issue-567039374)

**This vulnerability was previously reported via email to security@proftpd.org and has been made public after the fix has been developed.**

### Credit

This issue was discovered and reported by **GitHub Security Lab** team member [@antonio-morales](https://github.com/antonio-morales) (Antonio Morales).

### Summary:

An out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability has been detected in mod\_cap.

### Description:

The "cap\_to\_text()" function on "cap\_text.c" does a call to getstateflags(caps, n) [line 255].

When getstateflags(cap\_t caps, int capno) is called, "capno" is equal to 37 so "isset\_cap((\_\_cap\_s \*)(&caps->set.inheritable),capno)" will be expanded to "&((\_\_cap\_s \*)(&caps->set.inheritable))->\_blk[(37)>>5]", accesing caps->set.ineritable[1] that is outside of "caps" struct bounds (0x603000001ae4 to 0x603000001af7 in our example) [Image1.png]

As a result, OOB reads occurs resulting in accessing a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the caps struct variable.

This bug doesn't affect neither "set.effective" nor "set.permited". This is because in these cases "permited" and "inheritable" members are located just after them [Image2.png]

Please let me know when you have fixed the bugs so that I can coordinate my disclosure with yours. For reference, here is a link to GitHub's vulnerability disclosure policy: <https://securitylab.github.com/disclosures#policy>

Thank you,

recommendations from section

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable the embedded FTP server. The server is deactivated in the default conﬁguration

• Limit access to port 21/tcp to trusted IP addresses

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

The SIMATIC CP 1543-1 and SIMATIC CP 1545-1 communication processor connects the S7-1500
controller to Ethernet networks. It provides integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption. The communication processor pro-
tects S7-1500 stations against unauthorized access, as well as integrity and conﬁdentiality of transmitted
data.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-9272

ProFTPD 1.3.7 has an out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability in mod_cap via the cap_text.c
cap_to_text function, that could lead to information disclosure.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-9273

In ProFTPD 1.3.7, it is possible to corrupt the memory pool by interrupting the data transfer channel.
This triggers a use-after-free in alloc_pool in pool.c, and possible remote code execution.

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the1.3.9 release cycle, from the 1.3.9rc1 release to the 1.3.9 maintenancereleases. More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS andChangeLog files.
1.3.9rc3---------
 + When started with root privileges, ProFTPD now drops all supplemental group memberships, retaining only the UID/GID of the configured User/Group.
 + Properly use all configured ECDSA SSH hostkeys, not just the first configured ECSA SSH hostkey.
 + Fixed issue with RADIUS authentication when using mod\_radius and newer FreeRADIUS, due to BlastRadius mitigation.
 + New Directives
 SFTPAuthPublicKeys
 This directive can be used to enable support for only the specified list of public key algorithms, as for key-based user authentication. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPAuthPublicKeys for more.
 + Changed Directives
 SFTPExtensions +limits The mod\_sftp module now implements the "limits@openssh.com" custom SFTP extension, used by newer OpenSSH limitations for discovering server-side limits, such as larger SFTP READ/WRITE buffer lengths. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPExtensions.
1.3.9rc2---------
 + Implemented SSH mitigations for the "Terrapin" SSH attack (CVE-2023-48795).
 + Fixed compiling of 3rd party modules whose names match very specific regular expression patterns.
 + Changed Directives
 SFTPOptions NoStrictKex
 By default, mod\_sftp uses a "strict KEX" mode as a mitigation for the "Terrapin" SSH attack (CVE-2023-48795). Use of this strict mode may unexpectedly cause interoperability issues; this new SFTPOption can be used to disable this mode if necessary. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for more.
1.3.9rc1---------
 + Clients are disconnected if there is an error adding them to the ScoreboardFile. Previously, such errors were logged, but the session allowed to continue.
 + Implemented the "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" SSH cipher algorithm.
 + Implemented support for OpenSSH FIDO security keys in mod\_sftp.
 + The mod\_auth\_otp module now requires per-user entries in its tables by default. This is a change from previous versions, when such per-user entries were optional.
 + New Directives
 IfSessionOptions PerUnauthenticatedUser
 The mod\_ifsession module only applies its user/group-specific configurations after the client has authenticated itself. Some sites, however, may wish for user-specific configurations to be applied based on the unauthenticated username supplied by the client, such as in cases where the conditional configuration in question will affect the authentication process. The new PerUnauthenticatedUser IfSessionOption can be used to achieve this; see doc/contrib/mod\_ifsession.html#IfSessionOptions for more.
 ScoreboardOptions AllowMissingEntry
 Clients are now disconnected if they cannot be added to the ScoreboardFile. Some sites may require the previous behavior; use this new AllowMissingEntry ScoreboardOption to do so. See doc/modules/mod\_core.html#ScoreboardOptions for more information.
 + Changed Directives
 AuthOTPOptions OptionalTableEntry
 Now that the mod\_auth\_otp module requires an entry for each user, sites may need to re-enable the previous opt-in behavior. Use the OptionalTableEntry AuthOTPOption for this. Read doc/contrib/mod\_auth\_otp.html#AuthOTPOptions for details.
 DelayOnEvent Connect
 The DelayOnEvent directive can now be used to inject randomized delays, "jitter", at the start of a session. This can be used to spread out the processing of a large number of connections that occur at the same time, such as on a schedule/cron. See doc/modules/mod\_delay.html#DelayOnEvent for details.
 ExtendedLog SEC class
 SSH key exchange requests are now classified as "security" related messages, and thus are logged in ExtendedLog configurations that use the SEC logging class.
 LDAPDefaultGID, LDAPDefaultUID Auto
 Retrieving the UID, GID to use for users configured in ActiveDirectory domains, based on the default/expected attributes, is not always possible. In such cases, the new "Auto" value for the default UID, GID to use by mod\_ldap allows for retrieving the actual UID, GID by system user lookup, which is handled for AD domains by the special `sssd` program, for example.
 LogFormat %{transfer-speed}
 The LogFormat directive now supports a variable, %{transfer-speed}, for logging the average data transfer speed.
 SFTPCiphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
 The mod\_sftp module now implements OpenSSH's "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" algorithm.
 SFTPExtensions userGroupNames
 The mod\_sftp module supports the custom OpenSSH "users-groups-by-id@openssh.com" SFTP extension, used to retrieve the textual user/group names for given lists of UIDs, GIDs.
 SFTPOptions FIDOTouchRequired FIDOVerifyRequired
 OpenSSH FIDO security keys, such as Yubikeys, are now supported for SSH authentication by the mod\_sftp module. These keys allow for policies such as proof of user presence, and/or proof of user verification. These new SFTPOptions can be used to configure your site policies for such keys; see doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for more information.
 + Developer Notes
 Removed the unused `pr\_ctrls\_parse\_msg` Controls API function.
