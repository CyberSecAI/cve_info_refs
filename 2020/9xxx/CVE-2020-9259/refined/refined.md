- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system does not sufficiently validate certain parameters passed from the bottom level.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must trick the user into installing a malicious application and control the bottom level of the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the user install a malicious application and be able to control the bottom level of the system. This implies an attacker who has some level of control or access to the device's operating system or kernel, allowing them to manipulate or inject data into lower-level components.
