Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9309:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Silverstripe CMS relies on file extension whitelists for upload security instead of MIME type validation. This allows attackers to bypass security checks by crafting files with allowed extensions (e.g. ".txt") but with malicious content like HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **MIME Spoofing:** The core vulnerability is the system's failure to properly validate MIME types, relying on file extensions instead.
- **Script Execution:** When files with spoofed content (e.g., HTML within a .txt file) are served, the browser interprets them based on the detected MIME type and executes the malicious code.
- **Protected/Draft File Exposure:** Although these files are intended to be protected, the MIME spoofing flaw allows the malicious code to execute when accessed by authorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious scripts (e.g., Javascript) within the browser of users accessing protected or draft files.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful script execution could enable a range of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking, or other malicious activities targeting users of the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the CMS.
- **MIME Spoofing:** Attackers create files with allowed extensions but with content that can be interpreted as script (e.g. HTML, Javascript).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authorized CMS User:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user capable of uploading files. This can include users who are allowed to upload protected or draft files by default, as well as users of modules such as `silverstripe/userforms` which can enable file upload functionality.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by using the `silverstripe/mimevalidator` module, which validates file types based on MIME types instead of extensions.
- The vulnerability is automatically fixed by upgrading to `silverstripe/recipe-core` 4.6.0, which includes `silverstripe/mimevalidator` as a core dependency.
- For older versions, manual installation and configuration of `silverstripe/mimevalidator` is required.
- The `silverstripe/userforms` module was updated to include the `mimevalidator` module requirement, though initial updates of the module had errors and required subsequent releases to correct.
