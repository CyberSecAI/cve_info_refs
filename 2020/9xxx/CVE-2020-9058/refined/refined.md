Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of encryption and replay protection in Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 500 series chipsets when using CRC-16 encapsulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Encryption:** The Z-Wave communication using CRC-16 encapsulation is not encrypted.
*   **Lack of Replay Protection:**  There is no mechanism to prevent replay attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker within Z-Wave radio range can intercept, observe, and replay traffic.
*   Potentially, the attacker can control vulnerable devices.
*   Could result in unauthorized access and control over the Z-Wave devices

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is within the Z-Wave radio range.
*   An attacker could send malicious Z-Wave packets

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be within the radio range of the Z-Wave network.
*   The attacker needs the ability to intercept and replay Z-Wave packets.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is present in Silicon Labs 500 series chipsets using CRC-16 encapsulation.
*   The vendor, Silicon Labs, acknowledges this as a known weakness with unencrypted traffic, and suggests using S0 or S2 security for encryption.
*   Other vendors that use these chipsets such as Aeotec, Dome Home Automation, Fibaro, Jasco, Linear, Samsung, Schlage and Zooz are listed as affected. However, there's no specific vendor statements from these vendors besides Silicon Labs.
