- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Resource management errors within a Huawei smartphone application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper resource management leading to application instability. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when a local attacker constructs a malicious broadcast message for an application. The affected application then processes the crafted message, causing issues with resource management.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can impact the customer's user experience, leading to issues with the application's stability and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious broadcast messages for specific applications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the smartphone in order to construct and send the malicious broadcast message.
