- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in Bluetooth state management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper state management in Bluetooth leading to potential interception.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to intercept Bluetooth traffic.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be in a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a privileged network position to intercept Bluetooth traffic.
