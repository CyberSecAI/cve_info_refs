Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks in the Community plugin for Piwigo. Specifically, the plugin allows users to modify image information by manipulating the `image_id` parameter, without verifying if the user has the necessary permissions to access the image's album.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of checks to ensure that a user has permission to modify image data. The plugin does not validate if the user has access to the album containing the image identified by the manipulated `image_id` parameter.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be triggered by tampering with the `image_id` parameter, allowing a malicious user to target any existing image within the Piwigo instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker could modify image information (metadata) of images that they should not have access to. This could include changing titles, descriptions, or other associated data.
- **Potential for Data Corruption or Misinformation:** Manipulation of metadata could potentially lead to data corruption or the spread of misinformation.
- **Circumventing intended access restrictions:** Users can effectively bypass the access control intended by the gallery.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `image_id` parameter within the request. This is likely done through a web request that sends the modified `image_id` to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the Piwigo instance using the vulnerable plugin.
- **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be capable of manipulating parameters within web requests, which is a common skill for those with basic web application knowledge.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information suggests that the vulnerability is present in the "Community plugin 2.9.e-beta for Piwigo" and that later versions addressed the issue.
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2020-9468 and GHSA-m8qh-vrwv-jwqr
- The severity is rated as "Moderate".
