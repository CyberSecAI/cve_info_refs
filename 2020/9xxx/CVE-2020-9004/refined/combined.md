# CVE-2020-9004-Authenticated Remote Authorization Bypass Leading to RCE

A remote authenticated authorization bypass vulnerability in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.8 (build 20191105123929), allows any read-only user to issue requests to the administration panel in order to change functionality of the application. For example a read only user may activate the java JMX port in unauthenticated mode and execute OS system commands under root privileges.

### Evidence

## New features and functionality in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

Wowza Streaming Engine is a robust, customizable, and scalable media server software that powers reliable streaming of high-quality video and audio to any device, anywhere. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 contains several enhancements and fixes that help to improve the functionality of the media server software.

#### WebRTC updates

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 includes significant upgrades and fixes for WebRTC functionality. We added support for configuring WebRTC streaming in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager and made WebRTC hosted test pages available for faster learning and testing. Additionally, we improved the accuracy of RTCP feedback messages for adaptive encoding when publishing WebRTC to Wowza Streaming Engine, and we improved the stability of WebRTC session timeouts. We also updated FIR messages to default to a more reliable time-based scheme, which enables a more regular interval for accessing WebRTC streams via a keyframe. For more information about WebRTC and Wowza Streaming Engine, see the following the articles:

* [Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine Manager](/docs/set-up-webrtc-streaming-with-wowza-streaming-engine-manager "Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine Manager")
* [Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-webrtc-with-wowza-streaming-engine "Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine")
* [WebRTC workflows in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/webrtc-workflows-in-wowza-streaming-engine "WebRTC workflows in Wowza Streaming Engine")
* [Ingest RTSP, SRT, or RTMP streams into Wowza Streaming Engine for playback with WebRTC](/docs/ingest-rtsp-srt-or-rtmp-streams-into-wowza-streaming-engine-for-playback-with-webrtc "Ingest RTSP, SRT, or RTMP streams into Wowza Streaming Engine for playback with WebRTC")

#### SRT improvements

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 offers enhanced support for Secure Reliable Transport (SRT). We now support SRT version 1.4, which provides increased reliability. Other improvements include a number of new and renamed properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest and SRT stream targets and fixes for outstanding issues. For more information on newly available SRT properties, see the following articles:

* [Specify per-stream settings in Wowza Streaming Engine .stream files](/docs/how-to-specify-per-stream-settings-in-stream-files "Specify per-stream settings in Wowza Streaming Engine .stream files")
* [Use SRT to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-srt-to-distribute-live-streams "Use SRT to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine")

#### Low Latency HLS enhancements

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 includes adjustments to the Low Latency HLS implementation to keep up-to-date with modifications to Apple’s preliminary protocol extension to the HLS spec. We've added support for the EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT media playlist tag, removed the HTTP/2 push delivery mechanism, and made other minor changes.

#### Performance upgrades

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5, we've increased playback performance for connections over SSL/TLS, updated the default server performance tuning, made general WebRTC performance upgrades, and updated MediaCaster ingest performance.

#### Security improvements

In Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5, we've fixed Wowza Streaming Engine Manager security concerns related to CSRF, authenticated XSS, and remote authenticated authorization. We've also added support for additional security-related HTTP headers in request responses, and we've enabled stricter Wowza Streaming Engine file access permissions on Linux and macOS.

## Installation and upgrade considerations for Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

We've repackaged the version of OpenJDK Java SE JRE 9.0.4 available with the release of Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 to address an issue that caused a memory leak in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager. To take advantage of this fix, use the custom packaged version of OpenJDK when upgrading to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 or later.

When using the Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 installer to install a new instance of Wowza Streaming Engine on Windows, you may need to install additional dependencies in order to ingest SRT MediaCaster streams or use the generic SRT stream targets destination to publish an SRT stream. To address this, install the latest version of the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) appropriate to your operating system. This is not an issue for pre-existing installations of Wowza Streaming Engine that are updated to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5.

## Breaking changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

If you're updating from a version of Wowza Streaming Engine earlier than 4.8.5, the following file and library changes break functionality if you don't take steps to address them.

### Wowza Streaming Engine REST API breaking changes

The Wowza Streaming Engine REST API authentication method values 'none' and 'basic' are no longer compatible with using Wowza Streaming Engine Manager to control and manage the media server software. If you plan to use Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, use 'digest', 'digestfile', or 'remotehttp' authentication methods instead (location: [install-dir]/conf/Server.xml, <RestInterface>/<AuthenticationMethod>).

### Wowza Streaming Engine built-in HTTP provider breaking changes

To enable security updates for Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, we removed two built-in HTTP providers: HTTPLiveStreamRecord and HTTPStreamManager. The Live Stream Record webpage (http://[wowza-ip-address]:8086/livestreamrecord) and the Stream Manager webpage (http://[wowza-ip-address]:8086/streammanager) are no longer available.

As a replacement for the Stream Manager HTTP provider and webpage, see [Create and use .stream files in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-create-and-use-stream-files-in-wowza-streaming-engine-manager "Create and use .stream files in Wowza Streaming Engine"). Alternatively, see [Create and manage stream files by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API](/docs/stream-management-query-examples "Create and manage stream files by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API") or [Control Stream class streams dynamically with a Wowza Streaming Engine Java module](/docs/how-to-control-stream-class-streams-dynamically-httpstreamcontrol "Control Stream class streams dynamically with a Wowza Streaming Engine Java module"). A compiled jar file with a customized version of the removed Stream Manager HTTP provider is available with instructions from Wowza support.

As a replacement for the Live Stream Record HTTP provider and webpage, see [Create and manage stream recorders by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API](/docs/stream-recording-query-examples "Create and manage stream recorders by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API") or [Record live streams in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-record-live-streams-wowza-streaming-engine "Record live streams in Wowza Streaming Engine"). A compiled jar file with a customized version of the removed Live Stream Record HTTP provider is available with instructions from Wowza support.

## Detailed list of changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

#### Changes since 4.8.0 release

* Improved the Wowza Streaming Engine updater script to implement stricter file access permissions on Linux and macOS.
* Fixed an issue with the RTPDePacketizerWrapperReChunkMPEGTS property that allowed non-MPEG-TS data to be manipulated.
* Updated the Restlet framework library to version 2.3.12.
* Fixed issue where "@" characters were incorrectly filtered from data saved to XML files using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
* Fixed an issue where HTTP requests routed to HTTP Providers on HostPorts defined in VHost.xml would throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
* Fixed an issue with search functionality in Wowza Streaming Engine Java API reference documentation.
* Added support for the Connection HTTP header in HTTP providers.
* Added a new property (name: cupertinoCacheableSegments, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<HTTPStreamer>/<Properties>, type: Boolean, default: false) to enable identical segment URLs inside each session media playlist to support caching of segments for live or live edge applications.
* Fixed an issue with returning incorrect H.265 video codec information with calls to get incoming streams using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API (version 3).
* Fixed an issue that caused a null pointer exception when using the live-record StreamType and specifying a recording file format that is not supported, such as MP3.
* Removed the Wowza Player page from Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Changed the loadBalanceHTTPOutputClasses property name to loadbalanceHTTPOutputClasses in the Dynamic Load Balancing AddOn 4.5 to fix an issue with output classes not loading.

#### WebRTC

* Fixed issue that caused WebRTC playback connections to ignore the maximumPlaybackConnections property for ModuleCoreSecurity.
* Improved the calculation for the jitter value sent in a receiver report for WebRTC MediaCaster ingest. The jitter value is now calculated according to IETF RFC 3550.
* Improved WebRTC publisher and player timeouts as well as resource deallocation.
* Added the ability to block publishing and playing of WebRTC streams when using the IMediaStreamNameAliasProvider3 Java API interface.
* Fixed issues with WebRTC session initiation for streams that used query parameters in their stream names.
* Added support for configuring WebRTC streaming for live applications in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Added support for enabling WebRTC for Virtual Host host ports in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Added support for negative acknowledgements (NACK) to make RTCP feedback messages more accurate, which aids in adaptive encoding and reduces packet loss when publishing WebRTC streams to Wowza Streaming Engine.
  + Added support for a jitter buffer for WebRTC streaming that is capable of handling out of order and retransmitted packets. The jitter buffer can be enabled with the rtpDePacketizerWrapper property (location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; value: com.wowza.wms.rtp.depacketizer.JitterBuffer).
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: useNack; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to enable sending of NACK messages to publishing clients to allow for retransmission of lost packets. The jitter buffer must also be enabled for this property to work.
    - Added a new property (name: jitterBufferDelay; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 500) to configure the delay added by the jitter buffer. The time, in milliseconds, allows for out-of-order and retransmitted packets to be played in order, provided they are received in time.
    - Added a new property (name: jitterBufferDebug; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to debug information about retransmitted packets and whether they were retrieved in time.
    - Added a new property (name: logPacketLoss; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to enable logging when packets are lost.
* Changed the default Full Intra Request (FIR) message scheme to be time based instead of frame based to enable a more regular interval for accessing WebRTC streams via a keyframe.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: webrtcFIRMessageScheme, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<WebRTC>/<Properties>, type: string, default: time) that specifies the scheme for the FIR message interval.
    - Added a new property (name: webrtcFIRMessageInterval, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<WebRTC>/<Properties>, type: integer, default: 1000) that specifies the interval between FIR messages.
  + Deprecated the following properties:
    - webrtcKeyFrameType. Use the webrtcFIRMessageScheme property instead.
    - webrtcKeyFrameTimeInterval. Use the webrtcFIRMessageInterval property instead.
    - webrtcKeyFrameTimeIntervalThreshold. No replacement is needed.
* Fixed an issue with WebRTC streams sent over TCP not maintaining a high bitrate.
* Fixed an issue with the format of RTCP receiver reports by including an SDES packet containing a CNAME for WebRTC MediaCaster ingest.
* Removed Vorbis from the list of preferred audio codecs for WebRTC in Application.xml.
* Fixed an issue with the server failing to start up properly when a virtual host was configured to listen for WebRTC WebSocket connections on a HostPort that did not have SSL/TLS enabled.
* Fixed an issue with UDP sessions sometimes failing to close for WebRTC sessions due to a race condition.

#### RTP/RTSP

* Fixed an issue with RTSP streaming that caused a null pointer exception to occur when using a jitter buffer.
* Added support for IP address message filtering for UDP messages received within an RTSP or RTP/RTCP session. This filtering can eliminate stream cross-talk when a disconnected RTSP source continues to send UDP messages to the same ports after the ports have been reallocated to a new RTSP connection.
  + Added a new property to enable IP address message filtering on RTSP streams (name: rtspCheckIpAddresses, type: Boolean, path: Root/Application/RTP, default: false).
  + For applications that support RTSP sources that use different IP addresses for their RTSP and RTP/RTCP communications, IP address filtering for RTSP streams shouldn't be enabled. If it is enabled, all packets will be dropped.
* Updated the name of the property used to enable debug logging for RTSP streams (name: rtspDebugSession, path: Root/Application/RTP, type: Boolean,  default: false). The property can also be used in a .stream file to affect only the steam associated with the file. This property replaces rtpDebugSession.

#### SRT

* Updated the SRT implementation to version 1.4 for increased reliability.
* Fixed an issue where the onStreamStop() callback for SRT sometimes had a null stream. There is always a stream object available when calling mediacaster.getStream().
* Fixed a memory leak that could be caused by disconnecting and reconnecting SRT MediaCaster streams.
* Made the following updates to .stream file properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest:
  + Deprecated the following properties:
    - srtDataTimeout. Use the streamTimeout parameter instead (name: streamTimeout; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Integer). This prompts Wowza Streaming Engine to monitor the stream. If a break occurs in the stream that's longer than the streamTimeout value, in milliseconds, it resets the connection to the camera.
    - srtTrafficType. There is no replacement needed.
    - SendBufferSize. There is no replacement needed.
    - SendBufferSizeUDP. There is no replacement needed.
  + Renamed the following properties:
    - The srtLatency property (name: srtLatency; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 400) replaces srtRecoveryBuffer and specifies the latency, in milliseconds. This is the time it takes for a UDP packet to be sent and delivered, including the time required to account for sending and retransmitting lost packets. The srtLatency value should be 2.5 times the round trip time (RTT). When peers set different latency values, the maximum of the two values applies to both peers.
    - The srtReceiveBufferSize property (name: srtReceiveBufferSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 12058624) replaces receiveBufferSize and specifies the receive buffer size, in bytes.
    - The srtReceiveBufferSizeUDP property (name: srtReceiveBufferSizeUDP; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 12288000) replaces receiveBufferSizeUDP and specifies the receive buffer size for UDP connections, in bytes.
    - The srtTimestampBasedDeliveryMode property (name: srtTimestampBasedDeliveryMode; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) replaces srtTimeMode and specifies whether the SRT time-stamp based packet delivery mode is enabled.
    - The srtTooLatePacketDrop property (name: srtTooLatePacketDrop; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) replaces srtLatePacketDrop and specifies whether all packets that are received late are dropped.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: srtDebug; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) that specifies whether to write additional details to log files for SRT workflow debugging.
    - Added a new property (name: srtFlightFlagSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 25600) that specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be sent without being acknowledged.
    - Added a new property (name: srtInputBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that works with srtOverheadBandwidth to specificy the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100. If srtInputBandwidth is set to 0, then input bandwidth is estimated from the rate of input during transmission.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyAnnounce; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0x1000) that specifies the interval between when a new encryption key is sent and when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and when the old encryption key is decommissioned.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyRefreshRate; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0x1000000) that specifies the number of packets to be transmitted with an encryption key before switching to a new key.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: -1) that specifies the maximum bandwidth, in bytes per second, that the connection can use. Valid values are -1 (infinite), 0 (calculated from srtInputBandwidth and srtOverheadBandwidth), and integers greater than 0 for an absolute limit in bytes per second.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumSegmentSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 1500) that specifies the maximum size for a unit of transfer data (MTU), in bytes. For MPEG-TS streams, use the default.
    - Added a new property (name: srtOverheadBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 25) that works with srtInputBandwidth to specificy the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100.
    - Added a new property (name: srtPacketLossTolerance; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that specifies the maximum packet reorder tolerance, which is the number of packets to receive after loss before sending a loss report. When set to 0, the loss report is sent immediately when there is a gap in a sequence.
    - Added a new property (name: srtReconnectWaitTime; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 3000) that specifies, in milliseconds, how often the listener looks for an incoming stream. If a source drops, and the immediate reconnection attempt fails, the system waits this amount of time before looking for an incoming stream again.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendNakReports; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) that enables the receiver to send periodic NAK (Negative Acknowledgment) packet reports.
    - Added a new property (name: srtTimesToPrintStats; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that specifies how many times stream statistics are written into the log after the stream starts. Statistics are logged each second. Set to -1 to log statistics indefinitely.
* Previously added SRT properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest can now be configured in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Made the following updates to SRT Stream Target properties, which can be configured in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager or the PushPublishMap.txt file:
  + Renamed the following property:
    - The srtLatency property (name: srtLatency, type: Integer, default: 400) replaces Recovery Buffer and specifies the latency, in milliseconds. This is the time it takes for a UDP packet to be sent and delivered, including the time required to account for sending and retransmitting lost packets. The srtLatency value should be 2.5 times the round trip time (RTT). When peers set different latency values, the maximum of the two values applies to both peers.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: srtConnectTimeout, type: integer, default: 3000) that specifies how long Wowza Streaming Engine waits for a target to respond to a connection request.
    - Added a new property (name: srtFlightFlagSize, type: integer, default: 25600) that specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be sent without being acknowledged.
    - Added a new property (name: srtInputBandwidth, type: integer, default: 0) that works with srtOverheadBandwidth to specify the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100. If srtInputBandwidth is set to 0, then input bandwidth is estimated from the rate of input during transmission.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyAnnounce, type: integer, default: 0x1000) that specifies the interval between when a new encryption key is sent and when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and when the old encryption key is decommissioned.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyRefreshRate, type: integer, default: 0x1000000) that specifies the number of packets to be transmitted with an encryption key before switching to a new key.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumBandwidth, type: integer, default: -1) that specifies the maximum bandwidth, in bytes per second, that the connection can use. Valid values are -1 (infinite), 0 (calculated from srtInputBandwidth and srtOverheadBandwidth), and integers greater than 0 for an absolute limit in bytes per second.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumSegmentSize, type: integer, default: 1500) that specifies the maximum size for a unit of transfer data (MTU), in bytes. For MPEG-TS streams, use the default.
    - Added a new property (name: srtOverheadBandwidth, type: integer, default: 25) that works with srtInputBandwidth to specify the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100.
    - Added a new property (name: srtPeerIdleTimeout, type: integer, default: 5000) that specifies, in milliseconds, the peer idle timeout, or the maximum time of silence heard from a peer.
    - Added a new property (name: srtStreamId, type: string, default: none) that populates a string sent on the socket prior to connecting. Length is a maximum of 512 characters. If using a stream ID, a peer connection must have a minimum SRT version of 1.3.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendBufferSize, type: integer, default: 12058624) that specifies the send buffer size, in bytes.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendBufferSizeUDP, type: integer, default: 65536) that specifies the send buffer size for UDP connections, in bytes.
    - Added a new property (name: srtTimesToPrintStats, type: integer, default: 0) that specifies how many times stream statistics are written into the log after the stream starts. Statistics are logged each second. Set to -1 to log statistics indefinitely.

#### HLS, Low-Latency HLS, and CMAF

* Fixed an issue with Low Latency HLS that caused player requests for partial segments associated with completed media segments to fail with 404 resource not found errors.
* Removed support for the HTTP/2 push delivery mechanism.
* Added support for the EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT media playlist tag.
* Added support for blocking partial segment requests based on EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT tags.
* Added support for setting PART-HOLD-BACK in all media playlists in a multi-rendition, adaptive-bitrate playback session to at least three times the maximum PART-TARGET value across the renditions.

#### MPEG-DASH

* Fixed an issue with the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API that caused the LiveStreamPacketizer to fail to set a value for the mpegdashSegmentDurationTarget property.
* Fixed an issue with CMAF-packetized MPEG-DASH live stream encryption using key files. Previously, including both mpegdashstreaming-cenc and cmafstreaming-cenc entries in a key file could result in the generation of an invalid MPD file.
* Added millisecond precision to dates for the availibilityStartTime and publishTime properties in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files for live applications.
* Fixed an issue with the sample duration value under MP4 track headers that was causing playback issues for MPEG-DASH VOD streams on ExoPlayer players in Android apps.
* Fixed an issue with increasing heap memory with MPEG-DASH stream targets when Playlist Count (http.playlistCount) was set to a high value.
* Fixed an issue with the mpegdashSegmentDurationTarget property not being read correctly for MPEG-DASH VOD streams.
* Fixed an issue with setting the Akamai Event Name and Adaptive Group properties and enabling relative playlists (http.relativePlaylists) for MPEG-DASH Akamai stream targets that resulted in an incorrect BaseURL value in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files.
* Fixed an issue with setting the Akamai Event Name property, setting the Destination Server property to redundant, and enabling relative playlists (http.relativePlaylists) for MPEG-DASH Akamai stream targets that resulted in an incorrect primary BaseURL value in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files.

#### Live Stream Encoding, Decoding, Transcoding, and Transrating

* Fixed a performance regression when using NVIDIA hardware accelerated decoding on multiple graphics cards that lead to dropped frames before hardware limits were reached.
* Fixed an issue that created extra transcoding sessions and didn't clean them up properly.
* Fixed an issue with RTMP streams that use H.264 Annex B start codes not processing.
* Fixed an issue with decoded frame sizes not updating correctly when accessed through the video decoder API in the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API.
* Fixed an issue that caused transcoder sessions to not close down properly when quickly republishing a stream.

#### Stream Targets (Push Publishing)

* Fixed an issue that caused the creation of duplicate Group Manager, Wowza Streaming Cloud, and Wowza CDN stream target sessions when a new target was added, an existing target was modified or restarted, or targets were enabled.
* Fixed an issue with HLS-based stream targets where a restart of a stream's Cupertino packetizer due to source stream issues resulted in associated stream targets failing to push the stream.

#### Live Stream DVR Playback (Wowza nDVR)

* Added a new interface, IDvrConverterActionNotify, for the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API. This interface invokes onConversionComplete after DVR conversion finishes, sending a notification to registered onConversionComplete listeners with the DVR store handle and the converted file’s name.
* Fixed an issue with MPEG-DASH nDVR functionality that caused video duration to decrease during playback.
* Fixed an issue with the dvrPacketSortTime property. When dvrPacketSortTime was set to add latency to DVR playback, additional unnecessary log messages appeared in the log file. With updated behavior, logs show a single entry when a problem arises in the DVR stream.

#### Performance improvements

* Improved performance of players connecting over SSL/TLS for TCP streaming.
* Updated the MediaCaster transport handler to use the VHost transport thread pool to increase throughput when many MediaCaster streams are used.
* Increased the defaults for Java heap size and several thread counts when using auto-tuning to better match modern hardware capabilities and increase server throughput.
* Updated the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager limits for Java heap size and thread counts to better match modern hardware capabilities.

#### Security improvements

* Added support for the following security-related HTTP headers in request responses with Content-Type: text/html:
  + Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
  + X-Frame-Options: deny
  + X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  + X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  + Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
* Upgraded the jQuery library to version 3.5.1.
* Fixed several issues with authenticated XSS security vulnerabilities in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Fixed several issues with CSRF security vulnerabilities in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Fixed an issue with a remote authenticated authorization bypass security vulnerability that could allow an unauthorized user to make changes in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.
