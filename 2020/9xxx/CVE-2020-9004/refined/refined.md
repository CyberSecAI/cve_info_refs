Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9004:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-9004. It describes a vulnerability in Wowza Streaming Engine that allows a read-only user to bypass authorization and execute administrative actions, as indicated by the title and content of the provided files. The description of the vulnerability is consistent with a remote, authenticated authorization bypass issue.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the Wowza Streaming Engine's access control mechanism within the administrative panel. The vulnerability allows any authenticated user, even those with read-only permissions, to send POST requests to modify the server's configuration, thereby bypassing intended authorization restrictions.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly enforce authorization checks, allowing read-only users to perform actions that should be restricted to administrators.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** The system lacks adequate controls to differentiate between read-only and administrative users when processing POST requests to modify the application's settings.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the authorization bypass, an attacker can enable the Java JMX port in unauthenticated mode. This allows the attacker to execute OS commands with root privileges using tools like Metasploit's `java_jmx_server` module.
*   **System Compromise:** The ability to execute OS commands as root leads to full system compromise. Attackers can install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Read-only users gain administrative privileges, escalating their access and enabling them to fully control the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers can change critical settings, leading to disruption of service and potential data loss or corruption.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack vector involves sending malicious HTTP POST requests to the Wowza Streaming Engine's administration panel.
*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs valid credentials to a read-only user account to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **JMX port activation:** By exploiting the authorization bypass, the JMX port can be enabled with no authentication.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Wowza Streaming Engine's server.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate using a valid read-only user account.
*  **Metasploit (or similar tools):** To achieve RCE, knowledge and tools that can utilize the JMX service, such as metasploit modules, are necessary.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub content includes a proof-of-concept demonstrating how an attacker can enable the JMX port and achieve RCE.
*   The vulnerability was present in Wowza Streaming Engine versions 4.8.0 and earlier and was fixed in version 4.8.5.
*  The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability and released a patch.

In summary, CVE-2020-9004 is a critical vulnerability that allows an authenticated user with read-only privileges to bypass authorization, enabling remote code execution and full system compromise by activating the JMX port and utilizing a specific metasploit module.
