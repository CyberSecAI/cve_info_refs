  "CVE-2020-9548": {
    "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.4, 2.8.11.6, and 2.7.9.7 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to br.com.anteros.dbcp.AnterosDBCPConfig (aka anteros-core).",
    "affected_products": [
      "FasterXML jackson-databind versions 2.x prior to 2.9.10.4",
      "FasterXML jackson-databind versions 2.x prior to 2.8.11.6",
      "FasterXML jackson-databind versions 2.x prior to 2.7.9.7",
          "Oracle products using jackson-databind"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from mishandling of serialization gadgets and typing, specifically in relation to the br.com.anteros.dbcp.AnterosDBCPConfig class.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks exploiting deserialization via untrusted JSON content."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send malicious JSON data to a system using Jackson for deserialization. The targeted system must enable polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type of java.lang.Object or other permissive interfaces like java.util.Serializable, java.util.Comparable, and java.lang.Cloneable.",
          "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is specific to the use of class name as the type id, which allows the attacker to specify arbitrary class names during deserialization, and enabling default typing can also lead to the exposure. The exploit is also dependent on specific gadget classes existing in the classpath. Patches are required in Jackson to block these gadget types."
