The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Dolibarr 11, focusing on XSS and arbitrary file upload leading to remote code execution.

**1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization in the user profile customization feature.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application allows a user to inject arbitrary HTML code into their profile, which is then rendered when other users (including admins) view that profile.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browser of any user that views the compromised profile. This can potentially lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user with the ability to modify their profile injects malicious code into profile fields.
*   **Required Capabilities:** A user account with access to the profile customization feature.

**2. File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution:**

*   **Root Cause:** The admin module upload feature allows arbitrary file uploads without sufficient checks, specifically by uploading a module containing a PHP webshell.
*   **Vulnerability:** An administrator can upload a specially crafted module (zip archive) containing a PHP webshell. This allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain complete control over the server by executing arbitrary code through the uploaded webshell.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with admin access uploads a malicious module.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Administrative access to the Dolibarr instance and write permissions to the modules directory.

**3. Reflected XSS via URL Parameters:**

*   **Root Cause:** Certain URL parameters, specifically `joinfiles`, `topic`, and `code`, are vulnerable to reflected XSS.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode data provided via the URL parameters, allowing for arbitrary HTML/JavaScript injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when clicked by a user, will execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a malicious URL containing XSS payload and lures users to click on it.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to get a user to click the crafted URL.
