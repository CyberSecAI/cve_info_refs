Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of ownership checks within the Manila share network database API. Specifically, the API did not verify if a user was authorized to perform actions on a share network, based on the project (tenant) to which the share network belonged. This allowed users to potentially interact with share networks not owned by them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authorization checks based on project IDs when accessing share network resources.
- **Context-Free UUID Lookup:**  The API used a context-free UUID lookup, meaning it didn't verify if the user had permission to operate on the share network identified by the UUID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker who knows the ID of a share network belonging to another tenant could:
  - **View:** Retrieve details of the share network.
  - **Create:** Create shares and share groups on the target share network. This could lead to a denial of service by "clobbering" the namespace of another tenant.
  - **Manipulate:** Create/delete share network subnets, update share network metadata.
  - **Delete:** Delete the share network.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Knowledge of Share Network ID:** The primary attack vector is having knowledge of the UUID of a share network that belongs to a different tenant.
- **UUID Exposure:** Although UUIDs are generally considered difficult to guess, they might be exposed through other means, such as:
    - **Sniffing Network Packets:** Intercepting network traffic containing the share network UUID.
    - **Insecure Clients:** Capturing data from insecure clients where the UUIDs might be exposed.
    - **Social Engineering:** Obtaining UUIDs through social engineering.
    - **Publicly Shared UUIDs:** Users might unintentionally share UUIDs in public places like git repositories, not realizing their security implications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Any User with OpenStack Account:** Any authenticated user of the OpenStack Manila service, even with limited privileges, can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of a Share Network UUID:** The user needs to have the UUID of a share network belonging to another tenant.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Severity:** The Manila team initially considered this a low risk (due to the unlikelihood of UUID guessing), but later recognized the severity after considering various attack vectors for obtaining the UUID.
- **Fix:** The fix involves implementing `project_only` checks in the database queries to ensure that users can only access share networks within their project context.
- **Affected Versions:** OpenStack Manila versions <7.4.1, >=8.0.0 <8.1.1, and >=9.0.0 <9.1.1 are affected. Patches were also provided for older releases that are under extended maintenance (Queens and Pike), but no new releases will be made for those versions.
