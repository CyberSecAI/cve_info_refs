Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-9457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control and nonce checks in multiple AJAX actions within the RegistrationMagic plugin. This allows a user with low privileges (subscriber) to import a specially crafted form and then configure it as the default form. Subsequently, this malicious form is used to register a new administrative user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unprotected AJAX actions:** Several AJAX actions related to form import, form configuration and setting default forms lack necessary security checks (nonce and capability checks).
2.  **Form Import Functionality**: The plugin allows users to upload forms through an AJAX action without proper validation.
3.  **Form Configuration Modification:** Unprotected AJAX actions allow any user to modify the settings of an existing form, including setting expiration and redirection options
4.  **Default Form Manipulation**: An unprotected AJAX action allows a user to set any form as the default form, even if it is malicious.
5.  **Abuse of usermeta table**: The plugin's feature to save user-submitted content directly to the usermeta table is abused to modify a user's permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By importing a malicious form, an attacker can register a new administrative user, gaining full control of the WordPress site.
*   **Complete Site Takeover:** With the ability to create an admin user, the attacker has the potential to perform any actions on the site including modifying files, deleting content, and installing malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker uses HTTP requests to interact with the WordPress site and trigger AJAX calls.
*   **Exploiting plugin functionalities**: Attack vector involves exploiting a chain of plugin's functionalities: uploading a form, setting form expiration, substituting with malicious form and configuring it as default form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Subscriber Account:** The attacker needs an account with subscriber-level permissions on the target WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin's Vulnerable Functionalities**: The attacker needs to be aware of the insecure AJAX actions for form import, configuration, and default form settings to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Details**

* The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a crafted form with specific settings that modify the `wp_user_level` and `wp_capabilities` user meta keys.
* The vulnerability is made worse by the lack of nonce checks and capability checks on plugin actions.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.6.0.4 of the RegistrationMagic plugin.
