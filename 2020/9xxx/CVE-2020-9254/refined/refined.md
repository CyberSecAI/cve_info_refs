- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error occurs when the software is checking the size of a certain parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper size check, leading to a logic error.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious application and convince a user to install it on a vulnerable device. They need to bypass any security checks when installing the application.
