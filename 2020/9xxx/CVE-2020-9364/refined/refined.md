Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue within the mailer component of the "Creative Contact Form" Joomla extension. The `mailer.php` file, specifically at line 290, constructs a file path based on user-supplied input from the `$_POST['creativecontactform_upload']` array without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The application directly uses user-supplied file names to construct file paths for attachment without any validation, allowing an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended path and access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The code fails to sanitize or validate the file names provided in the `$_POST['creativecontactform_upload']` array, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server, including sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.
- **Information Leakage:** Successful exploitation can lead to information leakage, which can be used for further attacks or malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed via an HTTP POST request to the contact form.
- **Manipulated `creativecontactform_upload` Parameter:** The attacker needs to manipulate the `$_POST['creativecontactform_upload']` parameter to include directory traversal sequences like `../`.
- **"Send me a copy" Feature:** The "Send me a copy" option, if enabled, triggers the email functionality that attaches the file specified by the malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable parameter: `creativecontactform_upload` .

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in Creative Contact Form versions before December 3, 2019 (specifically version 4.6.2 and prior).
- The vulnerability is considered critical because it allows unauthorized access to server files.
- The vendor released a patched version to address the vulnerability.
- The advisory notes that the vulnerability may not be exploitable in the free version of the extension if the "Send copy to sender" feature is not enabled, suggesting it might be limited to paid versions.
