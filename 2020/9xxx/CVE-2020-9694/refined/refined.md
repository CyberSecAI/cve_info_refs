Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9694

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JPEG2000 images in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. Specifically, the issue allows an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The core weakness is that the software writes data beyond the allocated buffer for processing the image. This write occurs due to insufficient checks on input data related to the JPEG2000 image format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This means an attacker can execute malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. This means the user has to open a malicious file (PDF likely containing a malicious JPEG2000 image) or visit a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files/Webpages:** An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF or webpage embedding a crafted JPEG2000 image that will trigger the out-of-bounds write.
- **Target User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the target user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage with the crafted image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as critical.
- Adobe has released updates to address this issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
