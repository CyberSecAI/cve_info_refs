Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9495:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient sanitization of user-provided input in the Apache Archiva login form, which is then used to construct LDAP queries. This lack of sanitization allows for LDAP injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **LDAP Injection:** The primary vulnerability is LDAP injection. By inserting special characters or crafted inputs into the login form (username or password), an attacker can manipulate the LDAP filter used to query user data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input received from the login form before using it in LDAP queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve arbitrary user attribute data from the connected LDAP server by manipulating the LDAP filter.
- **Data Exfiltration:** By measuring the response time of the queries, the attacker can infer information about the user's attributes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is the login form of the Apache Archiva application. Attackers can enter specially crafted inputs into the username or password fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Apache Archiva server and the ability to send HTTP requests to the login endpoint.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is triggered before authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Apache Archiva before 2.2.5.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
- Mitigation involves upgrading to Apache Archiva version 2.2.5 or higher.
- The information disclosure is achieved by measuring response times of the LDAP queries, indicating a time-based blind injection.
