Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to embed malicious content, specifically JavaScript, within Web Content and Visio tiles in the SquaredUp DS application. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied content.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be stored within the application through the Web Content and Visio tiles, which gets executed when a user views the dashboard.
    *   **Insecure iframe usage (Web Content):** The Web Content tile allowed embedding iframes that could point to malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Insecure SVG parsing (Visio):** The Visio tile allowed using SVGs that contained malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **JavaScript Execution in User's Session:**  When a user views a dashboard containing the malicious content, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browser, within the context of their session. This can be exploited for various malicious purposes like session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting to phishing pages.
    *   **Credential theft:**  A malicious page could emulate a session timeout and prompt for user credentials, potentially leading to credential theft.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Web Content Tile:** An attacker, with the ability to create dashboards, can insert an iframe within a Web Content tile, pointing to a malicious JavaScript page.
    *   **Visio Tile:** An attacker, with the ability to create dashboards, can use a Visio tile with an SVG image containing malicious scripts.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a SquaredUp DS user with the ability to create dashboards.

The document also outlines the fix:
*   JavaScript is now blocked from iframes in Web Content tiles.
*   A purifier for SVG images has been implemented to ensure the image is free from malicious scripts.

The affected versions of SquaredUp DS for SCOM and Azure are those earlier than 4.6, and the resolved versions are 4.6 and later.
