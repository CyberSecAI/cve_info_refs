# CVE-2020-9390 - Stored cross-site scripting (Web Content and Visio tile)

**CVE:** [CVE-2020-9390](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9390)

## [Description](#description)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) enable attackers to bring malicious content into a website or application.

Before SquaredUp DS version 4.6, stored XSS was possible for Web Content and Visio tiles. Exploiting this vulnerability was possible for SquaredUp DS users who can create dashboards.

Users could create a dashboard with a Web Content tile that embeds an iframe pointing to malicious JavaScript. For example, it was possible to point to a page that emulates session timeout and asks for credentials when a user views the dashboard.

Users could also create a dashboard with a Visio tile that uses an SVG with malicious script to execute in a user's session. Whenever a user would view a dashboard with the malicious content, the JavaScript would be executed in the context of their browser.

**Fix**

JavaScript is now blocked from iframes in Web Content tiles.

A purifier for SVG images has been implemented to ensure the image is free from malicious scripts.

**What should you do?**

If you are using a SquaredUp DS version earlier than 4.6, update to version 4.6 or later.
