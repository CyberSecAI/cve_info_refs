  "CVE-2020-9430": {
    "description": "The WiMax DLMAP dissector could crash due to an out-of-bounds read when processing a malformed packet.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing length validation in the WiMax DLMAP dissector, where an out-of-bounds read can occur when the mac_len is not greater than sizeof(mac_crc) while calculating a CRC32 checksum.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Missing length validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network",
      "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send or receive network packets."
