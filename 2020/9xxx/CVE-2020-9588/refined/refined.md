- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Observable Timing Discrepancy
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Signature verification bypass
- **Impact of exploitation**: Signature verification bypass leading to potential compromise of the system/application
- **Attack vectors**:  Not explicitly specified, but can be inferred to involve manipulating or observing timing discrepancies during signature verification.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  No pre-authentication is needed but administrative privileges are required.
