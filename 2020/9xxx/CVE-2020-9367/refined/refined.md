- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the way Endpoint Central MSP accesses external libraries through EXE files using qualified paths. When the specified DLL is not found, the system searches for it using standard methods.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL Hijacking due to insecure DLL loading mechanism. If a directory with write permissions exists for normal users in the DLL search path, an attacker can replace a legitimate DLL file with a malicious one of the same name.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL file.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker places a malicious DLL in a directory with write permissions that is searched when a specific DLL is not found using the qualified path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs write access to at least one directory that is part of the DLL search path of the application.
