- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free condition exists where the system references memory after it has been freed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick the user into running a crafted application with high privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to create a malicious application with high privileges that can be installed and run by a user on a vulnerable Huawei smartphone. The user must be tricked into running this application.
