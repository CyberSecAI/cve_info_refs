- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application's database or file system and then executed in the browsers of other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the stored XSS vulnerability to disclose sensitive information by injecting malicious scripts that execute when a user views the compromised content.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application which are then stored and later executed when a user views the content. This can occur through various input points within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious script into the application, this vulnerability requires no admin privileges.
