{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `diraliases` linked list handling within Pure-FTPd. Specifically, the `lookup_alias` and `print_aliases` functions fail to properly detect the end of the linked list, potentially leading to an attempt to access a non-existent list member. This is due to an issue in the `init_aliases` function, where the `next` pointer of the last item in the list is not always set to `NULL`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized pointer",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could trigger this vulnerability, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or information disclosure. The out-of-bounds memory read may expose sensitive information to the attacker.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending specially crafted input to the FTP server, potentially via the `lookup_alias` or `print_aliases` functions. The specific input required to trigger the vulnerability is not described.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable FTP server and send commands that will cause the vulnerable functions to be executed."
