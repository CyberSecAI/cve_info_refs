Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9706

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `updateFeed` method within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- Specifically, there's a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read. The software reads data from memory locations that are outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
- Information Disclosure: Due to the out-of-bounds read, an attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successfully exploiting the vulnerability can allow an attacker to leak sensitive information.
- The advisory mentions that an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with others to execute code. However, this specific CVE is limited to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious page or file.
- The user is required to interact with the malicious content (visit a malicious page or open a malicious file) to trigger the vulnerability.
- It can be classified as a remote attack vector as the user is interacting with an attacker-supplied file or a web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious file or host a malicious page that can be opened by the victim.
- No special privileges are needed since user interaction with the malicious content is the attack vector.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS score is 3.3 with an attack vector of "Local", which is inconsistent with the description. According to the advisory the user needs to interact with a malicious file or webpage, which would classify it as a remote attack vector.
- The Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) is credited for discovering this vulnerability.
