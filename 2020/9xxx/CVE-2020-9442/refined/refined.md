Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from overly permissive folder permissions in the "C:\ProgramData\OpenVPN Connect" directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Folder Permissions:** The "C:\ProgramData\OpenVPN Connect" folder allows write access to non-administrative users.
- **DLL Hijacking:** The `tapinstall.exe` process, which is part of the OpenVPN Connect installation, is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. It searches for specific DLL files in the same directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can achieve SYSTEM-level privileges on the compromised machine.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious DLL in the vulnerable directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Malicious DLL Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious DLL into the vulnerable directory.
- **Installation or Upgrade Trigger:** The malicious DLL is loaded when the OpenVPN Connect client is installed or upgraded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Non-Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have non-administrative user access to the target machine.
- **Write Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write files to the "C:\ProgramData\OpenVPN Connect\drivers\tap\amd64\win10" folder.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable path where the DLL is searched for.
- **Malicious DLL Creation:** The attacker needs the capability to create a malicious DLL that will execute desired shellcode upon loading.

**Technical Details:**
- The `tapinstall.exe` process loads DLLs such as `DEVRTL.dll`, `SPINF.dll`, `drvstore.dll`, `DEVOBJ.dll`, `newdev.dll`, and `VCRUNTIME140.dll`.
- By placing a malicious `drvstore.dll` in "C:\ProgramData\OpenVPN Connect\drivers\tap\amd64\win10", the attacker can get the malicious code executed.
- The vulnerability was present in OpenVPN Connect for Windows (MSI) version 3.1.0.361.
- A fix was implemented in version 3.1.1 (378) beta, which addresses the insecure location of installation files.

The provided information gives a clear understanding of how the vulnerability can be exploited, the impact of the vulnerability, and the steps an attacker would need to take to gain elevated privileges.
