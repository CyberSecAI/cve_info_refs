Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The NiFi Registry application, when using an authentication mechanism other than PKI, would invalidate the authentication token only on the client-side after a user clicked "Log Out." The server-side token remained valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incomplete session invalidation: The server-side token was not being invalidated upon logout, leading to a session management vulnerability.
- Insecure token handling: The client-side token, despite being invalidated locally, could still be used for API requests as long as the server-side token was valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker could potentially use a captured client-side token (obtained after the user logs out but before the server-side token expires) to make unauthorized API requests to the NiFi Registry. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modification, or deletion of data, depending on the permissions associated with the captured token.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Token capture: An attacker could obtain the token through various means such as network sniffing, compromised client machine or browser, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
- Replay attack: The attacker would then replay the captured token in API requests to the NiFi Registry server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a valid client-side token of a logged-out user.
- The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to the NiFi Registry server using the captured token.
- No specific network position is required (could be remote)
- No special user permissions are required besides having had logged into NiFi Registry.

**Additional Details:**
- The server-side token would remain valid for up to 12 hours after logout.
- The vulnerability is specific to NiFi Registry versions 0.1.0 to 0.5.0
- The fix, implemented in NiFi Registry 0.6.0, invalidates the server-side authentication token immediately upon logout.
- This vulnerability is related to insecure session management in an application that does not properly invalidate authentication tokens.
