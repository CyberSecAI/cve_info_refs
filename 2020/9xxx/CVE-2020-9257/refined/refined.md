- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs when handling certain certificate operations, where software accesses data outside the intended buffer boundaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation may lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires a user to install a malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application. They do not need any special network position.
