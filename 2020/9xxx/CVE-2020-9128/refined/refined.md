Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-9128:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of an insecure encryption algorithm in certain Huawei products.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is the implementation of a weak encryption algorithm, which is susceptible to attacks and does not adequately protect sensitive information.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure (information leak). An attacker can gain access to sensitive data that is intended to be protected by the faulty encryption.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack requires the attacker to first gain access to the affected product.
    *   The vulnerability is exploitable by attackers with high permissions.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have gained access to the affected Huawei product.
    *   The attacker requires high-level permissions within the compromised system to exploit the insecure encryption algorithm.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected product is FusionCompute version 8.0.0, with a fix provided in version 8.0.1
*   The vulnerability was discovered internally by Huawei.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 4.1 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating a local attack vector with high privileges needed to perform the attack, resulting in high confidentiality impact.
*   The CVSS v3 temporal score is 3.8 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
