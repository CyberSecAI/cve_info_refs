Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Out-of-bounds write

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability lies in an out-of-bounds write condition within Adobe Photoshop. This means the software attempts to write data to a memory location outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This means an attacker could gain control of the user's system, potentially installing malware, stealing data, or performing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The document does not specify the attack vector but it can be inferred that an attacker would need to exploit a malformed file or input to trigger the out-of-bounds write condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to craft a malicious file or input that, when processed by vulnerable versions of Adobe Photoshop, would trigger the out-of-bounds write.
*   The attacker would need to get the targeted user to open this file or input.
