  "CVE-2020-9308": {
    "description": "It was discovered that libarchive incorrectly handled certain archive files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a crash resulting in a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.10.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by libarchive failing to properly validate the header size field in RAR5 archive files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of RAR5 header size",
        "Lack of proper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted RAR5 archive with an invalid header size could lead to a crash (SIGSEGV), resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted RAR5 archive file."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious RAR5 archive file with an invalid header size and trick a user into processing it with a vulnerable version of libarchive.",
    "additional_details": "The minimum header size for RAR5 base blocks is 7 bytes, including a 4-byte CRC and 3 bytes for the rest of the header. The vulnerability occurs when libarchive encounters a RAR5 file declaring a header size of 0, which leads to a crash."
