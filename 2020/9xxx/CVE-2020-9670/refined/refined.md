Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9670

**Description:**

This CVE relates to a symlink vulnerability in the Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application for Windows.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a symlink vulnerability within the application. This means the application improperly handles symbolic links, which are special types of files that point to other files or directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symlink vulnerability:** The core weakness is the application's flawed handling of symlinks. This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths and potentially redirect operations to unexpected locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation, meaning an attacker could gain higher levels of access on the system than they should normally have.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is the exploitation of the symlink vulnerability present in the Creative Cloud Desktop application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to be able to influence the file paths used by the application through the use of symlinks. This likely means the attacker has some degree of access or control over the system, as symbolic link creation typically requires at least user-level access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application versions 5.1 and earlier for Windows.
- The advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities addressed in the same update (CVE-2020-9669, CVE-2020-9671, and CVE-2020-9682), which all relate to privilege escalation, and arbitrary file system writes.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 5.2 of the Creative Cloud Desktop Application.
