Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `deluser.php` page in PHP MyChat Plus 1.98 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `pmc_username` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication, making it accessible to anyone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database including usernames and password hashes.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly stated, SQL injection can potentially be used to modify or delete data in the database as well depending on the permissions of the underlying database user.
*   **System Compromise:** Depending on the application's database access and the database system, it may be possible for an attacker to elevate privileges or execute system commands.
*   **Denial of Service:** The time-based SQL injection can cause delays in execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `deluser.php` page. The malicious SQL payload is injected through the `pmc_username` parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and no other authentication or privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided content includes example payloads for different types of SQL injection: boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind injections, which indicate the level of control an attacker can achieve on the database interaction.
*   SQLMap can be used to automate the exploitation process.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `deluser.php` page.
*   The `pmc_username` parameter in the POST request is the injection point.
*   The provided CVSS score is 9.9 (Critical).
