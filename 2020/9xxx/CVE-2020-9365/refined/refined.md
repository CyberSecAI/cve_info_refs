Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `pure_strcmp` function in the `utils.c` file of Pure-FTPd.
- The function incorrectly calculates the length of strings being compared leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The `pure_strcmp` function in `utils.c` attempts to read memory beyond the bounds of the input strings.
- The original implementation of `pure_strcmp` used `strlen(s1) + 1U` as the size argument for `pure_memcmp`, but `s2` could be longer than `s1` which leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads can potentially expose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing crafted strings to the `pure_strcmp` function. This could occur through various parts of the FTP server that utilize string comparisons.
- The attack vector is remote since a malicious client could send specially crafted FTP commands that cause the server to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server.
- **Knowledge of Trigger:** The attacker needs to have some understanding of how to craft input that will cause the vulnerable `pure_strcmp` to read out of bounds.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Pure-FTPd version 1.0.49.
- The provided commit `36c6d268cb190282a2c17106acfd31863121b58e` and `bf6fcd4935e95128cf22af5924cdc8fe5c0579da` on GitHub contain the fix for the issue, and they show the evolution of the fix.
- The Gentoo bug report and security advisory confirms the vulnerability and the patch.
- Fedora also issued an update to address this issue (mentioned in the mailing list archives).
- RedHat bugzilla confirms the vulnerability and provides links to the fix.
