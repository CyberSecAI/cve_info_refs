Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-9524:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in Micro Focus Enterprise Server (including the Enterprise Server component of Enterprise Developer). Specifically, a number of pages contain Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) opportunities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which exists in both stored and reflected forms.
  - **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when an administrator views pages containing the malicious data.
  - **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can craft malicious links that, when followed by an administrator, execute malicious scripts in the administrator's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized administrative actions:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger administrative actions within the Enterprise Server environment. This could lead to unauthorized configuration changes, data manipulation, or other malicious activities that could compromise the server's security and functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious data injection (Stored XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious code via input fields or other mechanisms where data is stored and later displayed in administrative interfaces.
- **Malicious links (Reflected XSS):** Attackers can craft and distribute malicious URLs. When an administrator clicks on such a link, the malicious script is executed in the administrator's browser in the context of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low privilege access:** The attacker needs low-level access to the system to inject malicious data or craft malicious URLs. The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker must have low privileges on the system.
- **Social engineering:**  For reflected XSS attacks, the attacker must be able to socially engineer an administrator to click on the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of Micro Focus Enterprise Developer and Enterprise Server prior to version 5.0 Patch Update 8.
- The provided document thanks Micha≈Ç Skowron (ING Tech Poland) for finding and responsibly disclosing the vulnerability.
- Mitigation steps include enabling TLS (SSL) for the web interface, requiring user authentication for the Enterprise Server Administration (MFDS) web interface, and installing the appropriate patch update.
