Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an operating system (OS) command injection flaw in Rubrik CDM when restoring VMware virtual machines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection:**  An authenticated attacker can inject and execute arbitrary Linux commands on a Rubrik CDM managed VMware virtual machine during file restore operations using the VMware Tools recovery method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with sufficient privileges could execute arbitrary Linux commands on the target VM, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration/modification
    - System compromise
    - Denial of service
    - Further lateral movement within the network

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during file restore operations of Linux VMware virtual machines.
- The restore must be performed using the VMware Tools recovery method.
- Exploitation requires a compromised Rubrik cluster account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have access to an account on the Rubrik cluster.
- **Privileges:** This account must have either administrator privileges or end user privileges with the "Allow Overwrite of Original" option enabled for the restore target.
- **Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to initiate a file restore operation.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- **Affected systems:** Only VMware virtual machines running Linux protected by Rubrik CDM are potentially impacted.
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Rubrik CDM 5.1.2 or CDM 5.0.4-p1.
- **Unaffected restore method:** Recovering files with the Rubrik Backup Service (RBS) is *not* impacted by this vulnerability.
- **Vulnerability Reporting:** This vulnerability was reported by S21sec, a cybersecurity company.
