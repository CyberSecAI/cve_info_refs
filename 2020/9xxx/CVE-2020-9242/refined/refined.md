Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9242

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters sent via POST requests. This lack of proper validation allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before passing it to the system's command interpreter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. This could lead to:
    * **Complete System Compromise:** Gaining full control of the server, leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing the system to become unstable or unresponsive.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Potentially using the compromised system as a launchpad for further attacks within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Web Portal:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web portal interface of the FusionCompute product.
* **HTTP POST Requests:** Malicious input is sent via HTTP POST requests to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the FusionCompute system. This suggests that the attack requires prior knowledge of a valid user account.
* **Web Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web portal of the FusionCompute system to send the malicious HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
* **Affected Product:** Huawei FusionCompute
* **Affected Version:** 8.0.0
* **Fixed Version:** 8.0.0.SPC1
* **CVSSv3 Score:** 7.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    * **AV:N:** Network attack vector
    * **AC:L:** Low attack complexity
    * **PR:H:** High privileges required
    * **UI:N:** No user interaction required
    * **S:U:** Unchanged scope
    * **C:H:** High impact on confidentiality
    * **I:H:** High impact on integrity
    * **A:H:** High impact on availability
