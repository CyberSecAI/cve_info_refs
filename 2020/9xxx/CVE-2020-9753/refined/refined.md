- Root cause of vulnerability: Whale Browser Installer versions before 2.6.88.19 do not verify the signature of the Flash installer.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of signature verification for the Flash installer.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially replace the legitimate Flash installer with a malicious one, leading to arbitrary code execution when the installer is run.
- Attack vectors: An attacker would need to replace the legitimate flash installer with a malicious one before the Whale Browser Installer uses it.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to have the ability to intercept or manipulate the flash installer before it's used by the Whale Browser installer.
