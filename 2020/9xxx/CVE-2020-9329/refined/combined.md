# Race condition can make MaxCreationLimit useless #5926

## Description

![@shouc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10573715?u=94f5c72772a4edc3c65190b044a523792029595e&v=4&size=48)[shouc](https://github.com/shouc)opened [on Feb 19, 2020](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/5926#issue-567743100)
## Description

Users could potentially create more repos than specified in MaxCreationLimit as NumRepos field is not updated in a race-condition-safe cavalier (i.e. row is not locked). Such logic error could be fatal in some specific settings.

## Reason

internal/db/repo.go:1108

```
func CreateRepository(doer, owner *User, opts CreateRepoOptions) (_ *Repository, err error) {
        // check first
	if !owner.CanCreateRepo() {
		return nil, errors.ReachLimitOfRepo{owner.RepoCreationNum()}
	}
        // some time-consuming operations
        ...
        // update numrepo
        if err = createRepository(sess, doer, owner, repo); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
        ...
}
```
## PoC

Execute following script in the console of the user:

```
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].forEach((v)=>{$.post("/repo/create", "_csrf=[YOUR CSRF TOKEN]&user_id=[YOUR ID]&repo_name=ccc" + v +"&description=&gitignores=&license=&readme=Default")})
```

The resultant NumRepos is less than 10 (it is 2~4 in my settings) though 10 repos are created.

## Solution

Indeed, some other fields also need locking but are not that crucial to the integrity of the system.

```
type User struct {
    ...
    NumFollowers int // <- add optimistic lock here
    NumFollowing int `xorm:"NOT NULL DEFAULT 0"` // <- add optimistic lock here
    NumStars     int // <- add optimistic lock here
    NumRepos   int // <- add optimistic lock here
    ...
}
```

Or stop using fields in user table to save the value as it could be counted directly by using repository table.
