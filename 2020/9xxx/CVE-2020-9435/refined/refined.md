Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded, private X.509 certificate and key embedded within the firmware of the affected Phoenix Contact devices. This certificate is used by default for the web-based services of the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798):** The device ships with a pre-installed, generic X.509 certificate and its corresponding private key. This certificate is not unique to each device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Impersonation:** An attacker can use the hardcoded certificate to impersonate the legitimate device.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept and decrypt communications between a user and the device.
-   **Passive Decryption:** An attacker can decrypt captured traffic that was encrypted using the default certificate.
-   **Access to Sensitive Information:** By intercepting traffic, attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information such as:
    - Admin credentials
    - Configuration parameters
    - Status information.
-  This information can be used to perform further attacks against the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network-based Attacks:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network if they are in a position to intercept communication between a user and the affected device.
-   The vulnerability is exploitable against the web interface of the devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the targeted device or have the ability to intercept network traffic to and from the device.
-   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to perform a passive decryption or impersonation attacks.
- **MitM position:** An attacker would need to be in a Man-in-the-Middle position to intercept the traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Phoenix Contact TC Router and TC Cloud Client models as detailed in the provided content.
*   The provided content includes the actual private key which increases the risk posed by this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was found by Thomas Weber of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
* The vendor is shipping the devices with unique certificates in future releases as a solution.
