Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9283:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package, specifically during SSH signature verification.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

*   The `golang.org/x/crypto` package allows a panic to occur during signature verification in the SSH package.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing an invalid public key during the signature verification process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a panic, effectively crashing the affected SSH server or client. This results in a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   A client can attack an SSH server that accepts public keys
*   A server can attack any SSH client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the SSH protocol, specifically during the public key authentication process.
*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an SSH server (or client) a specially crafted or invalid public key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate an SSH connection to a vulnerable server or client.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to supply a malicious or invalid public key during the key exchange process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content suggests that multiple Debian packages, like `restic` and `packer`, were affected due to their reliance on the vulnerable `golang-go.crypto` library. These packages needed to be recompiled to pick up the fix.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package, which is used by other applications for secure communication.

In summary, CVE-2020-9283 describes a vulnerability in the golang SSH library that can cause a panic and denial of service if an invalid public key is used during signature verification. This impacts both SSH servers and clients.
