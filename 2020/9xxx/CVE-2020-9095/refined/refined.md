- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Some functions lack verification when processing messages from other modules, leading to an integer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can cause a compromise of normal service on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious messages to the affected device's module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the affected device is required.
