- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an improper interface design within a module of the affected Huawei product. Specifically, the module interface does not handle certain operations correctly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the improper handling of operations by a module interface. This leads to the possibility of malicious operations being performed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can perform malicious actions that compromise the module service. This could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a module interface. An attacker needs to have network access to the affected product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable product.  A low level of privileges is required (PR:L). The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
