Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-9712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a bypass of JavaScript API restrictions within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC's Web2PDF functionality. Specifically, it lies within a hidden menu item.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **JavaScript API Restriction Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to circumvent the intended limitations placed on JavaScript APIs within the application.
*   **Arbitrary HTML Parsing:** Through specific JavaScript actions, an attacker can force the application to parse arbitrary HTML documents. This is a critical vulnerability since it allows an attacker to introduce malicious content into the parsing process

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:**  The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. The advisory states, "An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process." This implies that while this vulnerability itself may not directly achieve code execution, it serves as a crucial step, or enabler, when combined with other attack vectors.
*   **Security Feature Bypass**: The vulnerability allows for bypassing of security features of the software, classified as "Security feature bypass" in the Adobe bulletin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages/Files:** The attack requires user interaction. The target must visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file (presumably a PDF or related document) containing the exploit.
*   **JavaScript Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate JavaScript code within the malicious page/file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Hidden Menu Item:** The vulnerability lies in a hidden menu item, making it less obvious and more difficult for users to detect or avoid.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Content:** An attacker must be capable of creating malicious web pages or files that can execute JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to interact with the malicious content, either by visiting a webpage or opening a file. The user's actions are required for the exploit to occur.
*   **Knowledge of Adobe Acrobat API:** Detailed understanding of the Javascript API in Adobe Acrobat and how to manipulate it is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the Web2PDF feature of Acrobat Pro DC, indicating that the PDF conversion process is involved.
*   The vulnerability requires a combination with other vulnerabilities in order to achieve code execution.
*   Adobe has released security updates to address this vulnerability.
