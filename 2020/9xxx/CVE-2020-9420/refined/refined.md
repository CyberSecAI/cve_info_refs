The provided content relates to CVE-2020-9420.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Arcadyan router uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, resulting in cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of insecure HTTP protocol for communication.
- Cleartext transmission of user credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can sniff wireless modem user credentials.
- Compromise of device through injected malicious code.
- Ability to inject persistent malicious scripts into the web interface of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: Malicious users on the same network as the router.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept the cleartext traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Arcadyan router.
- Ability to passively monitor network traffic.
