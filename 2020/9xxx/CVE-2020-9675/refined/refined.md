Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9675

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing 3GP files in Adobe Bridge. This inadequate validation allows for a read past the end of an allocated structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: The software attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer/memory region due to a lack of proper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Malicious 3GP File: An attacker could craft a malicious 3GP file designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
  - User Interaction: User interaction is needed, such as opening the malicious 3GP file, or visiting a malicious webpage that leads to the execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to open the crafted 3GP file or to visit a webpage serving the malicious file. The attacker can be remote, so physical proximity to the target is not required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Bridge version 10.0.3 and earlier.
- Adobe has released an update (version 10.1.1) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- This is a critical severity vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 7.8 which is considered high. The vector is AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating that local access is needed, user interaction is required and the impact is high across all parameters of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
