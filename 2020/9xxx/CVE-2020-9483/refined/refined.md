Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the previous SQL builder implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in three methods of its SQL implementation. The vulnerability was present in H2/MySQL database interaction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The specific impact of the SQL injection is not detailed in the provided content. Generally, SQL injection can allow an attacker to:
    - Bypass authentication and authorization
    - Read, modify, or delete sensitive data
    - Execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the SQL builder, which was not properly sanitizing input, and thus, allowed malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the system in a way that allows them to inject malicious SQL through the vulnerable SQL builder.
- The specific location of the injection point is not specified, but it's related to the "metrics query".

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content is a pull request that fixes a SQL injection vulnerability.
- The fix addresses three methods of SQL implementation.
- The fix was included in the 8.0.0 milestone.
