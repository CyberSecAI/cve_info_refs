Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the Elasticsearch implementation within Mahara. When the 'Isolated institutions' setting is enabled, user searches should be restricted to users within the same institution. However, due to a flaw, the search results included users from outside the user's institution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control in the Elasticsearch implementation. The system failed to enforce the restriction that should have been applied when 'Isolated institutions' was turned on.
- **Information Disclosure:** As a consequence of incorrect access control, user account details were exposed in search results to users who should not have had access to them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The main impact is the disclosure of account details of users outside a user's institution. This could potentially include names, usernames, and other profile information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker could trigger it through the standard user interface of the Mahara platform without needing local access.
- **User Search:** The vulnerability is triggered by performing a user search within Mahara.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user within the Mahara system.
- **Member of an Institution:** The attacker needs to be a member of an institution on a Mahara instance where the 'Isolated institutions' setting is enabled.

**Affected Versions:**
- Mahara versions 19.04 before 19.04.4 and 19.10 before 19.10.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability has been fixed in Mahara versions 19.04.5, 19.10.3, and 20.04.0
