Vulnerability Type

1.  Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format (CWE-257)
2.  Unverified Password Change (CWE-620)

Summary

1.  PACTware passwords are stored in a recoverable format
2.  PACTware passwords may be modified without knowing the current

password

Impact

PACTware supports ‘user roles’, which limit user access according to FDT Guide-
lines. By default, no passwords are set and the default user has the user role
‘admin’ with no limitations.
If the user enables role access control, each role may be protected with an indi-
vidual password.

These settings could be changed by a local user without any verification. This
means a local user may modify role enablement, and role passwords, without
authenticating first. (CVE-2020-9404)
The settings can be read by a local user with no verification. It is possible to
recover passwords for the roles, if passwords were previously set.
(CVE-2020-9403)
If the user has not enabled individual roles, an attacker may enable the roles
and assign passwords to them. This could block legitimate users from using the
software.

Solution

PACTware will protect the manipulation of stored passwords by using a salted
mechanism of password encryption with an additional SHA256 hash.
(CVE-2020-9403)
Any further changes in ‘user role’-administration will need a confirmation by
using the current login password. (CVE-2020-9404)

This will be fixed in following versions (and higher)
-  PACTware  5.0.5.31
-  PACTware  4.1 SP6

Overview about version history: https://pactware.com/de/service

You can protect yourself against manipulation by restricting the access to the
PC where PACTware is installed.

In case of not known passwords it can be reset by
- re-installation of PACTware (all PACTware versions).
