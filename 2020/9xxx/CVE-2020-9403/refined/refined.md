Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-9403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that PACTware stores passwords in a recoverable format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format (CWE-257):** Passwords are not properly encrypted or hashed, making them easily retrievable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker can recover the passwords for user roles if they were previously set. This allows the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access with the privileges associated with those roles, depending on the role's access limitations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires the attacker to have local access to the machine where PACTware is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local access to the machine where PACTware is installed. No specific user privileges beyond standard local user access are specified.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document explicitly states that by default, no passwords are set, and the default user has the 'admin' role with no limitations. If the user enables role access control, passwords can be set, which introduces the vulnerability.
*   The document provides a fix by implementing a salted mechanism of password encryption with an additional SHA256 hash.
