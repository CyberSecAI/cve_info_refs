The provided content contains two separate vulnerabilities with the same CVE ID, which is incorrect. This analysis will focus on the first vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of intents within Xiaomi GetApps. The application allows sending intents that are normally restricted, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly validate and restrict the intents, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **Impact:**  A local attacker can escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access is required. An attacker must first gain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. The specific attack vector is via sending a specially crafted intent to the vulnerable application.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device and be able to execute low-privileged code.

The second vulnerability, while having the same CVE ID in the content, is a different issue related to the Xiaomi Mi9 Browser and its handling of web page redirections, which will be ignored here since it is a distinct vulnerability.
