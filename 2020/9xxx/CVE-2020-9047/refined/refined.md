Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature** in the affected software. Specifically, the software fails to verify the cryptographic signature of data, which allows for the possibility of executing a malicious executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature:** The software does not properly validate cryptographic signatures. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass security checks and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker with administrative privileges to download and run a malicious executable, potentially leading to:
    - Execution of operating system commands on the system.
    - Compromise of the system's integrity and confidentiality.
    - Possible further malicious actions depending on the attacker's objectives.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs administrative privileges on the affected system.
- **User Interaction:** The attack involves a user action, such as downloading and executing a malicious file, and a user with admin rights is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely
- **Technical Skill:** High technical skills are needed to craft a malicious executable and take advantage of the lack of signature verification.
