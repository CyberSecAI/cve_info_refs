Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9370

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the session management functionality of the web-based interface of the HGA12R-02 router. The session IDs are not adequately protected, allowing an attacker to intercept and reuse them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure session management. Specifically, the session ID can be captured by a network sniffer (like Wireshark), meaning it is predictable and not adequately protected.
- Lack of proper session invalidation or protection mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can hijack a valid user session by capturing and using the session ID.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Once the session is hijacked, the attacker gains access to the router's web interface with the privileges of the legitimate user.
- **Device Control:** This access allows the attacker to control the device, potentially including creating new user accounts and changing configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** The primary attack vector involves capturing network traffic to extract the session ID. This likely assumes the attacker is on the same network, or can man-in-the-middle the traffic.
- **Replay Attack:** The attacker reuses the captured session ID to gain unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target device or have the capability to intercept network traffic to the router.
- **Network Monitoring Tools:** The attacker needs tools like Wireshark to capture network packets and extract the session ID.
- **Knowledge of the target device:** The attacker would need some knowledge to target the specific router.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the steps to exploit this vulnerability, including capturing the session ID with Wireshark and using it to gain access.
- The affected device is a HGA12R-02 Router, specifically a Humax product. The document from humaxdigital.com confirms that they make the HGA12R-02.
