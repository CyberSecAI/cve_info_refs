Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-9497:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper input validation** in the `guacamole-server` when handling RDP static virtual channels. Specifically, the `guac_rdpsnd_formats_handler` and `guac_rdp_ai_read_format` functions lack proper checks on the incoming data stream size, leading to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The server reads beyond the allocated buffer due to missing length checks on the incoming data stream. This occurs when processing specific messages within the `rdpsnd` and `guacai` channels.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read allows a malicious RDP server to potentially access sensitive memory regions of the `guacd` process, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially leak sensitive information from the memory of the `guacd` process by sending specially crafted RDP messages.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The information disclosure could potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities (like the use-after-free described in CVE-2020-9498) to achieve code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious or compromised RDP server sends specially crafted messages through RDP static virtual channels.
*   The vulnerable `guacamole-server` instances connect to the malicious RDP server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must control or have compromised an RDP server.
*   The `guacamole-server` must connect to this malicious RDP server.
* No interaction is required by the user connecting to the guacamole-server.

**Additional details:**

*   The `rdpsnd` channel (RDP Sound) and `guacai` (Audio Input) channels are specifically vulnerable.
*   The `guacai` channel is disabled by default but is still vulnerable if enabled.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Check Point Research.
*   The vulnerability was patched in `guacamole-server` version 1.2.0.
