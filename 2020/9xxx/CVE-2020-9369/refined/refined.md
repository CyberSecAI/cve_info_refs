{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Sympa web interface's handling of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens. Malformed CSRF tokens can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient CSRF token validation",
      "Improper handling of malformed parameters",
      "Excessive resource consumption (disk space, notifications)"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial of service (DoS). Specifically, an attacker can submit requests with malformed parameters, causing Sympa to create junk files in the temporary files directory, potentially leading to disk space exhaustion. Additionally, tampering with the CSRF token can trigger excessive notification messages to listmasters.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Submitting HTTP requests with malformed CSRF token parameters.",
       "Crafting requests that cause generation of junk files in the /tmp directory",
       "Manipulating the token to trigger multiple notifications to list masters."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Sympa web interface and manipulate parameters, including the CSRF token. No authentication is needed to send a malformed token.",
    "cve": "CVE-2020-9369"
  }
