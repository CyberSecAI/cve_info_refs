Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-9567

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Use-After-Free

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free, which means that the program is attempting to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, and potentially exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This means a successful exploit could allow an attacker to take complete control of the targeted computer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The provided document doesn't specify the exact attack vector. However, it does indicate that the vulnerability exists within Adobe Bridge. It can be inferred that an attacker would likely need to convince a user to open or interact with a specially crafted file or data within the Adobe Bridge application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to craft a malicious file or data that when processed by Adobe Bridge, would trigger the use-after-free vulnerability. This would require reverse engineering and knowledge of the internal workings of Adobe Bridge.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document lists multiple CVEs resolved in the same update, highlighting a range of vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Bridge.
- It also acknowledges the researcher who identified this vulnerability as "Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative"
