{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the `FolderName` parameter in the `Media.CreateFolder` command.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated user can inject malicious scripts into the `FolderName` parameter, which are then stored and executed when other users interact with the affected functionality. This could lead to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious payload, such as `<marquee/onstart=alert(\"XSS\")>`, and injects it into the `FolderName` parameter of the `Media.CreateFolder` command."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected application (Oempro v4.7 through 4.11)."
