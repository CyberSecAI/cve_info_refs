Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-9405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Online Weather application. Specifically, user-supplied input within a redirect request is directly reflected in the web page without any validation or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the presence of a reflected XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the application echoes user-provided data in the HTTP response without neutralizing potentially malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page. This injected script can perform various actions such as:
    - Stealing user cookies or session tokens, leading to account compromise.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by crafting a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction. A victim has to click on a specially crafted link or be redirected to a page with the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know where the user-supplied input is reflected to inject the malicious script.
- **Social Engineering (Likely):** Typically, attackers would use social engineering to trick users into clicking a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Product:** IBL Online Weather application.
- **Vulnerable Version:** 4.3.5
- **Fixed Version:** 4.3.5a
- **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
