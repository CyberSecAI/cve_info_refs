For aviation users, a standard suite of forms is available to cover the production of TAF, METAR, Aerodrome & Windshear warnings, or Special AIREP. A single entry form can result in multiple outputs (text, HTML, PDF, LibreOffice, JSON, XML), with the graphical quality limited only by the design effort invested. Results can be published on websites, social media, sent to newspapers, customers, or integrated into mobile & web applications.

* Web-based front-end for Visual Weather's Message Editor
* Output to TAC & IWXXM for aviation reports.
* First-guess values (NWP model data, calculations)
* Embedded guidance (model data, images, external sources)
* Validation to reduce format & logical consistency errors

* View detailed content and images within notifications
* Set and mute sound alerts for new notifications
* Print notifications with customisable print settings
## Web Services under the hood

Online Weather leverages web services like Web Map Service (WMS) and OGC Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) to efficiently process vast amounts of environmental data close to its source on the server side. By utilizing these services, complex calculations and data processing are performed directly on the server, significantly reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network. This approach ensures that the client application receives only the small, final results of these calculations, such as a specific weather map or precise environmental data for a chosen location. As a result, users benefit from fast, responsive access to detailed weather information without the need to handle or download large datasets, making the platform both efficient and scalable.
