- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device does not properly restrict certain data received from the WAN port.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper authorization, lack of input validation/filtering on data received from the WAN port.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker on the WAN side can manage certain services of the affected device. This could potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device and/or disrupt its operation.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker located on the WAN side can send malicious data to the vulnerable device via the WAN port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be located on the WAN side of the device.
