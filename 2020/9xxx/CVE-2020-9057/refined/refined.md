**Vulnerability Description:**

*   Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 100, 200, and 300 series chipsets do not support encryption.

**Affected Devices:**

*   Z-Wave devices using Silicon Labs 100, 200, and 300 series chipsets.

**Impact:**

*   An attacker within Z-Wave radio range can intercept and observe traffic, and control vulnerable devices.

**Root Cause:**

* Lack of encryption support in the specified Z-Wave chipsets.

**Mitigation:**
