- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A directory traversal vulnerability exists when loading a User-Defined Function (UDF) in Apache AsterixDB.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of directory entries within UDF zip files. Specifically, a zip file containing a directory entry named ".." allows files to be placed outside of the intended UDF deployment directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can write files outside the intended UDF deployment directory, potentially leading to arbitrary file creation and overwriting, which could result in further system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted zip file containing a malicious directory entry ("..") through the UDF endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to have access to the UDF endpoint to upload malicious zip files.
