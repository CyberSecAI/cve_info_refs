# Zulip Desktop 4.0.3 security release

  [![](/_astro/tabbott.Y0j5haym_Z1qaMxj.webp)](author/tabbott/)  [Tim Abbott](author/tabbott/)   Feb 29, 2020 • 2 min read

Today we released Zulip Desktop 4.0.3, fixing a critical security issue:

* CVE-2020-9443: Web security was disabled in the Electron webview.

This is a critical security issue because Zulip’s security model for uploaded
files relies on the browser (in this case Electron) enforcing the web security
model. Huge thanks to Matt Austin for reporting this issue. We have not
completed our postmortem, but I expect we will be making major changes in how
the Electron desktop app is maintained in response to this issue.

## Upgrading

Because the desktop app updates automatically, many users have already have
upgraded to this new version.

However, Zulip Desktop 2.3.82, released in late 2018, had buggy auto-update
functionality and will not auto-update (while claiming it’s up-to-date), and
some users are still using that release. To help users running Zulip Desktop
2.3.82, we have implemented a large, red notice at the top of the Zulip UI
telling them that auto-update is broken and they need to download the latest app
from <https://zulipchat.com/apps>.

This notice was deployed to zulipchat.com today, and will be included in the
Zulip Server 2.1.3 release scheduled for next week.

### For server administrators

Server administrators who want the notice on their installation now can get it
by installing the “2.1.x” branch that we use to stage changes planned for the
next minor release (current
[changelog](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/2.1.x/docs/overview/changelog.md)).
You can update your installation to the 2.1.x branch using the following
command:

`/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/upgrade-zulip-from-git 2.1.x`

See
[the server upgrade documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository)
for details on upgrading to pre-release versions of the Zulip server. I should
mention that we support installations running stable release branches (like
2.1.x) as though they were running a release, so don’t be discouraged from
updating because of concerns about support.
