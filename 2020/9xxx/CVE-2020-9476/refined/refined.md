Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9476:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Arris tg1692a router firmware 9.1.103DE2 does not sufficiently protect administrator credentials. Specifically, the administrator password is included in the response of the `/login` page in base64 encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive information (administrator credentials) in an easily decodable format (base64).
- Insufficient credential protection: The firmware fails to implement proper security measures to protect administrator passwords during the login process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: An attacker who can intercept network traffic during the login process can obtain administrator credentials.
- Full control of the device: With admin access, the attacker can fully control the router, potentially modifying settings, changing DNS, creating backdoors, and performing other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network sniffing: A remote attacker can capture packets during the login process by intercepting network traffic.
- Man-in-the-middle: An attacker positioned between the user and the router can intercept the HTTP response containing the encoded credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have the ability to intercept network traffic going to or from the router. This can be done by being on the same LAN or via a man-in-the-middle attack.
- Packet capture tool: The attacker requires a tool to capture and analyze network traffic (e.g., Wireshark) to intercept the HTTP response from the `/login` page.
