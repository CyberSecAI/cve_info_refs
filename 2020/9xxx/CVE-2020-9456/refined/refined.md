Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-9456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The RegistrationMagic plugin failed to implement proper access controls, capability checks, and nonce verifications for various administrative and user-facing functionalities. This allowed unauthorized users to access sensitive features.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authenticated Privilege Escalation:**
    - Lack of capability checks and nonce verifications in the user editing form.
    - Attackers could modify their user role to administrator by manipulating the `rm_slug` and `user_id` parameters.

2.  **CSRF to Settings Modification:**
    -  Absence of nonce checks in administrative functions related to plugin settings.
    - Attackers could forge requests on behalf of administrators to change settings, delete users, add new user roles, or enable PHP file uploads.

3.  **Authenticated Email Injection:**
    - Unprotected AJAX action `send_email_ajax` did not include capability or nonce checks.
    - Subscribers could send arbitrary emails from the site to any email address.

4.  **Authenticated Settings and User Data Export:**
     - Lack of access control and nonce checks in the form export function
     - Attackers could export all forms, including all submitted data, using the `rm_form_export` slug.

5.  **Authenticated Settings Import -> Privilege Escalation:**
    -  Unprotected AJAX actions allowed uploading of customized forms, setting form expiry, and setting default forms
    - Attackers could import a malicious form, set it to expire a currently used form and then use it to register a new administrator user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete Site Takeover:** Through privilege escalation, attackers could gain full administrative control of the WordPress site.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could export all submitted form data, exposing sensitive information.
- **Spam/Phishing:** Attackers could send arbitrary emails for malicious purposes.
- **Site Defacement/Malware Upload:** Attackers could modify settings to enable PHP file uploads, allowing them to upload backdoors or malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct access to /rm_submissions page:** Used to exploit the privilege escalation and data export vulnerabilities by sending requests with specific parameters.
- **Crafted POST requests:** Used to exploit CSRF vulnerabilities, by forging requests on behalf of site administrators.
- **Unprotected AJAX actions:** Exploited to send emails, import forms, set default forms, and upload malicious forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Subscriber-level access:** Required for privilege escalation, email injection, settings, and user data export.
-   **Knowledge of the plugin's functionality:** Necessary to craft the required requests.
-   **Ability to forge requests:** Needed to perform CSRF attacks.
