The provided content details a post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Centreon 19.10.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is triggered by an insecure parameter passed to a command execution function within the web application. The specific vulnerable code isn't provided, however the blog post shows that the web server logs reveal a command execution attempt via the `cmd` parameter in a POST request to `/centreon/include/configuration/conf.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Command Execution:** The application is executing a command based on user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation.
- **POST Request Vulnerability:** The command execution is initiated via a POST request, indicating the vulnerability lies in how the application handles form data or similar user-supplied input through HTTP POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Centreon application.
- **Complete System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary commands, an attacker can gain control of the entire server and access sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/centreon/include/configuration/conf.php` including the vulnerable `cmd` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Centreon web application to exploit this vulnerability (Post-Auth RCE).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Centreon web server to send the crafted HTTP POST request.

**Additional Technical Details**
The blog post demonstrates the exploit by using `cmd` parameter in a POST request, passing a base64 encoded reverse shell to the vulnerable endpoint. This confirms the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The author also mentions that a root shell may be obtainable through further exploitation.
