The content provides details about multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Codoforum, and while it mentions CVE-2020-9007, it doesn't specify which vulnerability this CVE refers to. It describes the following vulnerabilities:

**1. Reflected XSS in Topic Title:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied topic titles when rendering them, resulting in direct injection of HTML.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by crafting a malicious topic title.
    *   **Attack Vector:** User creates a new topic with a malicious title, then the XSS is triggered when the page is loaded.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs a user account in the application to create a new topic.

**2. Stored XSS in Post Tags:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied post tags, allowing for the injection of HTML attributes with JavaScript code.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the victim moves the mouse over the tags.
    *   **Attack Vector:** User creates a post with malicious tags. The XSS is triggered on mouse over event.

    *   **Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by crafting a malicious URL, which then is activated when the victim uses the specific accesskey.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker provides a crafted URL, and the XSS is triggered when the user uses Alt+Shift+X.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to visit the crafted URL and use the accesskey.
