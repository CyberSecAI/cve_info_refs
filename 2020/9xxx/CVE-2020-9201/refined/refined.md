- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in several Huawei products when parsing DHCP messages with a crafted parameter. The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can cause certain service abnormalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be on the same adjacent network as the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have access to the victim's adjacent network to send specially crafted DHCP messages.

The advisory provides details on the affected products and versions, as well as the fixed versions. It also includes the CVSSv3 score and temporal score, along with technical details and the conditions required for exploitation.
