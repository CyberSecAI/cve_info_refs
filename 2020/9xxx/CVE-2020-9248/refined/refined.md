Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an improper authorization vulnerability within Huawei FusionCompute. A specific module fails to properly verify input, leading to incorrect file access authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper authorization: The system does not correctly validate input, resulting in unauthorized access to files.
- Privilege escalation: Attackers can exploit the improper authorization to gain elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain higher access levels than they should have
- Compromise of normal service, which could disrupt functionality or availability of the system

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local system access: An attacker must already have access to the local system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the local system where the vulnerable FusionCompute instance is running.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the specific input that causes the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Huawei FusionCompute version 8.0.0.
- A patch (version 8.0.0.SPC1) has been released to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 6.7 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating high impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- The temporal score is 6.2 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C), meaning exploitation is functional and the vulnerability is confirmed with complete remediation.
