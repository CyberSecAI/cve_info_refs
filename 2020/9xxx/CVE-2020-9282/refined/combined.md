### Bug Description

When you are on view/access.php?id=[page ID] and open the network connections (you will need to reload the page to see traffic come through), you can see more information about an account holder than you should:

1. Open the "Network" tab.

2. Click on acces.json.php.

3. Show the "Response" information.

Username and other personal information is disclosed that should not be displayed is shown and thus can mean that information about other people can be leaked.

When we compose a message in the inbox, that same sort of disclosure does not happen. So, sendmessage.json.php handles things in a better way.

We should only disclose as much information in the "Response" as we do in the select menu, i.e. use the normal display name function as some people may not want to share their first and last name. Things will be different depending on their role.

It would be good to check the other places that use the Select2 name drop-down and double-check that they are safe.

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

In our podcast 'Create. Share. Engage.' portfolio practitioners, researchers, learning designers, and portfolio authors share their journey. Learn how they navigate the many different facets of portfolios in general, and Mahara specifically.
