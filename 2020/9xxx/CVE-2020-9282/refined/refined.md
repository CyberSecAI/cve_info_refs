Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-9282:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the disclosure of excessive personal information via the `access.json.php` endpoint when a user is on the `view/access.php` page and opens network connections (specifically, by inspecting the "Response" data of the `access.json.php` request). This endpoint was returning more user data than necessary, which should only be as much as shown in the select menu.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The system reveals usernames and other personal information in the AJAX response that should not be exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Leakage of personal information of account holders. This could include usernames, first and last names which users may not want to share.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves navigating to a specific page (`view/access.php?id=[page ID]`) and using browser developer tools to inspect network traffic.
- Specifically, the attacker needs to examine the "Response" data from the `access.json.php` request to view the excessive personal information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Mahara platform to access the 'Edit access' screen when sharing portfolios.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses.
- They must have some knowledge of how to locate the specific ajax request and view the response.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involved limiting the type of data returned in ajax calls to mitigate the risk.
- The vulnerability was present in Mahara versions 18.10 before 18.10.5, 19.04 before 19.04.4, and 19.10 before 19.10.2.
- The issue was resolved by limiting the data returned in the ajax calls in commit `75a96408975052001eee7caa711fe8c005d34c85`.
- Other places that use the Select2 name drop-down were recommended to be checked for similar vulnerabilities.
