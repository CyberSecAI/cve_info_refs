The provided content relates to CVE-2020-9447.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of filenames in the file upload functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because the application does not sanitize filenames before rendering them in the user interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:

*   Session hijacking
*   Stealing sensitive information
*   Defacement of the website
*   Malware distribution
*   Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the file upload functionality where the user uploads a file with a malicious filename.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the vulnerable application. They must also have the ability to craft a filename containing JavaScript code.
