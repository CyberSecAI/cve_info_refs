Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-9676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the processing of MP4 files in Adobe Bridge.
- It stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The improper validation allows a write operation to occur past the end of an allocated memory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
