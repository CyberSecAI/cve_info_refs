Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9757:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input passed to the `metacontainers` controller within the SEOmatic plugin for Craft CMS. Specifically, malformed data in the `uri` parameter could lead to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection):** The primary weakness is that the application renders user input as a template, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  An earlier, related issue allowed for XSS due to malformed data. Although the primary focus of the provided information is SSTI, it is mentioned that malformed data can lead to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The SSTI vulnerability can be exploited to leak sensitive information, such as database credentials.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By using the exposed templating functionality, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This allows for a full compromise of the server and the application.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to specific SEOmatic plugin endpoints, including:
  - `/actions/seomatic/meta-container/meta-link-container`
  - `/actions/seomatic/meta-container/all-meta-containers`
- **`uri` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `uri` parameter in the request URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, as evidenced by the provided exploit URLs.

**Technical Details:**

- The attacker injects Twig template code within the `uri` parameter.
- The application evaluates this injected code, resulting in the vulnerability.
- Examples of payloads used:
    -  `{{4*'4'}}` -  used to confirm basic template injection.
    - `{{craft.app.config.db.password}}` - attempts to disclose the database password.
    - `{{constant('Twig\\Environment::VERSION')}}` - used to get the twig version
    - `{{craft.app.view.evaluateDynamicContent('phpinfo();')}}` - used to execute arbitrary PHP code (phpinfo).
    - `{{craft.app.view.evaluateDynamicContent(%27print(system("uname\x20-a"));%27)}}` - used to execute a system command (uname -a).

**Affected versions:**

- SEOmatic plugin versions prior to 3.3.0 are vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.2.46 and a regression fix is in version 3.3.0, as per the changelog.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content provided includes changelog entries that mention both XSS and SSTI fixes, indicating a history of input validation issues in the plugin's handling of the `uri` parameter.
- The vulnerability can be easily identified by observing the output of the `{{4*'4'}}` payload. If it returns "16", the site is likely vulnerable.
