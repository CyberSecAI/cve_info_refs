Subject: CVE-2020-9493: Apache Chainsaw: Java deserialization in Chainsaw

Reply-to: general@...ging.apache.org

Description:

A deserialization flaw was found in Apache Chainsaw versions prior to
2.1.0 which could lead to malicious code execution.

Mitigation:

Don't configure Chainsaw to read serialized log events.  Use a
different receiver, such as XMLSocketReceiver

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-9493:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a deserialization flaw in Apache Chainsaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Deserialization Flaw:** Chainsaw is vulnerable to Java deserialization issues when handling serialized log events.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this flaw can lead to the execution of arbitrary malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by configuring Chainsaw to receive serialized log events.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send maliciously crafted serialized log events to the Chainsaw application. This might involve compromising a logging server or intercepting network traffic.
- The attacker needs to have a way to send serialized data to Chainsaw.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Apache Chainsaw versions prior to 2.1.0.
- This issue was also present in Log4j 1.2.x when Chainsaw was a component of it.
- The vulnerability was reported by @kingkk.
- The suggested mitigations include upgrading to Apache Log4j 2 and Chainsaw 2.1.0, or avoiding the use of serialized log events, using alternatives such as XMLSocketReceiver.
