The provided content relates to CVE-2020-9349.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the weak authentication of the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) service, which allows access without requiring a password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak authentication of the RTSP service. Specifically, the RTSP service does not require a password for access.
- Unencrypted audio/video traffic.
- The device also has a telnet service that is vulnerable to brute-force attacks with the default credentials (`root:cxlinux`).
- Suspicious behavior of posting data to a random Chinese domain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to live video and audio streams from the camera.
- Potential interception of unencrypted audio/video traffic by network intruders.
- The telnet service can be exploited to gain root access on the device.
- With telnet access, the device can be used to penetrate other devices on the network, download malware, and establish backdoors.
- Device can be used in botnets.
- Data leakage via the suspicious Chinese domain connection.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks targeting the open RTSP service, reachable on ports 554 and 8001.
- Brute-force attacks against the telnet service with the default credentials.
- Network-based attacks by exploiting the weak authentication of the RTSP protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable camera is required.
- No authentication is required to access the RTSP stream (with username "admin" and empty password).
- Basic network knowledge and tools like VLC are required.
- For telnet exploitation, knowledge of the default credentials ("root:cxlinux") is needed or capability to perform brute-force attacks.
