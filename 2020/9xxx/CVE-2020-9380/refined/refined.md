The content is related to CVE-2020-9380.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation in the `includes/ajax-control.php` file of the IPTV Smarters WebTV Player. Specifically, the code does not verify the type or extension of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows uploading arbitrary files without checking the file type or extension.
- Lack of authentication: The upload functionality is accessible to unauthenticated users.
- Remote Code Execution: The ability to upload arbitrary files including executable code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to:
- Full server compromise.
- Data theft and manipulation.
- Further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted POST request to `/includes/ajax-control.php` with a malicious file disguised as a `logoImage`. The uploaded file is placed in a publicly accessible directory (`../images/`) which then can be executed by accessing it directly through HTTP GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires network connectivity to the vulnerable server. They do not need any prior authentication or authorization. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
