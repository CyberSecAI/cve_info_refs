Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-9407:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `IWEBSERVICE_JSONRPC_COOKIE` stores potentially sensitive information encoded in base64.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The cookie contains sensitive information, even though it's encoded in base64. Base64 encoding is not encryption and can be easily reversed to reveal the underlying data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information to an attacker who can access the cookie. This could potentially expose user data, session tokens, or other sensitive application details, which could lead to further attacks such as session hijacking or account compromise, though the direct impact is low.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network interception: A malicious actor could potentially intercept network traffic to obtain the cookie.
- Local access: If an attacker gains access to a user's machine or web browser they could potentially extract the cookie.
- Malicious scripts: A different vulnerability on the target website could be used to access the cookies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to obtain the `IWEBSERVICE_JSONRPC_COOKIE`. This could require network access or local access to the user's system. Low privilege is sufficient, making it easier to exploit if access is achieved.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 3.1 (Low), primarily due to the high attack complexity.
- The fix is to update to version 4.3.5a of Online Weather.
