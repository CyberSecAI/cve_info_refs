*  **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user enters malicious javascript in label fields of the plugin.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would require the ability to modify or create pricing tables using the plugin, potentially requiring admin or editor access depending on the site setup and user roles.
