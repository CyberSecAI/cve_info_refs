- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack exhaustion
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stack exhaustion issue. This occurs when a program attempts to use more stack space than is available.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to application denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** The document does not specify an attack vector, but the vulnerability is likely triggered by a malformed document or crafted input that causes excessive stack usage during processing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious document or input to trigger the stack exhaustion.
