Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-9008:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `Tile` widget (aka profile-tiles) input forms of the Blackboard Learn/CloudPeopleTool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. User-controlled input is not being sanitized, allowing malicious scripts to be stored on the user profile.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a user's profile. This code executes whenever a victim visits the attacker's profile or interacts with the attacker's profile icon in affected areas, allowing malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser session. (CWE-79)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Profile Customization:** An attacker injects the malicious script by inputting it into a `Tile` widget form (specifically the "MAJOR" tile is highlighted as most noticeable) within their own user profile page.
- **User Interaction:** The stored script is executed when a victim views the attacker's profile page or hovers over/clicks on the attacker's user icon in areas like:
    - `https://ui.cloudbb.blackboard.com/profiles/me`
    - `https://example.blackboard.com/webapps/bb-social-learning-bb_bb60/execute/mybb?cmd=display&toolId=CloudCoreGateOnMyBb_____CloudPeopleTool`
    - `https://example.blackboard.com/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected Blackboard system in order to access the profile customization page.
- **Ability to Modify Profile:** The attacker needs to have access and permission to edit their profile settings, specifically the `Tile` widgets.
- **Knowledge of Exploit:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerability exists and how to insert the malicious script tags.

**Affected Versions:**
-  Blackboard Learn/CloudPeopleTool v9.1 Q2 2017 Cumulative Update 5 (Build: 3200.0.5-rel.6+3dd6b56) and potentially earlier versions including the `Tile` widget in the profile editor. Later versions with the same widget may also be affected if the issue has not been addressed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered on February 12th, 2020, and the affected feature was discontinued as of April 15th, 2020.
- The "MAJOR" tile is highlighted as the most effective due to it being the only tile to show when hovering over the profile.
- The attacker's profile icon in various locations (My Learning Network, discussion boards) can trigger the malicious script when interacted with by other users.
