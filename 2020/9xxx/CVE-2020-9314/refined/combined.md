# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# YAA: An Obscure MacOS Compressed File Format

[June 14, 2020](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2020/06/14/yaa-an-obscure-macos-compressed-file-format/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)[macos](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/macos/), [yaa](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/yaa/)

## Summary

MacOS introduced a new compression archive format in High Sierra (v10.13) called “YAA”. Because this format is new, it may not be supported correctly by security tools, thus allowing malware authors a way to bypass existing controls in such tools. It is recommended that vendors add support for this format to their tools. Users should NOT accept or open YAA archives received from unknown sources.

## Details

Early this year we ran across a new file format specific to MacOS: **YAA**. Apparently it was originally released in the fall of 2017 as part of MacOS High Sierra (v10.13) (see [this article from MacKungFu](https://www.mackungfu.org/NewcommandlinetoolsinHighSierra)). [As per this forum post](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/133985), apparently it is used as part of compressing the “Content” section of signed executables for MacOS. According t[o another post](https://twitter.com/superevr/status/912567498251411457), this is an LZFSE tool. This should not be confused with an older tool with the same name called [“Yet Another Assembler”](https://www.thinkage.ca/gcos/expl/yaa/expl.html).

It is supported via a command line utility called “yaa” as well as the Archive Utility in the GUI – but in the GUI you can only uncompress the archive. For details regarding the CLI, run “yaa” or “man yaa” (also [see here)](https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/yaa/).

Our previous research around novel file formats found issues in how Google Chrome ([here](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/02/26/multiple-instances-of-download-protection-bypass-in-googles-chrome/) and [here](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/07/02/another-download-protection-bypass-in-google-chrome-bin-files-in-mac-os/)), and various anti-virus vendors for MacOS handle compressed files ([here](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/02/25/research-compressed-files-auto-detection-on-macos/)). **Specifically, handling a novel compressed archive format is something that existing antivirus software, browsers and other utilities may not be dong well since they are not aware of the format. On the other hand, malware authors can easily package malware inside a compressed archive, which will decompressed by a user via double-clicking the file in Finder.** This results from the fact that the Archive utility supports decompression of a lot more file formats that vendors maybe aware of.

For YAA, we have done some testing back in January against a handful of security tools and found some to be vulnerable. Due to lack of resources, we didn’t pursue a more extensive investigation into additional tools but did report whichever issues were found back to the relevant vendors. Because of lack of resources, we are publishing this post to increase awareness of this issue.

To replicate this issue on a particular tool, do the following:

1. Download the EICAR test file [from here](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950) into a folder.
2. Create a YAA file archive as follows:
   * ```
     yaa -d folder -o archive.yaa
     ```
3. Test the resulting “archive.yaa” with the security tool of your choice.
4. To uncompress the archive, double click on it in Finder.

## Vendor Responses

This section contains responses we received for this issue from specific vendors:

* **Chromium: Safe browsing pings not sent back for YAA files (issue # 1039128)**
  + “*The default behavior has been set to FULL\_PING, so unknown types (such as YAA) should now be sending pings to Safe Browsing.*” (also see [our blog post](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2020/01/12/behavior-change-in-chromes-download-protection-service/))
* **Google/Gmail: YAA archives are not scanned for malware by GMail (issue # 147190746)**
  + *“Not all file formats are supported and this is expected.”*

Most A/V vendors responded either with the fact that once expanded the contents will be scanned, or that this will add this as a feature in the future.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```

# Two vulnerabilities in Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server (CVE-2020-9315 and CVE-2020-9314)

[May 10, 2020](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2020/05/10/two-vulnerabilities-in-oracles-iplanet-web-server-cve-2020-9315-and-cve-2020-9314/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[iplanet](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/iplanet/), [oracle](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/oracle/)

## SUMMARY

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the web administration console of **Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server** which allow for **sensitive data exposure** and **limited injection**. The first issue allows read-only access to any page within the administration console without authentication, resulting in sensitive data exposure. The second issue allows for injection of external images which can be used for phishing and social engineering.

These vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor (Oracle) but the vendor will not be issuing security patches because the affected product is no longer supported. Users are encouraged to implement other controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities such as restricting network access to the administration console from the Internet or switching to a supported platform.

Version 7 has been tested and found to be vulnerable, however, it is unknown whether earlier versions are affected. Latest versions of Oracle Glassfish and Eclipse Glassfish application server (v5) share common code with the affected product, have been tested and do not seem to be vulnerable. **MITRE has assigned CVE-2020-9315 to track the sensitive data exposure issue and CVE-2020-9314 to track the injection issue.**

## ISSUE #1 – SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE / ADMIN GUI BYPASS (CVE-2020-9315)

A vulnerability exists in the web administration console of Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server which makes it possible to read information from any page within the console without authentication. This can result in sensitive data exposure of configuration information about the server including encryption keys, JVM configuration and other data. We did not perform testing to see whether this vulnerability allows for changes to be made within the console.

This is accomplished by replacing any URL for any page within the administration console as follows:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/>**admingui**/\*

with:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/>**version**/\*

To replicate, try the following URLs:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/>
* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/serverTasksGeneral?serverTasksGeneral.GeneralWebserverTabs.TabHref=2>

## ISSUE #2 – IMAGE INJECTION IN THE ADMIN GUI (CVE-2020-9314)

The “**productNameSrc**” parameter in the administration console allows for injection of external images. When used in combination with the “**productNameHeight**” and “**productNameWidth**” parameters, this can be used to inject an external image into a site to facilitate phishing. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0516. The earlier fix added validation against XSS issues but didn’t add validation to make sure an external image is not loaded.

To replicate, try the following URLs:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/Version>?**&productNameSrc=http://www.example.com/test.jpg**&productNameHeight=500&productNameWidth=500
* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/Masthead.jsp>?**productNameSrc=http://www.example.com/test.jpg**&productNameHeight=500&productNameWidth=500

## VENDOR RESPONSE

Both vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor (Oracle), however the vendor doesn’t plan to issue security patches since the product is no longer supported, as per the following responses:

> *Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x is no longer supported. Please see [the life time support document](https://www.oracle.com/us/assets/lifetime-support-middleware-069163.pdf).*

And:

> *Thank you for your report regarding Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x, which is no longer supported by Oracle. Since Oracle no longer supports Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x, the policy is that there is no coordinated disclosure involving Oracle. Reporters who discover security vulnerabilities in products that Oracle no longer supports are free to disclose vulnerability details without Oracle participation. Oracle does not assign CVEs for products that are no longer supported. That means, if you want a CVE assigned you will need to contact Mitre.*

CERT/CC concurred with the vendor’s assessment.

MITRE has assigned **CVE-2020-9315** to track the sensitivity data exposure issue, and **CVE-2020-9314** to track the injection issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS AND MITIGATIONS

Version 7 has been tested and found to be vulnerable, however, it is unknown whether earlier versions are affected. Latest versions of Oracle Glassfish and Eclipse Glassfish application server (v5) share common code with the affected product but have been tested and do not seem to be vulnerable.

Users are encouraged to implement other controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities such as restricting network access to the administration console from the Internet or switching to a supported platform.

# Two vulnerabilities in Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server (CVE-2020-9315 and CVE-2020-9314)

[May 10, 2020](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2020/05/10/two-vulnerabilities-in-oracles-iplanet-web-server-cve-2020-9315-and-cve-2020-9314/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[iplanet](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/iplanet/), [oracle](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/oracle/)

## SUMMARY

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the web administration console of **Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server** which allow for **sensitive data exposure** and **limited injection**. The first issue allows read-only access to any page within the administration console without authentication, resulting in sensitive data exposure. The second issue allows for injection of external images which can be used for phishing and social engineering.

These vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor (Oracle) but the vendor will not be issuing security patches because the affected product is no longer supported. Users are encouraged to implement other controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities such as restricting network access to the administration console from the Internet or switching to a supported platform.

Version 7 has been tested and found to be vulnerable, however, it is unknown whether earlier versions are affected. Latest versions of Oracle Glassfish and Eclipse Glassfish application server (v5) share common code with the affected product, have been tested and do not seem to be vulnerable. **MITRE has assigned CVE-2020-9315 to track the sensitive data exposure issue and CVE-2020-9314 to track the injection issue.**

## ISSUE #1 – SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE / ADMIN GUI BYPASS (CVE-2020-9315)

A vulnerability exists in the web administration console of Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server which makes it possible to read information from any page within the console without authentication. This can result in sensitive data exposure of configuration information about the server including encryption keys, JVM configuration and other data. We did not perform testing to see whether this vulnerability allows for changes to be made within the console.

This is accomplished by replacing any URL for any page within the administration console as follows:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/>**admingui**/\*

with:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/>**version**/\*

To replicate, try the following URLs:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/>
* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/serverTasksGeneral?serverTasksGeneral.GeneralWebserverTabs.TabHref=2>

## ISSUE #2 – IMAGE INJECTION IN THE ADMIN GUI (CVE-2020-9314)

The “**productNameSrc**” parameter in the administration console allows for injection of external images. When used in combination with the “**productNameHeight**” and “**productNameWidth**” parameters, this can be used to inject an external image into a site to facilitate phishing. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0516. The earlier fix added validation against XSS issues but didn’t add validation to make sure an external image is not loaded.

To replicate, try the following URLs:

* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/Version>?**&productNameSrc=http://www.example.com/test.jpg**&productNameHeight=500&productNameWidth=500
* <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/Masthead.jsp>?**productNameSrc=http://www.example.com/test.jpg**&productNameHeight=500&productNameWidth=500

## VENDOR RESPONSE

Both vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor (Oracle), however the vendor doesn’t plan to issue security patches since the product is no longer supported, as per the following responses:

> *Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x is no longer supported. Please see [the life time support document](https://www.oracle.com/us/assets/lifetime-support-middleware-069163.pdf).*

And:

> *Thank you for your report regarding Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x, which is no longer supported by Oracle. Since Oracle no longer supports Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x, the policy is that there is no coordinated disclosure involving Oracle. Reporters who discover security vulnerabilities in products that Oracle no longer supports are free to disclose vulnerability details without Oracle participation. Oracle does not assign CVEs for products that are no longer supported. That means, if you want a CVE assigned you will need to contact Mitre.*

CERT/CC concurred with the vendor’s assessment.

MITRE has assigned **CVE-2020-9315** to track the sensitivity data exposure issue, and **CVE-2020-9314** to track the injection issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS AND MITIGATIONS

Version 7 has been tested and found to be vulnerable, however, it is unknown whether earlier versions are affected. Latest versions of Oracle Glassfish and Eclipse Glassfish application server (v5) share common code with the affected product but have been tested and do not seem to be vulnerable.

Users are encouraged to implement other controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities such as restricting network access to the administration console from the Internet or switching to a supported platform.

CVE-2020-9315 and CVE-2020-9314 in iPlanet version 7 will not receive patches.

A pair of vulnerabilities in Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server have been disclosed that can lead to sensitive data exposure and image injections onto web pages if exploited. However, no patch is forthcoming for either flaw.

The bugs (CVE-2020-9315 and CVE-2020-9314) are specifically found in the web administration console of [iPlanet version 7](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/webtier/featuresandbenefits-1-134420.pdf), which has reached end-of-life and is no longer supported – hence no patches.

The first issue allows read-only access to any page within the administration console without authentication.

[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/02/19151457/subscribe2.jpg)](https://threatpost.com/newsletter-sign/)

“This can result in sensitive data exposure of configuration information about the server, including encryption keys, Java Virtual machine (JVM) configuration and other data,” researchers at Nightwatch Security said [in a posting](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2020/05/10/two-vulnerabilities-in-oracles-iplanet-web-server-cve-2020-9315-and-cve-2020-9314/) on Sunday about the issue. “We did not perform testing to see whether this vulnerability allows for changes to be made within the console.”

Attackers can replace any URL for any page within the administration console, they added.

The second issue arises from the “productNameSrc” parameter in the administration console.

“When used in combination with the ‘productNameHeight’ and “productNameWidth” parameters, this can be used to inject an external image into a site to facilitate phishing,” according to the researchers. “This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0516. The earlier fix added validation against XSS issues but didn’t add validation to make sure an external image is not loaded.”

Oracle pointed the researchers to its EOL statement when the bug report was submitted.

“Thank you for your report regarding Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x, which is no longer supported by Oracle,” said the vendor. “Since Oracle no longer supports Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x, the policy is that there is no coordinated disclosure involving Oracle. Reporters who discover security vulnerabilities in products that Oracle no longer supports are free to disclose vulnerability details without Oracle participation.”

Even though there’s no patch, all is not lost: Users can implement other controls to mitigate the problem and reduce risk, according to Nightwatch – such as restricting network access to the administration console from the internet.

Version 7 if iPlanet is vulnerable, but Nightwatch didn’t test earlier versions.

Oracle’s regular [Patch Tuesday updates](https://threatpost.com/oracle-tackles-405-bugs-for-april-quarterly-patch-update/154737/) are expected tomorrow.

<https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2020/05/10/two-vulnerabilities-in-oracles-iplanet-web-server-cve-2020-9315-and-cve-2020-9314/>)

SUMMARY

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the web administration console
of Oracle’s iPlanet Web Server which allow for sensitive data exposure
and limited injection. The first issue allows read-only access to any
page within the administration console without authentication,
resulting in sensitive data exposure. The second issue allows for
injection of external images which can be used for phishing and social
engineering.

These vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor (Oracle) but
the vendor will not be issuing security patches because the affected
product is no longer supported. Users are encouraged to implement
other controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities such as restricting
network access to the administration console from the Internet or
switching to a supported platform.

Version 7 has been tested and found to be vulnerable, however, it is
unknown whether earlier versions are affected. Latest versions of
Oracle Glassfish and Eclipse Glassfish application server (v5) share
common code with the affected product, have been tested and do not
seem to be vulnerable. MITRE has assigned CVE-2020-9315 to track the
sensitive data exposure issue and CVE-2020-9314 to track the injection
issue.

ISSUE #1 – SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE / ADMIN GUI BYPASS (CVE-2020-9315)

A vulnerability exists in the web administration console of Oracle’s
iPlanet Web Server which makes it possible to read information from
any page within the console without authentication. This can result in
sensitive data exposure of configuration information about the server
including encryption keys, JVM configuration and other data. We did
not perform testing to see whether this vulnerability allows for
changes to be made within the console.

This is accomplished by replacing any URL for any page within the
administration console as follows:
- [http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/admingui/*](http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/admingui/%2A)
with:
- [http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/*](http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/%2A)

To replicate, try the following URLs:
- <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/>
- <http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/serverTasksGeneral?serverTasksGeneral.GeneralWebserverTabs.TabHref=2>

ISSUE #2 – IMAGE INJECTION IN THE ADMIN GUI (CVE-2020-9314)

The “productNameSrc” parameter in the administration console allows
for injection of external images. When used in combination with the
“productNameHeight” and “productNameWidth” parameters, this can be
used to inject an external image into a site to facilitate phishing.
This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0516. The earlier fix
added validation against XSS issues but didn’t add validation to make
sure an external image is not loaded.

To replicate, try the following URLs:
-
<http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/Version?&productNameSrc=http://www.example.com/test.jpg&productNameHeight=500&productNameWidth=500>
-
<http://%5Btarget%5D/admingui/version/Masthead.jsp?productNameSrc=http://www.example.com/test.jpg&productNameHeight=500&productNameWidth=500>

VENDOR RESPONSE

Both vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor (Oracle),
however the vendor doesn’t plan to issue security patches since the
product is no longer supported, as per the following responses:

"Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x is no longer supported. Please see
the life time support document."

And:

"Thank you for your report regarding Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x,
which is no longer supported by Oracle. Since Oracle no longer
supports Oracle iPlanet Web Server 7.0.x, the policy is that there is
no coordinated disclosure involving Oracle. Reporters who discover
security vulnerabilities in products that Oracle no longer supports
are free to disclose vulnerability details without Oracle
participation. Oracle does not assign CVEs for products that are no
longer supported. That means, if you want a CVE assigned you will need
to contact Mitre."

CERT/CC concurred with the vendor’s assessment.

MITRE has assigned CVE-2020-9315 to track the sensitivity data
exposure issue, and CVE-2020-9314 to track the injection issue.

AFFECTED VERSIONS AND MITIGATIONS

Version 7 has been tested and found to be vulnerable, however, it is
unknown whether earlier versions are affected. Latest versions of
Oracle Glassfish and Eclipse Glassfish application server (v5) share
common code with the affected product but have been tested and do not
seem to be vulnerable.

Users are encouraged to implement other controls to mitigate these
vulnerabilities such as restricting network access to the
administration console from the Internet or switching to a supported
platform.
