```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- The "productNameSrc" parameter in the iPlanet Web Server administration console allows for injection of external images. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0516, where validation against XSS was added, but validation to prevent loading of external images was not.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
-  Insecure handling of user-supplied input in the "productNameSrc" parameter.
-  Incomplete fix for a previous XSS vulnerability (CVE-2012-0516).
-  Lack of input validation to prevent loading of external images.

Impact of exploitation:
-  Injection of external images into the web administration console.
-  Phishing and social engineering attacks facilitated by injected images.

Attack vectors:
-  Malicious crafted URL using the vulnerable "productNameSrc", "productNameHeight", and "productNameWidth" parameters.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
-  Attacker needs network access to the iPlanet Web Server administration console.
-  Attacker must be able to craft a URL with malicious parameters.
