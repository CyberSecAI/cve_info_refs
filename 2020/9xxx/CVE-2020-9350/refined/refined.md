Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of an authenticated user to store a malicious JavaScript payload within a graph template. This template is stored as an XML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input (the JavaScript within the graph template), allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript when accessed directly.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Encoding:** The application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied data, specifically when handling graph templates, allowing the injection of malicious script.
- **Direct Access to XML Resources:** The vulnerability is triggered by the direct access of the stored XML resource containing the malicious script bypassing the security of SAS Visual Analytics parsing of the graph.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** When a user accesses the graph template (XML file) directly, the malicious JavaScript is executed within their browser.
- **Potential for Various Malicious Activities:** An attacker could potentially perform a variety of malicious actions, including stealing cookies, redirecting users, performing actions on behalf of the user, and more depending on the scope and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Graph Template:** An authenticated user crafts a graph template containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Direct Access to XML Resource:** A user directly accesses the stored XML resource outside the context of SAS Visual Analytics (which parses it safely), thus triggering the execution of the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the SAS system to create the malicious graph template.
- **Knowledge of XML Resource Location:** The attacker must have knowledge or be able to discover the location where the stored XML resource is accessible to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as low severity since it requires the user to access the XML resource directly, outside of Visual Analytics. This likely implies that access control measures are in place that prevent unauthorized users from accessing the XML directly but that a user with permission to do so may be vulnerable if the user is not expecting malicious script within the file.
- Hotfixes are available for SAS Viya 3.4 and 3.5 on both Windows and Linux.
