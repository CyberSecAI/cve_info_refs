Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-9404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper verification when changing user role settings in PACTware. Specifically, passwords associated with user roles can be modified without requiring the current password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unverified Password Change (CWE-620):** The core issue is that PACTware allows modifications to user role passwords without requiring authentication or the existing password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access:** A local attacker can modify user role settings without any form of authentication.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can escalate their privileges by modifying role permissions and passwords.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can enable user roles and set new passwords, locking out legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine where PACTware is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker with local user privileges on the system running PACTware is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary of CVE-2020-9404:**

PACTware versions prior to 5.0.5.31 and 4.1 SP6 are vulnerable to an unverified password change vulnerability. A local attacker can modify user role configurations, including passwords, without providing the existing password, leading to potential privilege escalation and denial-of-service conditions.
