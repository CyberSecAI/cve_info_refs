- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A module within Huawei FusionCompute lacks strict access control and information protection mechanisms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control and information protection leading to potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with low privileges can obtain additional information, leading to information leakage.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires an attacker with low-level access to the affected Huawei FusionCompute product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low-privilege access to the FusionCompute environment.
