**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that malicious script is stored on the server and then executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the affected resource.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser of the victim. This can result in a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website or redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks that might lead to the compromise of sensitive user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into an area of the application that persists the data. When another user views that data, the injected script executes within their browser. This is categorized as a stored XSS attack, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable field. This could be accomplished through various input points in the AEM Forms add-on package. The attacker might be an authenticated user with access to specific functionalities or through other exploitable vulnerabilities that permit storing the malicious code. The malicious code is stored in the system, and will be executed when other users interact with that data.
