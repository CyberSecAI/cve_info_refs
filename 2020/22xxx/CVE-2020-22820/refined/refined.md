The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in MKCMS V6.2. Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. SQL Injection in /ucenter/repass.php**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses `stripslashes()` on the `name` parameter from a POST request before using it in a SQL query. This bypasses the `addslashes()` function applied earlier in the code.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/ucenter/repass.php` with a malicious `name` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
*   **Details:** The `name` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**2. SQL Injection in /ucenter/active.php**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses `stripslashes()` on the `verify` parameter from a GET request before using it in a SQL query. This bypasses the `addslashes()` function applied earlier in the code.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET request to `/ucenter/active.php` with a malicious `verify` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests.
*   **Details:** The `verify` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**3. SQL Injection in /ucenter/reg.php**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to the other two, the application uses `stripslashes()` on the `name` parameter from a POST request before using it in a SQL query. This bypasses the `addslashes()` function applied earlier in the code.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/ucenter/reg.php` with a malicious `name` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
*   **Details:** The `name` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**General Analysis:**

*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the inconsistent use of `addslashes()` and `stripslashes()`. While `addslashes()` is used for escaping input, `stripslashes()` is used before the data is used in SQL queries, effectively undoing the escaping and leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain control of the server by executing arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Mitigation:** The blog post suggests removing the `stripslashes()` calls before using POST/GET parameters in SQL queries.
