- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering page titles, meta descriptions, and meta keywords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who view the affected pages. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious script into the page title, meta description, or meta keywords fields through the web interface. The XSS payload is then stored in the database. When the page is rendered, the malicious script is executed in the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the page title, meta description, or meta keywords. This would typically require having administrator or editor level access to the CMS.
