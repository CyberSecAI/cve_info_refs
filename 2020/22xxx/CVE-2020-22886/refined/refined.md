The provided content is related to CVE-2020-22886.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by excessive recursion during garbage collection when handling deeply chained bound functions. The `jsG_markproperty` function, which is part of the garbage collection process, is called recursively for each bound function in the chain leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack overflow:** The core vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by deep recursion in the garbage collector when marking properties of objects with long chains of bound functions. The garbage collector does not limit the recursion depth, allowing an attacker to exhaust the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** Exploiting the stack overflow leads to program termination due to the ASan signal.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted JavaScript code:** The attacker provides malicious JavaScript code that creates a long chain of bound functions, which triggers the stack overflow during garbage collection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the vulnerable environment (mujs in this case).
