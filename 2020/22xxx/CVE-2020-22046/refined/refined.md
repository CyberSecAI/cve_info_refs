Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22046:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `avpriv_float_dsp_alloc` function within `libavutil/float_dsp.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak. Specifically, memory allocated by `avpriv_float_dsp_alloc` is not freed, leading to memory exhaustion over time if the vulnerable code path is repeatedly triggered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS). Repeatedly triggering the memory leak will exhaust the available memory, causing the application to become unstable, crash, or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted input file that triggers the vulnerable code path within `avpriv_float_dsp_alloc`.
- The provided PoC file (`PoC_avpriv.wav`) demonstrates how this memory leak can be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input file to FFmpeg that it will process. No special privileges or specific network position is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified through valgrind and ASAN logs, which showed memory leaks when processing a specific .wav file. The fix is not detailed in this ticket, but the issue was marked as `fixed`.
- The `ffmpeg` command used for reproduction is: `ffmpeg_g -y -i $PoC -loglevel 0 -psnr tmp.eac3`. This command attempts to transcode a file to eac3 format.
- The vulnerability is confirmed by the Debian security advisory DLA-2818-1, which lists `CVE-2020-22046` as a memory leak in `avpriv_float_dsp_alloc`.
