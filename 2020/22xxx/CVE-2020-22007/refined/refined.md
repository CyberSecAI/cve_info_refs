{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect Access Control",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS Command Injection vulnerability allows physical attackers to interrupt the boot sequence and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges via the UART hardware interface.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution with root privileges, information disclosure, backdoor planting for further attacks such as data infiltration and exfiltration on the internal network.",
    "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the device is required to access the device console via the UART hardware (Tx, Rx, GND) interface. Once connected, an attacker can interrupt the boot sequence and gain root console access.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Physical access to the device, ability to identify and connect to the device's UART interface (Tx, Rx, GND)."
