Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22022:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `filter_frame` function within `libavfilter/vf_fieldorder.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption, which could lead to other potential consequences, such as arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a crafted media file using FFmpeg that triggers the vulnerable code path in the `fieldorder` filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted media file that is processed by FFmpeg, specifically leveraging the `fieldorder` filter.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) during the development/testing phase, which pinpoints the specific location of memory corruption
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) file `PoC_vf_fieldorder.png32` was provided, which triggers the vulnerability.
- The issue was fixed in the `git-master` branch shortly after the report.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Debian security updates DSA-4990-1 and DLA-2742-1.
