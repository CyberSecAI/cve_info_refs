The provided content describes two stored XSS vulnerabilities in FME Server versions 2019.2 and 2020.0 Beta.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses JSON to display information, however, the logs render information as HTML without proper output encoding. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Stored XSS: Malicious code injected via the username field during login is stored and executed when an administrator views the logs.
- Authenticated Stored XSS: The same vulnerability exists in other fields like the "Name" field when creating, deleting or modifying users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser when viewing the logs or user management pages. This could lead to session hijacking, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The unauthenticated XSS vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the login endpoint with a malicious username.
- The authenticated XSS vulnerability can be triggered through user management pages

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the unauthenticated XSS, an attacker needs to send a POST request to the login page.
- For the authenticated XSS, an attacker needs to have an authenticated session for user management pages.
