The provided content describes two stored XSS vulnerabilities in FME Server versions 2019.2 and 2020.0 Beta:

**Vulnerability 1: Unauthenticated Stored XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** The username field in the login portal does not sanitize user input and allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored and executed when an administrator views the logs.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization/output encoding in the username field and the logs display mechanism.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the browser of an administrator when viewing the logs. This allows for potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with a malicious username payload to the login endpoint.
*   **Required Capabilities:** No authentication is needed to inject the malicious payload. An administrator needs to view the logs for the XSS to be triggered.

**Vulnerability 2: Authenticated Stored XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to the unauthenticated XSS, the "Name" field when creating, deleting, or modifying users also lacks input sanitization and allows for stored XSS.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization/output encoding in the user management functionality.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the browser of an administrator when viewing user information or related logs. This allows for potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting the malicious payload through the "Name" field when creating/modifying users via the web interface.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker requires valid authentication to access user management functionality to inject the malicious payload. An administrator needs to view user information or logs for the XSS to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**

*   The application uses JSON to display information, seemingly as a measure to prevent XSS, however, in the logs, the information was rendered as HTML without encoding, leading to the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor and subsequently fixed in later versions.
