Breaks on large databases since no index is used with BINARY:

SELECT \* FROM `store` WHERE `key` = 'MYSQL\_MIGRATION\_LEVEL' 0.0015 seconds

SELECT \* FROM `store` WHERE BINARY `key` = 'MYSQL\_MIGRATION\_LEVEL' timeout

possible

SELECT \* FROM `store` WHERE `key` = 'MYSQL\_MIGRATION\_LEVEL' AND BINARY `key` = 'MYSQL\_MIGRATION\_LEVEL' 0.0019 seconds

Sorry, something went wrong.

I was only searching where and why BINARY was put in.

Seems fiexed in ueberdb but etherpad 1.8.3 still uses ueberdb 0.4.5 which has BINARY with no AND:

this.db.query("SELECT `value` FROM `store` WHERE BINARY `key` = ?", [key], function(err,results)

Yes I know, and that's waiting on a patch fix being merged by [@muxator](https://github.com/muxator) - See etherpad open pull requests.

FWIW see <https://travis-ci.org/github/ether/ueberDB> bottom of the page. I have a new branch where I'm collecting data so this doesn't happen again.
