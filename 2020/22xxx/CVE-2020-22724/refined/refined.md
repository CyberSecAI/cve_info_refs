Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the `content.server` parameter within the `add_server_service` function in `/usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/admin/pptp_server.lua`. This parameter is directly incorporated into a shell command without sufficient validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Since the `content.server` string is directly included in a `string.format` call used to construct a shell command, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by manipulating the `server` value in the HTTP request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious shell commands, an attacker can achieve remote code execution with root privileges on the router. The provided examples demonstrate the execution of `id` command, showcasing the attacker's ability to execute any command on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by intercepting and modifying the HTTP request used to add a new PPTP server, specifically the 'data' parameter which is passed to `add_server_service` function.
* **Direct Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is directly exposed through the web interface, specifically when adding a PPTP server. By crafting a malicious request with a crafted `server` parameter in the JSON payload, an attacker can inject commands into the shell.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface, typically from a local network.
* **Web Interface Access:** The attacker must be able to access the web interface and send POST requests with a malicious payload.
* **Knowledge of API Call:**  Knowledge of the specific API call and the parameter structure related to adding the PPTP server is required.

**Additional Details (from the content):**
* The vulnerability exists in the `add_server_service` function within `pptp_server.lua`.
* The `check_option_legality` function does not perform any validation on the `server` parameter
* The vulnerable code directly uses `sys.fork_exec` with a shell command containing unsanitized user input
* The attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands via the `server` parameter.
* The attacker achieves root privileges on the router.
