Package        : modsecurity-crs
Version        : 3.2.3-0+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16384 CVE-2020-22669 CVE-2021-35368 CVE-2022-39955
                 CVE-2022-39956 CVE-2022-39957 CVE-2022-39958
Debian Bug     : 924352 992000 1021137

Multiple issues were found in modsecurity-crs, a set of generic attack
detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application
firewalls, which allows remote attackers to bypass the web applications
firewall.

If you are using modsecurity-crs with apache2 / libapache2-modsecurity, please
make sure to review your modsecurity configuration, usually
/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf, against the updated recommended
configration, available in /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended:
Some of the changes to the recommended rules are required to avoid WAF bypasses
in certain circumstances.

Please note that CVE-2022-39956 requires an updated modsecurity-apache packge,
which has been previously uploaded to buster-security, see Debian LTS Advisory
DLA-3283-1 for details.

If you are using some other solution in connection with the
modsecurity-ruleset, for example one that it is using libmodsecurity3, your
solution might error out with an error message like "Error creating rule:
Unknown variable: MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS". In this case you can disable the
mitigation for CVE-2022-29956 by removing the rule file
REQUEST-922-MULTIPART-ATTACK.conf.  However, be aware that this will disable
the protection and could allow attackers to bypass your Web Application
Firewall.

There is no package in Debian which depends on libmodsecurity3, so if you are
only using software which is available from Debian, you are not affected by
this limitation.

Kudos to @airween for the support and help while perparing the update.

CVE-2018-16384

    A SQL injection bypass (aka PL1 bypass) exists in OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule
    Set (owasp-modsecurity-crs) through v3.1.0-rc3 via {`a`b} where a is a special
    function name (such as "if") and b is the SQL statement to be executed.

CVE-2020-22669

    Modsecurity owasp-modsecurity-crs 3.2.0 (Paranoia level at PL1) has a SQL
    injection bypass vulnerability. Attackers can use the comment characters and
    variable assignments in the SQL syntax to bypass Modsecurity WAF protection and
    implement SQL injection attacks on Web applications.

CVE-2022-39955

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set
    bypass by submitting a specially crafted HTTP Content-Type header field that
    indicates multiple character encoding schemes. A vulnerable back-end can
    potentially be exploited by declaring multiple Content-Type "charset" names and
    therefore bypassing the configurable CRS Content-Type header "charset" allow
    list. An encoded payload can bypass CRS detection this way and may then be
    decoded by the backend. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected,
    as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and
    users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.

CVE-2022-39956

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set
    bypass for HTTP multipart requests by submitting a payload that uses a
    character encoding scheme via the Content-Type or the deprecated
    Content-Transfer-Encoding multipart MIME header fields that will not be decoded
    and inspected by the web application firewall engine and the rule set. The
    multipart payload will therefore bypass detection. A vulnerable backend that
    supports these encoding schemes can potentially be exploited. The legacy CRS
    versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported
    versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised upgrade to 3.2.2
    and 3.3.3 respectively. The mitigation against these vulnerabilities depends on
    the installation of the latest ModSecurity version (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).

CVE-2022-39957

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body
    bypass. A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing an optional
    "charset" parameter in order to receive the response in an encoded form.
    Depending on the "charset", this response can not be decoded by the web
    application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily
    be detected, may therefore bypass detection. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and
    3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and
    3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3
    respectively.

CVE-2022-39958

    The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body bypass
    to sequentially exfiltrate small and undetectable sections of data by
    repeatedly submitting an HTTP Range header field with a small byte range. A
    restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may be
    exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a web application
    firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restricted resource may bypass
    pattern matching techniques and allow undetected access. The legacy CRS
    versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported
    versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2
    and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS paranoia level of 3 or higher.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.3-0+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your modsecurity-crs packages.

For the detailed security status of modsecurity-crs please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/modsecurity-crs>

## Description

![@seedis](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39592354?v=4&size=48)[seedis](https://github.com/seedis)opened [on Mar 28, 2020](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/1727#issue-589601789)
### Description

Fuzz found that the following request can bypass modesecurity rules and implement SQLi injection.

sample code：`user.php`(id parameter has SQL injection security issues)

```
<?php
echo "<head><title>SQL injection demo</title></head>";
$id=$_GET['id'];
$conn=new mysqli('127.0.0.1','root','root','test');
if(!$conn){
	die("Error to connect database!");
	}
	$sql="select username from user where id={$id}";
#	echo "$sql"."</br></br>";
	$res=$conn->query($sql);
	if($res){
	    $row=$res->fetch_row();
		    echo "\t Hello <b>".htmlspecialchars($row[0])." </b>,having a good day!";
			$res->free();
			$conn->close();
		}
	else{
			echo "<b>error</b>";
		}
?>

```

3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The request is as follows：

```

```
http://127.0.0.1/user.php?id=1

evil request:

id=1 and 1=1 (blocked by CRS)

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39592354/78272800-8ea8b800-7540-11ea-8e61-6fb452527a27.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39592354/78272800-8ea8b800-7540-11ea-8e61-6fb452527a27.png)

request(bypass CRS3.2.0) for SQL injection:

```
http://127.0.0.1/user.php?id=@.:=right(right((select authentication_string from mysql.user limit 0,1),1111),1111) union%23%0adistinctrow%0bselect@.

```

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39592354/77826882-46a72100-714d-11ea-8ac4-44ac9a800784.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39592354/77826882-46a72100-714d-11ea-8ac4-44ac9a800784.png)

It can be seen that the user password in the user table in the mysql database is successfully obtained through this bypass method.

### Environment

* CRS version (e.g., v3.2.0): v3.2.0
* Paranoia level setting: PL1
* ModSecurity version (e.g., 2.9.3): 2.9.3/3.0.4
* Web Server and version (e.g, apache 2.4.41): apache2.4.18/nginx1.16.1
* Operating System and version: Ubuntu18.04
* Mysql Version: 5.7.29

Looking forward to fixing it as soon as possible beacause it threatens the security of the database content.

Referring to [#1727](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/1727) this new rule tries to block SQLi payload that uses MySQL set variable syntax at PL1.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Looked a bit into this rule and ran it on some trafic: it doesn't trigger too much but still raise a few false positives on passwords. We're also seeing a few false positives on semi-formatted data from the POST body but overall, it looks fine on our end. I feel the rule could be more specific (doesn't catch all `set bla = 0` syntaxes, ignore the `set` part) but it tackle the original report and isn't harmful on the way. |

| still raise a few false positives on passwords  Sorry, I can't understand this statement. Can you attach an example? A password should be a free input text and if a user chooses a password like `exec(/bin/bash);'+OR+1=1--` it may trigger the whole rule-set...  We're also seeing a few false positives on semi-formatted data from the POST body  Please, if you can share them it would be really helpful to improve this rule.  doesn't catch all set bla = 0 syntaxes, ignore the set part  Yes, because (IMO) `set bla = 0` isn't something we would like to block at PL1. As you can see on [#1727](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/1727) is easy to bypass libinjection and our PL1 by using both `@var:=<sql>` and `{`label`<sql>}` syntaxes. Based on my tests, this is not true by using `set variable = <sql>` syntax. If you can provide a different example of exploiting 1727 PoC by using this syntax it would be really helpful. |

| We run it a bit further and it actually started to trigger on scans :D Appear to overlap slightly with 942190, but it may be because it was a complex payload.  Sorry, I can't understand this statement. Can you attach an example?  The actual exemples are redacted, but not too hard to imagine: you just need to following expression somewhere in the password: `@[\w\d]+\=\S`. For exemple, `@4=d` which could quite likely appear in a randomly generated password. The password you suggested is deliberately malicious, the exemple we're having here is similar to `sh` somewhere in a randomly generated string triggering an SHI rule. I agree that free text is a challenge but we can't completely ignore it: contextualizing the rules enable fewer edge cases and wider usage. For some rules, it's highly complex, for this one it doesn't feel so.  Please, if you can share them it would be really helpful to improve this rule  I'm seeing payloads like this, although not sure where they come from: `redacted@blablav=website.com`  Based on my tests, this is not true by using set variable = syntax  Thanks a lot for the rationale, that makes a ton of sense! Could you add it in the rule's header to explain where this design came from? Will likely be useful in the future! |

| The password you suggested is deliberately malicious  Yes but this is not only related to this rule. It is true for **all** CRS libinjection rules or XSS rules when a random string or base64 encoded string is provided. For example `random/onrandom==` triggers 941100 and 941120 at PL1. Those two rules should have the same behavior for you. |

| I agree, but when possible we should try to minimize it. `941120` is a good exemple of a rule that we deemed too sensitive and since disabled by default to our users.  My point isn't to be completely resilient from false positives in free text (I agree it'll be tricky) but to contextualize patterns a bit when there are low hanging fruits.  Is your point that we should keep the patterns as broad as possible, or that what I'm identifying as a low hanging fruit (looking for a `set` prefix) actually isn't? |

| I'm a bit late to the show, but here is the summary of the discussion about this PR during the [project chat in July 2020](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/1836#issuecomment-668031921).  "We want better documentation, better / more tests and the rule stays in PL2 kindergarden until it is proven to have only very few FPs. It can still be in PL1 for 3.4, but per default it goes to PL2." |
