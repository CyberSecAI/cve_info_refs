Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22025:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `gaussian_blur` function within the `libavfilter/vf_edgedetect.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. This means that memory allocated on the heap is being written beyond its boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption, which can lead to various consequences such as:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) due to program crashes or unexpected behavior.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical data or function pointers.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing specially crafted media files that trigger the vulnerable code path in `gaussian_blur` function when the `edgedetect` filter is used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious media file that, when processed by FFmpeg using the `edgedetect` filter, triggers the buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located at line 153 of `libavfilter/vf_edgedetect.c`.
- The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) log shows the exact location of the memory corruption and the call stack leading to the vulnerability.
- The `config_props` function in `libavfilter/vf_edgedetect.c` at line 137 allocates memory using `av_malloc` which is then used in `gaussian_blur`, where the overflow occurs.
- The fix was marked as "fixed" by "Elon Musk" in the trac ticket, indicating a patch was committed to the source code to address the vulnerability.
