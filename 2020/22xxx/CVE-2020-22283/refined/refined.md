Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22283:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `lwip` library, specifically within the `icmp6_send_response_with_addrs_and_netif` function. The function uses `pbuf_take_at` to copy data from the original packet. However, it passes `p->tot_len` as the length argument to `pbuf_take_at`, where `p->tot_len` represents the total length of the packet including all chained pbufs, instead of just the current pbuf's length (`p->len`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect length calculation:** The code uses the total packet length (`p->tot_len`) instead of the current buffer length (`p->len`) when copying data with `pbuf_take_at`. This leads to reading beyond the bounds of the current pbuf.
- **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability leads to a buffer overflow when copying data, specifically in the `pbuf_take_at` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Disclosure:** An attacker can cause the system to disclose potentially sensitive memory contents from beyond the intended buffer boundaries. This could leak information to remote attackers through the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted ICMPv6 packet:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted ICMPv6 packet to a vulnerable system. The crafted packet will cause `icmp6_send_response_with_addrs_and_netif` to copy more data than available in current pbuf using `pbuf_take_at`, causing memory disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets (specifically crafted ICMPv6 packets) to the vulnerable device.
- **Ability to craft packets:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious ICMPv6 packet to trigger the vulnerability in the `lwip` stack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported and fixed in the `lwip` git master branch with commit ID `488d4ad2460c3b41bef69724cad89c28a905eda9` and `489405839ae0fea8b99c4896f632eb688dc8a19a`
- The fix involved ensuring the correct length (`p->len`) is used when calling `pbuf_take_at`.
