- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SOGo webmail application does not properly sanitize user-provided data within HTML email messages, specifically related to the `onpointerrawupdate` event handler.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize or remove the `onpointerrawupdate` attribute within an `img` tag included in the email content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an email which, when viewed by a victim, executes within the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking (accessing cookies) and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted email containing a malicious SVG image with the `onpointerrawupdate` event handler to a victim's SOGo Web Mail inbox.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user of the vulnerable SOGo webmail instance.
