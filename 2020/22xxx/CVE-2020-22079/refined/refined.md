Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22079:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the `httpd` binary of Tenda routers. Specifically, the `timeZone` parameter from the `POST /goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` request is not validated, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. The `sscanf` function at line 142 of the vulnerable code copies the unchecked input from the `timeZone` parameter into a fixed-size buffer `v9`. Supplying a long string for this parameter overwrites the buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The code does not properly validate the length of the `timeZone` parameter before using `sscanf`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow leads to a program crash causing a denial of service for the router. The analysis explains how the overflow corrupts the return address, leading to a crash when the program attempts to execute from an invalid address.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is a neighboring network. The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to construct an HTTP POST request with a maliciously long `timeZone` parameter.
* **Authentication:** The provided PoC includes a `Cookie: password=uhotgb`, which suggests that the attacker may need to be authenticated.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable function is within the `bin/httpd` binary, specifically related to wifi settings in the system management.
* The `sscanf` function is called on the attacker-controlled input `timeZone`.
* Dynamic analysis shows how the overflow occurs. Before sscanf, the register `[R11,#var_2C]` holds normal values. After the execution of sscanf, it is overwritten with the attacker-controlled payload (ASCII 'A' in the example).
* The program crashes due to the overflow overwriting the return address and then an invalid memory access using `LDRB` instruction.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   **Vendor:** Tenda
*   **Product:** AC9 and potentially other models.
*   **Affected Versions:** V1.0V15.03.05.19（6318）, V3.0V15.03.06.42\_multi, and possibly others.

**Additional Information**
* The content references a CNVD ID (CNVD-2021-17400) which confirms that the vulnerability has been officially registered in the China National Vulnerability Database.
