# CVE-2020-22079

## 1、Basci information

vendor: Tenda

product: AC9 and so on

version: V1.0V15.03.05.19（6318）、V3.0V15.03.06.42\_multi and so on

Vulnerability type: buffer overflow

Vulnerability Effect: Denial of Service

## 2、Principle description of vulnerability technology

Affected Vulnerability Components:

* File name: bin/httpd
* function: system management ->wifi settings

## 3、Vulnerability value

Stable reproducibility: Yes

exploit conditions：

* attack vector type: neighboring network
* Stability of exploit: every attack can be successful
* Whether the product is configured by default: there are loopholes in the functional components that are enabled at the factory

## 4、PoC

```

## 5、Vulnerability principle

### 5.1 static analysis

As shown in the following figure, because the passed-in `timeZone` parameter is not checked, the 142-line `sscanf` assigns the maliciously injected super-long data to the `v9` variable, which causes the buffer overflow in the later operation of the program, and finally causes the effect of denial of service

[![](/Lyc-heng/routers/raw/main/routers/imgs/stack1/code.png)](/Lyc-heng/routers/blob/main/routers/imgs/stack1/code.png)

### 5.2 dynamic analysis

Use IDA for dynamic debugging, which is the original assembly code corresponding to the program. Before the execution of `sscanf`, the value at `[R11,#var_2C]` is still normal

[![](/Lyc-heng/routers/raw/main/routers/imgs/stakc1/debug.PNG)](/Lyc-heng/routers/blob/main/routers/imgs/stakc1/debug.PNG)

When `sscanf` is executed, the value at `[R11,#var_2C]` becomes a maliciously injected value (ASCII code value of A)

[![](/Lyc-heng/routers/raw/main/routers/imgs/stack1/debug1.PNG)](/Lyc-heng/routers/blob/main/routers/imgs/stack1/debug1.PNG)

Looking back at the disassembly code given by IDA, the PoC given above makes the return value of `sscanf` of 142 lines 2, which causes the program to crash at 145

[![](/Lyc-heng/routers/raw/main/routers/imgs/stack1/code.PNG)](/Lyc-heng/routers/blob/main/routers/imgs/stack1/code.PNG)

The reason for the crash is that `[R11,#var_2C]` is directly assigned to R3 register at address `0x00067360`, and the subsequent LDRB instruction causes the program to crash
