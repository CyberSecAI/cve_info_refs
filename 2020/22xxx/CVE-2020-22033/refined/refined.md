Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `convolution_y_8bit` function within the `libavfilter/vf_vmafmotion.c` file of the FFmpeg library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The code writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash/Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash of the FFmpeg process due to memory corruption.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can, in some cases, be exploited to execute arbitrary code by overwriting critical data structures, depending on the surrounding memory layout and if other preconditions are met. The Debian Security Advisory mentions "potentially the execution of arbitrary code if malformed files/streams are processed".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted or malformed media file using FFmpeg with the `vmafmotion` filter. Specifically, the provided example uses a crafted BMP image file (`PoC_vf_vmafmotion_179.bmp`) to demonstrate the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious media file**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted media file to the FFmpeg process for processing. This could be through a user opening the file directly, or in cases where an application using FFmpeg is processing user-provided media files.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is located at line 179 of `libavfilter/vf_vmafmotion.c`.
* The vulnerability was detected using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) during development.
* The provided ASAN log shows that the write of size 2 happens 32 bytes to the left of the allocated 64 byte region
* The ticket was marked as a duplicate of a similar vulnerability, #8241, which was already fixed.
* The vulnerability affects the git-master version of FFmpeg
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 7:4.1.8-0+deb10u1 in the oldstable (buster) distribution of Debian.

**Summary:** This CVE describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `vmafmotion` filter of FFmpeg that can be triggered by processing a crafted media file, which can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
