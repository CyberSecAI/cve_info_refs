This blog post discusses 4 post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities found in NagiosXI version 5.6.11. The author provides a link to a Patreon page where further details, including the exploit requests, a PDF write-up, and screenshots are available. The blog post itself provides a high-level overview, stating that there are four RCE vulnerabilities.

Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The specific root causes are not detailed in this post, but the existence of 4 separate RCE vulnerabilities suggests multiple issues within the NagiosXI software.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The blog mentions "4 RCE 0days". This indicates that the identified vulnerabilities allow for arbitrary code execution on the target system. The vulnerabilities are described as "postauth", implying that an attacker needs to have valid credentials to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows for Remote Code Execution, meaning that an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running NagiosXI.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors are not explicitly described, but the post implies they are network-based, as they involve sending requests to the NagiosXI server.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs valid credentials for NagiosXI to exploit the vulnerabilities (post-authentication).

This content relates to a vulnerability as it describes the existence of multiple RCE issues. However, the actual CVE-2020-22427 ID is not explicitly mentioned, making it hard to be certain if the blog refers to this specific CVE or another one.
