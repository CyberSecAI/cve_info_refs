Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper output encoding of user-supplied input within an AngularJS template. Specifically, user-controlled input is used to create a report name, which is then embedded into the unsubscribe link of an email notification without encoding. This allows for the injection of AngularJS expressions that are evaluated by the browser, leading to the execution of arbitrary Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **AngularJS Template Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided data when rendering AngularJS templates in the report name field.
*   **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The injected malicious code is stored in the database (as part of the report name), and then executed when a user opens the unsubscribe link.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The unsubscribe link does not require authentication, allowing an attacker to trigger the stored XSS even on unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they open the unsubscribe link, which can potentially lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.
    *   **Malware Installation:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    *   **Defacement:** Changing the content of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  The attacker crafts a malicious report name containing an AngularJS expression that executes JavaScript (e.g., `{{constructor.constructor('alert("XSS")')()}}`).
2.  The attacker triggers the email report function.
3.  The victim opens the unsubscribe link found within the email notification.
4. The browser executes the attacker's malicious Javascript payload when it renders the unsubscribe link page with the vulnerable report name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account that can create reports.
*   The attacker needs to be able to input the malicious payload in the report name field.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to trigger the XSS on other users because of the lack of auth on the unsubscribe link.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was initially identified as a self-XSS due to its location within the user's own profile. However, the attacker discovered a way to escalate it to a stored XSS through the unauthenticated email unsubscribe link.
*   The attacker exploited the fact that the unsubscribe link displayed the report name without any sanitization or authentication.
*   The article provides information that is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
