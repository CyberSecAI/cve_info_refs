The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PHPGurukul Hospital Management System v4.0, and includes details about SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability 1-11: SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from POST and GET requests into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and sanitization of user inputs before constructing SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated users can exploit these vulnerabilities to extract sensitive database information, potentially including user credentials, patient data, and other sensitive data. The attacker can also potentially modify or delete data.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    * HTTP POST requests to `user-login.php`, `forgot-password.php`, `registration.php`, `edit-profile.php`, `get_doctor.php`, `book-appointment.php`, `change-emaild.php`, `check_availability.php`, and `admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php`.
   * HTTP GET requests to `appointment-history.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The provided exploit examples include use of `sleep()` to confirm successful injection, but more damaging queries can be injected.

**Vulnerability 12: Sensitive Information Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause**: The application directly outputs query data without checking user authorization.
*   **Weaknesses**: Lack of authorization checks on viewing administrative data.
*   **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated users can access sensitive user data without proper authentication.
*   **Attack Vectors**: HTTP GET requests to `admin/appointment-history.php` and `admin/manage-users.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Vulnerability 13: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application stores unsanitized user input in the database and later outputs it without encoding, allowing execution of JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output encoding, allowing execution of JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Impact:** Remote registered users can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browser of other users (including admin). This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  A user submits a malicious payload through `book-appointment.php`.
    2.  An administrator views the appointments on the `admin/appointment-history.php` page, triggering the stored XSS payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user. They must be able to submit appointment data.
