- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The client name in the `config.ini` file, used in a distributed cluster setup, is not properly sanitized or encoded when displayed by the server. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code via the client name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the server interface where the vulnerable client name is displayed. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker modifies the client's `config.ini` file to include malicious script in the client's name field, e.g.,  `name = <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`. The server then reads this configuration and displays the unsanitized client name on the server interface, triggering the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the `config.ini` file on a client machine within the distributed cluster. This suggests a compromise of the client machine or network access to it.
