The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in `digg_add.php` of phpcms2007 sp6.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `digg_add.php` script does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `digg_mod` parameter. This parameter is directly used in a SQL query without any filtering, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `digg_add.php`
- Lack of input sanitization/validation for the `digg_mod` parameter
- Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL query

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain control of the database server. In the provided example, the attacker attempts to extract database information, including a md5 hash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `digg_add.php` with a malicious payload in the `digg_mod` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication.
