{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application constructs an SQL query by concatenating user-controlled input without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the `ExportData` function within the `modules/Vtiger/actions/ExportData.php` file of vtiger CRM. The `excluded_ids` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially taking complete control of the application's data.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `index.php` with the `module` parameter set to `Calendar`, `action` set to `ExportData`, and a malicious `excluded_ids` parameter containing SQL injection code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not require any pre-existing user authentication as indicated in the provided PoC."
