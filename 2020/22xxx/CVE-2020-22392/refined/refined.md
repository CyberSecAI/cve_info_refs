{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when handling blog images, specifically the 'file' attribute of the image data during editing, leading to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected blog post. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the 'file' attribute of an image within a blog post via the edit functionality, using an 'onerror' event handler. When the blog is viewed, the unsanitized data is rendered in the browser, triggering the malicious script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to add a blog and edit its properties. Specifically, they need to have the ability to modify the image file attribute and insert the malicious javascript."
