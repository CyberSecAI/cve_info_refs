Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22429:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `relibc` library of the Redox OS. The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of local variables' memory when returning from functions such as `gethostbyaddr`, `gethostbyname`, `getprotoent`, and `getservent`. Specifically, these functions create local vectors (e.g., `host_aliases`, `proto_aliases`, `serv_aliases`), obtain pointers to their underlying data, and store these pointers into a global structure (e.g., `HOST_ENTRY`, `PROTO_ENTRY`, `SERV_ENTRY`). When the local vector goes out of scope, the memory it occupied is deallocated, resulting in the global structure holding dangling pointers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The core vulnerability is that the global structures contain pointers that reference memory which has been freed. This leads to a use-after-free condition when the global structure's dangling pointer is accessed later.
- Incorrect memory management: The code fails to ensure that the memory pointed to by the global structure remains valid after the local vector is dropped. This indicates a flawed approach to memory management in these functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code Execution: If an attacker can control the content of the dangling memory, they may be able to cause arbitrary code execution, making this a highly critical vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack vector is local. It requires an attacker to be able to call the vulnerable functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user: An attacker needs to have the capability to execute code within the Redox OS environment and call the vulnerable functions.

**Additional Technical Details:**
The content provides specific code snippets illustrating the bug in each function:
-   `gethostbyaddr()`: The `host_aliases` vector is dropped after its pointer is stored in `HOST_ENTRY.h_aliases`, leading to a dangling pointer.
-   `gethostbyname()`: Similar to `gethostbyaddr()`, `host_aliases` is dropped, causing `HOST_ENTRY.h_aliases` to dangle.
-   `getprotoent()`: The `proto_aliases` vector is dropped, resulting in `PROTO_ENTRY.p_aliases` becoming a dangling pointer.
-   `getservent()`: Likewise, `serv_aliases` is dropped, causing `SERV_ENTRY.s_aliases` to dangle.

The fix involved storing the local variables to a global variable to prevent dropping.
The vulnerability was found by a static bug detector for rust named `lockbud`.
