The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the member submission function of the yzmcms project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The member submission function does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-submitted content, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through an `<img>` tag with an `onpointerout` event handler.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the content submitted by users, making it possible to inject malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can submit a crafted payload within a member submission containing the malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to submit content via the member submission function and wait for it to be approved. This suggests that an attacker would require an account on the system.
