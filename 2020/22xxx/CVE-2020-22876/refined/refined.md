The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in QuickJS, triggered by a crafted JavaScript code.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by unbounded recursion when calling an async function, leading to stack exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion when calling an asynchronous function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash (SIGSEGV) due to stack overflow.
- Potential for denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Executing a malicious JavaScript code with recursive async function calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the QuickJS environment.
