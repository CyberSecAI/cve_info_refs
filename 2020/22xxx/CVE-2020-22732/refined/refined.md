- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new profile within the File Picker functionality. Specifically, the 'name' field allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the File Picker. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator to access the File Picker functionality. The attack is triggered when an administrator creates a new profile with a malicious payload in the "name" field, and then views the file picker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative privileges within the CMS Made Simple application.
