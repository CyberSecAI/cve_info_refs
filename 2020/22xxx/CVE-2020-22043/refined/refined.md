- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory leaks in the `fifo_alloc_common()` function within the FFmpeg library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unreleased memory allocations, specifically a 40-byte direct leak and a 16-byte indirect leak, when using the `fifo_alloc_common()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leaks that can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially application instability if not handled properly.
- **Attack vectors:**  Exploitation occurs when FFmpeg processes crafted input files that trigger the vulnerable code path in `fifo_alloc_common()`, specifically when using the mpeg muxer. An example command line to trigger the vulnerability is provided as part of the bug report.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted input files to FFmpeg to trigger the memory leak, suggesting a local or network-based attack vector depending on the specific FFmpeg usage.
