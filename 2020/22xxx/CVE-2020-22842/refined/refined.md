- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `m1_mod` parameter within the `moduleinterface.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed within the victim's browser session, potentially allowing them to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL, specifically manipulating the `m1_mod` parameter in the `moduleinterface.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that they can then send to a user of the application. The user must also be logged in for the injected script to execute.
