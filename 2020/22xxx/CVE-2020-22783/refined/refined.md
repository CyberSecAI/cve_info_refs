Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the storage of user passwords in plain text within the database session storage. This occurs because the `SessionStore.js` file does not properly mask or hash the password before storing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plain Text Storage:** Passwords are being stored as plain text in the database.
- **Exposure Risk:** Anyone with access to the database could read the passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Malicious actors with database access could obtain user passwords, including admin passwords.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  Stolen passwords could be used to access and control the application or sensitive user data.
- **Full System Compromise:**  If admin credentials are stolen, the entire application can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Database Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by gaining direct access to the database where sessions are stored.
- **SQL Injection:** If the database is accessible through SQL injection, it might also expose the sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to read data directly from the database. This could be achieved through a compromised server, a malicious insider, or a vulnerability that leads to database access.
- **No Special Privilege:**  No special application-level privileges are required for the exploitation. Just the capability to read from the database.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves modifying `src/node/db/SessionStore.js` to replace the plain text password with a placeholder string `PASSWORD_HIDDEN` before storage, as seen in the provided commit diff.
- Issue #3421 on the GitHub repository clearly documents the plain text password storage vulnerability.
