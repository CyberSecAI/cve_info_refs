## Description

![@ukcb](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22983914?v=4&size=48)[ukcb](https://github.com/ukcb)opened [on Jul 10, 2018](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/3421#issue-339801634)

I can see my admin password in plain text in the database.

```
sessionstorage:-FWbiguBVxp1_VWLERNNheogwak9aewi {"cookie":
{"path":"/","_expires":null,"originalMaxAge":null,"httpOnly":true,"secure":false},
"passport":{},"user":{"password":"Here is a plain text password!",
"is_admin":true,"username":"admin"}}

```

That must not happen!
