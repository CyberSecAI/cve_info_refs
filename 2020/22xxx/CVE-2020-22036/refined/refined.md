Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22036:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `filter_intra` function located in `libavfilter/vf_bwdif.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  A memory write operation goes beyond the allocated buffer, potentially corrupting heap metadata or other data stored nearby.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  The overflow can corrupt memory, which may lead to various consequences, including program crashes, unexpected behavior, or even arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can be exploited to cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The provided ASAN log shows a crash caused by an out-of-bounds write, which supports this impact.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed in the provided information, heap-based overflows can sometimes be leveraged by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media File:** An attacker can craft a malicious media file that, when processed by FFmpeg's `bwdif` filter, triggers the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply a crafted media file:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted media file as input to FFmpeg.  This could be done through various means, such as providing it as a local file, through a network stream, or in any context where FFmpeg is used to process untrusted media.
- No special capabilities or privileges are mentioned beyond the ability to supply the input file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided ASAN log shows the exact line where the overflow happens (`libavfilter/vf_bwdif.c:133`) and provides the memory addresses involved in the crash.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA) and Debian LTS Advisory (DLA) list CVE-2020-22036 as one of several vulnerabilities fixed in their respective updates.
- The vulnerability is specifically related to the `bwdif` filter in FFmpeg.
- The provided information states that the vulnerability can lead to potential memory corruption and denial of service, which are consistent with the nature of heap-based buffer overflows.
