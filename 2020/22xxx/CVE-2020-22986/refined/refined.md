The provided content describes multiple reflected cross-site scripting (rXSS) vulnerabilities found in a Facebook system utilizing the MicroStrategy Web SDK.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** The `UploadFileTask` class processes data from uploaded files and renders it without proper output encoding.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding for user-controlled data. Specifically, the content of the uploaded file was directly reflected in the response without sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of `m-nexus.thefacebook.com`. An attacker can execute scripts on client machines, potentially gathering information or manipulating the DOM.
*  **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted HTML page with JavaScript, hosted on the attacker's server, is used to send a file to the vulnerable endpoint via a POST request, triggering the XSS vulnerability when the page is visited. The attacker tricks the victim to click a link to the attacker's malicious page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to host a web page and trick a victim to visit the malicious page. The attacker does not need to control the contents of the file itself, but they control the HTML that submits the file upload POST request.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** The `wikiScrapper` task, used for scraping Wikipedia content, processes the `searchString` parameter without output encoding when it starts with `http://` or `https://`.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of output encoding of user-supplied input in the `searchString` parameter. The task fetches content from a URL provided in the parameter and reflects it in the response without proper sanitization.
*  **Impact:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of `m-nexus.thefacebook.com`.
*   **Attack vector:** The attacker hosts a specially crafted HTML page with a malicious JavaScript payload (XSS payload). The attacker crafts a link to the vulnerable endpoint, appending the URL of the malicious page to the `searchString` parameter. When the victim opens the crafted link in a browser, the malicious HTML is fetched and reflected in the response, thus executing the payload.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to host a web page with a specific structure and craft the malicious URL containing the hosted page's link. They need to entice the victim to click the malicious link.

**General Information**

*   The vulnerable domain `m-nexus.thefacebook.com` is no longer publicly accessible.
*   The reported issues were fixed by Facebook.
*   The researcher received a five-figure bounty for reporting multiple XSS vulnerabilities, including the ones mentioned above.
