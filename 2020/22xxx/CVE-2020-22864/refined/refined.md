Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when inserting video embeds, specifically through the "Embedded Code" option. The application does not adequately filter or encode the provided embed code before rendering it in the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious code within the embed code, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can perform malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies/session information.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker uses the "Embedded Code" functionality in the "Insert Video" feature of the WYSIWYG editor.
- The attacker provides a crafted `EMBED` tag containing a data URI that embeds an SVG with an embedded `<script>` tag. This script executes arbitrary JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to use the WYSIWYG editor and insert video embeds, specifically through the "Embedded Code" option.
- The attacker needs to be able to paste the malicious payload into the "Embedded Code" field.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit is an `EMBED` tag with an embedded SVG containing a script:
   ```html
   <EMBED/SRC="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxuczpzdmc9Imh0dH A6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcv MjAwMC9zdmciIHhtbG5zOnhsaW5rPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8xOTk5L3hs aW5rIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjAiIHg9IjAiIHk9IjAiIHdpZHRoPSIxOTQiIGhlaWdodD0iMjAw ICIgaWQ9InhzcyI+PHNjcmlwdCB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2VjbWFzY3JpcHQiPmFsZXJ0KCJUaGVyZSBpcyBhIFhTUyIpOzwvc2NyaXB0Pjwvc3ZnPg==">
