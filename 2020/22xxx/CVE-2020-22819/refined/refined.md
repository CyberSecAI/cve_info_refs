The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in MKCMS V6.2, specifically within the `/ucenter/repass.php`, `/ucenter/active.php`, and `/ucenter/reg.php` files.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the incorrect usage of `stripslashes()` on user-supplied input (`$_POST['name']` in `/ucenter/repass.php` and `/ucenter/reg.php`, and `$_GET['verify']` in `/ucenter/active.php`) before using them in SQL queries. The CMS attempts to sanitize input by using `addslashes()` on all request parameters, but then incorrectly uses `stripslashes()` before querying the database, negating the effect of the escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL injection due to the usage of `stripslashes()` after addslashes().

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches (e.g., retrieving usernames and passwords), data modification, or complete control of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable pages (`/ucenter/repass.php`, `/ucenter/active.php`, `/ucenter/reg.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerabilities. They can send crafted requests with malicious SQL payloads through the vulnerable parameters (`name` in `/ucenter/repass.php` and `/ucenter/reg.php`, and `verify` in `/ucenter/active.php`).
