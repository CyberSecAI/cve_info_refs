Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-22550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `zip.php` file of the Veno File Manager. It allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path to be included in a zip archive, bypassing intended access controls. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the `filesarray` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. By manipulating the `filename` variable in the `compress()` function, an attacker can include files outside of the intended directory in the generated ZIP archive.
- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The `filesarray` parameter, which is base64 encoded, is directly processed without proper validation, allowing for the injection of malicious file paths.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The application does not properly enforce access controls on which files can be included in the ZIP archive, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to. This includes sensitive files, configurations, or other application data.
- **Information Disclosure:** The contents of arbitrary files on the server can be exposed to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `zip.php` endpoint. The `filesarray`, `time`, and `dash` parameters are sent in the body of the request.
- **Base64 Encoding:** The attacker base64 encodes the desired file path (including path traversal sequences) and sends it as the value of `filesarray`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable instance of Veno File Manager.
- **Knowledge of `time` and `dash` Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the correct `time` and `dash` parameters. However, it's possible these may be static or easily obtainable. The provided code assumes these are available.
- **Basic Scripting Knowledge:**  The provided exploit is written in Python.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Python script acts as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for exploiting this vulnerability.
- The script first compresses the target file into a zip archive and then downloads and extracts it to display the file's contents.
- The `veno.py` script requires the hostname, dash and time arguments to perform the exploit.
- The script iteratively reads files.
- The provided CodeCanyon page for Veno File Manager confirms this is the product in question.
