- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory leak in the `sgpd_parse_entry` function within the `box_code_base.c` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `sgpd_parse_entry` function allocates memory but does not free it in certain code paths, leading to a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeated execution with crafted input can lead to excessive memory usage, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition. The provided ASAN output shows a leak of 37 bytes, but this could increase with more executions or crafted inputs.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted MP4 file input to the `MP4Box` utility is used to trigger the memory leak.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to the `MP4Box` utility. This can be done locally or remotely if the utility is processing user-provided files.
