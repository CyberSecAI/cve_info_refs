The provided content relates to CVE-2020-22882.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A type confusion vulnerability exists in the handling of array access within the `fxParserTree` function, specifically when assigning a value to an undefined array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Type confusion: The code incorrectly identifies an undefined array as a temporary function type.
- Improper object reference: The error occurs when processing object references in the parser tree.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The type confusion can lead to undefined behavior and potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption. The provided traceback shows a crash, indicating a severe impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript code can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted JavaScript code to the vulnerable engine. The provided PoC demonstrates this.
