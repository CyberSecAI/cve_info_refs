    {
      "source": "medium.com_52dc87ae_20250119_122327.html",
      "root_cause": "The MicroStrategy Web SDK, specifically the `shortURL` task, did not properly validate the source URL, allowing it to fetch content from arbitrary URLs. Additionally, the `WikiScrapperTask` and the `validateServerURL` function in the `com.microstrategy.web.app.utils.usher` class also suffered from SSRF vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
        "Inadequate URL Validation",
         "Lack of authentication check on some endpoints"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could perform SSRF attacks, potentially leading to:\n - Information disclosure by fetching internal resources.\n - Port scanning of internal network services.\n - Cross-site scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious content. \n - Phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious pages that appear to be legitimate facebook pages.\n - Fingerprinting internal services running on the network behind the firewall.\n - Leaking sensitive information such as internal path to logs folder, other file paths, internal system queries, internal IP addresses, private documents, etc. via url shortener vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted request to the `/servlet/taskProc` endpoint with a `taskId` parameter set to `shortURL` and `srcURL` parameter set to a tinyurl that redirects to a malicious URL.",
        "Manipulating parameters of `WikiScrapperTask` class to trigger blind SSRF",
        "Manipulating the `serverURL` parameter of `validateServerURL` function in `com.microstrategy.web.app.utils.usher` class to trigger SSRF",
        "Performing dictionary based brute force attack on facebook's URL shortening service."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and also needs to craft tinyurls."
