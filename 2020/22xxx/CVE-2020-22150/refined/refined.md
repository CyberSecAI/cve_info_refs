RELATED: CVE-2020-22150
  - Root cause of vulnerability: XSS vulnerability in the permalinks functionality.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A POST request to /admin.php?page=permalinks with a crafted payload in the permalink parameter. The payload is a SVG tag with an onload event that executes JavaScript code.
  - Impact of exploitation: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
  - Attack vectors: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the 'permalink' parameter in the /admin.php?page=permalinks page.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker likely needs to be authenticated to access the admin panel.
