Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `admin_ads.php` file of joyplus-cms version 1.6. The `file` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The application does not validate or sanitize user-provided input (`file` parameter), allowing access to files outside the intended directory.
- **Unrestricted File Read:** An attacker can use the path traversal vulnerability to read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read configuration files like `config.php` that contain sensitive information such as database credentials, potentially leading to database compromise.
- **Full File System Read:** By escalating the path traversal attack, an attacker can read other sensitive files on the server, leading to further exploitation of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request that includes the `file` parameter with a malicious path.
- **Direct Access to Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs direct access to the `admin_ads.php` script and has to be logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker needs to be able to log in into the admin panel
- The attacker has to send a crafted GET request to `admin_ads.php`

**More Details than CVE Description:**

The provided information details the exact file (`admin_ads.php`) and parameter (`file`) responsible for the vulnerability, provides a concrete example of how to exploit the vulnerability using a crafted URL, and demonstrates the impact by showing how to read the `config.php` file. It also points out that the admin panel login is required, making the attack less easily executable.
