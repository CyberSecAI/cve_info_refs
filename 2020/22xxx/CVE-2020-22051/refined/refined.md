- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory leaks occur in the `filter_frame()` function of the `vf_tile` filter in FFmpeg. Specifically, memory allocated for frames is not properly freed when using the `tile` filter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leaks, leading to resource exhaustion if the filter is used repeatedly or for long durations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The memory leaks can cause the program to consume increasing amounts of memory, which could lead to performance degradation, and ultimately crashing due to out-of-memory errors.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted input with the `tile` filter. The provided PoC, a `bmp` file, demonstrates how to trigger the leak when combined with the `ffmpeg` command provided in the ticket.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to control the input to ffmpeg and specify the filter complex using `tile`.
