The provided content discusses multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities in MicroStrategy Web SDK, which is relevant to CVE-2020-22984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `uploadFile` task and the `wikiScrapper` task within the MicroStrategy Web SDK process user-supplied data and render it without proper output encoding, leading to reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (rXSS):** The application does not sanitize or encode user-provided data before displaying it in the response, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `uploadFile` task processes uploaded file contents without properly validating or sanitizing it.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:**  The application fails to encode the output, reflecting user-provided content directly back to the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable application's domain.
*   **Information Gathering:** Malicious scripts can gather information about the userâ€™s system and send it to a third-party.
*   **Session Hijacking/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially manipulate the application's DOM and perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **`uploadFile` task:** The attacker can create a malicious HTML form that uploads a file containing JavaScript code. The server will process the file and render its contents directly into the HTML response without sanitization.
*   **`wikiScrapper` task:** The attacker provides a URL to a malicious HTML page via the `searchString` parameter. The server fetches the HTML content and reflects the content (including any embedded JavaScript) without output encoding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **For `uploadFile`:** The attacker needs to host a web page containing an HTML form to upload a file containing malicious JavaScript code. The victim must be tricked into accessing the attacker's page.
*   **For `wikiScrapper`:** The attacker needs to host a specially crafted webpage with embedded JavaScript. They must then create a URL that calls the `wikiScrapper` task with a `searchString` parameter pointing to the hosted malicious webpage. The victim must access this URL to trigger the XSS.

**Additional details:**
The content provides more detailed information than a typical CVE description, including:
*   The specific vulnerable tasks: `uploadFile` and `wikiScrapper`
*   The method of exploitation for each vulnerability
*   The vulnerable code locations (`com.microstrategy.web.tasks.UploadFileTask` class)
*   The use of `jd-gui` for decompiling the MicroStrategy SDK

The article states that the `m-nexus.thefacebook.com` domain is no longer publicly accessible, suggesting that the reported vulnerabilities have been fixed.
