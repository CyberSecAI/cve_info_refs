The provided content describes multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting (rXSS) vulnerabilities found in a MicroStrategy Web SDK instance deployed on Facebook's production servers. The vulnerabilities were identified and exploited by security researcher Bipin Jitiya.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities stem from the MicroStrategy Web SDK's improper handling of user-supplied data within various tasks, specifically `uploadFile` and `wikiScrapper`. The SDK fails to sanitize or encode user-provided input before rendering it in the HTML context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  * **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (rXSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS, where malicious scripts are injected through user input and immediately reflected back to the user.
    *   `uploadFile` task: Processes data from an uploaded file and renders it without output encoding, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution.
    *   `wikiScrapper` task: The `searchString` parameter is vulnerable to XSS when a URL is provided as input. The content from this URL is then rendered without proper encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  * **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable domain (`m-nexus.thefacebook.com`). This allows for various malicious activities, such as:
     * Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
     * Redirecting users to malicious websites.
     * Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
     * Gathering information about the system.
     * Manipulation of application DOM to trick a user into unintended tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**
   * `uploadFile` task: An attacker needs to create a malicious HTML page that includes a form for file upload. The form will submit a file with the malicious JavaScript payload.
   * `wikiScrapper` task: An attacker creates a specially crafted web page containing the malicious JavaScript and then uses the page's URL as input for the searchString parameter in the `wikiScrapper` task.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  * For both vulnerabilities, the attacker must host a malicious web page to deliver the exploit.
  * The attacker must trick the victim into clicking a crafted link, either for the `uploadFile` form or the `wikiScrapper` URL, to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

The researcher discovered and reported 5 rXSS vulnerabilities, for which they received a five-figure bounty. Facebook has since fixed the reported issues and the vulnerable domain is no longer publicly accessible.
