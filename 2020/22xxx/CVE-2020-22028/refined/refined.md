Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22028:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `filter_vertically_8` function located in `libavfilter/vf_avgblur.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow allows writing data beyond allocated buffer memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can cause a denial of service (DoS). Based on other similar CVEs in this advisory, it could also potentially lead to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted media file. Specifically, the `avgblur` filter is used with an input, demonstrated with a bmp file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted media file that will be processed by ffmpeg.
- The attacker does not need local access, as this could be triggered remotely through a service that uses ffmpeg.

**Additional details:**
- The provided ticket includes a command line example to reproduce the issue, as well as an AddressSanitizer (ASAN) log showing the exact location and type of the overflow. This indicates the vulnerability was easily identified and reproduced with ASAN.
- The fix for the issue is included in `ffmpeg` version `7:3.2.15-0+deb9u3` for Debian 9 and version `7:4.1.8-0+deb10u1` for Debian 10.
- The ASAN log indicates the overflow occurs when reading size of 4 bytes out-of-bounds in the `filter_vertically_8` function.
