The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `ajax_street.php` file of the 74cms 3.2.0 plus application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input. The `$alphabet` variable, which is taken directly from the `x` GET parameter, is directly used in a SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query through the `x` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- Data breach: The attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, as demonstrated in the provided proof of concept.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker sends a malicious HTTP GET request to the `ajax_street.php` file, providing a malicious SQL payload in the `x` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Basic knowledge of SQL: The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `x` passed as a GET parameter.
- The vulnerable file is `upload/plus/ajax_street.php`.
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can use the SQL injection to extract the admin username and password hash: `/plus/ajax_street.php?act=alphabet&x=11ï¿½' union select 1,2,3,concat(0x3C2F613E20),5,6,7,concat(0x4E56535F544553542D2D,admin_name,0x3A,pwd,0x2D2D4E56535F54455354),9 from qs_admin#`
