Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization when processing user-provided data. Specifically, the `realname` field from the database is displayed without filtering HTML special characters, particularly angle brackets `<` and `>`, allowing for injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS injection. By injecting malicious HTML into the `realname` field during registration, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when the vulnerable page (`cal_scores.php`) is accessed.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize or encode user-provided data before displaying it, which is the root cause for the XSS vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to a variety of malicious actions, such as:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
        *   Displaying phishing messages
        *   Modifying the page content
        *   Stealing user cookies
    *   **Account Compromise:** Although not directly mentioned, if an admin user is targeted, the impact could be higher, potentially enabling an attacker to gain administrative access.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **User Registration:** The attacker injects malicious code through the `realname` field during the user registration process on `/OJ/modifypage.php`.
    *   **Vulnerable Page:** The XSS is triggered when an admin visits `/OJ/admin-tools/cal_scores.php` and the application renders the unsanitized `realname` value from the database.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to create an account and modify the `realname` field through the registration page.
    *   The attacker needs an admin user to access the vulnerable page to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, along with screenshots illustrating the attack process.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) code ` <details open ontoggle=['yds_is_so_handsome'].find(\u0070rompt)>` shows a specific example of the malicious payload injected into the `realname` field, triggering an alert box when the page is loaded.
