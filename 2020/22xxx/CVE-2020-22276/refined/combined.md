##### Takedown

Filebin provides functionality for clients to upload and download files.

There is an opportunity to abuse this to share illegal, copyrighted or malicious content, even though this is against the [Terms and conditions](/terms). There is no automatic moderation of such content, but anyone familiar with the location of the files can delete them at their own will.

If this bin contains files that should not be here, please delete the bin. This will immediately make the files unavailable, and is faster than sending a takedown request to the service owner.

If you need to contact the service owner, please reach out at contact@filebin.net.
