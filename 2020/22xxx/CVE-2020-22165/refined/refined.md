The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 4.0.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection (Multiple Instances):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple PHP files before using them in SQL queries.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and sanitization, direct embedding of user-controlled data into SQL queries
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or complete database compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP POST requests to vulnerable PHP files, manipulating POST parameters (e.g., username, fullname, email, etc). HTTP GET request for /hms/appointment-history.php
    *  **Required capabilities:**  An attacker can be unauthenticated and can send HTTP requests.
    *   **Affected files:**
        *   `\hms\user-login.php`
        *   `\hms\forgot-password.php`
        *   `\hms\registration.php`
        *    `\hms\edit-profile.php`
        *   `\hms\get_doctor.php` (2 instances)
        *   `\hms\appointment-history.php`
        *   `\hms\book-appointment.php`
        *   `\hms\change-emaild.php`
        *   `\hms\check_availability.php`
        *   `\hms\admin\betweendates-detailsreports.php`

2.  **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to view sensitive data.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of proper authorization checks, direct output of query data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user information, including personal details.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  Direct HTTP GET requests to vulnerable admin PHP files.
    *   **Required capabilities:** An attacker can be unauthenticated and send HTTP requests.
    *   **Affected files:**
        *   `\hms\admin\appointment-history.php`
        *   `\hms\admin\manage-users.php`

3.  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Unfiltered output of user-supplied data in admin panel.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on behalf of admin users.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Registered users submit a malicious script as the value of the "Doctorspecialization" parameter in the appointment form.
     *   **Required capabilities:** An attacker needs to be a registered user and have the capability to make HTTP POST requests.
    *   **Affected files:**
        *  `\hms\admin\appointment-history.php`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report highlights that multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited using a time-based blind SQL injection technique using `sleep()` to confirm data exfiltration.
*   The report notes a privilege escalation vulnerability where session data can be manipulated to bypass the `check_login` function. This is because of how the login page sets the `$_SESSION['login']` variable.
