The provided content discusses a SQL injection vulnerability in 74cms version 3.2.0, specifically within the `ajax_officebuilding.php` file. This aligns with the general nature of a CVE related to SQL injection.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `x` parameter passed to the `ajax_officebuilding.php` script is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization or filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to retrieve sensitive data from the database.
- In this particular instance, the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the ability to extract the `admin_name` and `pwd` (password) from the `qs_admin` table. This could lead to complete compromise of the system if those credentials are valid for admin access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `ajax_officebuilding.php` endpoint.
- Specifically the `act=alphabet` parameter is required along with the malicious SQL code in the `x` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- No special user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, since the described endpoint is publicly available.
