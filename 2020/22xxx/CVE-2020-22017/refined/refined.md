Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `ff_fill_rectangle` function located in `libavfilter/drawutils.c` at line 341.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A write operation attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer boundaries on the heap. Specifically, the `__asan_memcpy` function is triggered with an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash caused by the heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided content, heap-buffer-overflows can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, depending on the context and the ability to control the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed input file (specifically, the PoC.pfa file) with the `oscilloscope` filter.
*   **FFmpeg Command:** The command `ffmpeg_g -y -i $PoC -filter_complex oscilloscope tmp.mp3` demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a specifically crafted input with the oscilloscope filter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to provide a crafted input file that, when processed by FFmpeg, will trigger the overflow in the vulnerable function.
*   The attacker needs the ability to execute the `ffmpeg` command with the crafted input file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided ASAN log indicates a write of 4 bytes to an address located 64 bytes before the allocated region's start. This detailed information gives a clearer picture of the memory corruption than the high level description alone
*   The vulnerability was fixed, as indicated in the trac ticket status.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4990-1) mentions CVE-2020-22017 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the updated `ffmpeg` package.
*   The vulnerable code is within the `oscilloscope` filter processing path.
