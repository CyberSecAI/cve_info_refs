The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Phpjabbers Fundraising Script 1.0, but it is not related to CVE-2020-22223. The content describes SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `cid` parameter in various `pjFront` controller actions (`pjActionLoad`, `pjActionSetAmount`, and `pjActionLoadForm`).
*   **XSS:** Lack of proper output encoding/sanitization, allowing for injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in the `pjActionLoadCss` and `pjActionPreview` actions.
*   **CSRF:** The XSS vulnerabilities can facilitate CSRF attacks by manipulating user sessions through malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cid` parameter within GET requests. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL operators.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks in `pjActionLoadCss` and `pjActionPreview` by injecting malicious JavaScript via the URL.
*   **CSRF:** The described XSS vulnerabilities can be used to perform CSRF attacks by injecting malicious JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Data exfiltration by querying sensitive database tables (e.g., users).
    *   Potential for server compromise by injecting malicious SQL payloads.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Stealing user cookies, potentially allowing attackers to hijack user sessions.
    *   Executing malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser.
*  **CSRF:**
    *   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of a victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  HTTP GET requests manipulating the `cid` parameter.
*   **XSS:**  Crafted URLs with injected JavaScript code through GET requests.
*   **CSRF:** Crafted URLs and JavaScript exploiting XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   For XSS attacks, the attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that executes the crafted URL.

The content provides detailed examples of payloads and responses, demonstrating the successful exploitation of SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides specific vulnerable URLs and payloads that can be used to reproduce the vulnerabilities.
*   The SQL injection payloads utilize `EXTRACTVALUE()` to extract data from the database.
*   The XSS payloads use an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event to execute JavaScript.

**CVE Relevance:**

This content does **NOT** relate to CVE-2020-22223 as there are no details in the provided content that maps to the official CVE description for it.
