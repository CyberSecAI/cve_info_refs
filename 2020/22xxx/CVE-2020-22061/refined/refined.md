The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `saskutil64.sys` driver of SUPERAntiSpyware. This aligns with the description of CVE-2020-22061, which is related to a vulnerability in SUPERAntiSpyware.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `SaskCallDriver` function in the `saskutil64.sys` driver allows user-mode applications to send arbitrary I/O requests to kernel-mode devices. This function takes a `CALL_DRV` structure as input, which contains the target device name, data to be written, the size of the data, and the starting offset for the write operation.
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of API results within the `SaskCallDriver` function, specifically when calling `IoGetDeviceObjectPointer` and `IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest`. The driver does not check the return values of these critical functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Error Checks:** The driver fails to check the return values of `IoGetDeviceObjectPointer` and `IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest`. This omission allows a user-mode application to pass an invalid device name to the function which leads to a crash.
*  **Backdoor functionality:** The driver exposes functionality to user-mode application which should not be directly available.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):** An attacker can cause a system crash (bugcheck/BSOD) by supplying an invalid device name to the `SaskCallDriver` function.
*   **Arbitrary Kernel Writes:** By supplying a valid device name, offset, and data an attacker can cause arbitrary writes in kernel-mode, potentially overwriting critical system data or executing malicious code.
*   **Data wiping:** As described in the comments, this can be used for data wiping

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any local user.
*   **IOCTL:** The driver exposes the vulnerable functionality via a device IO control code. An attacker would open the device using `CreateFile` and then send the malicious request via `NtDeviceIoControlFile`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the system where SUPERAntiSpyware is installed.
*   The attacker needs the ability to open the `\\.\SASKUTIL` device using CreateFile, send IOCTLs, and construct a malicious `CALL_DRV` struct.
