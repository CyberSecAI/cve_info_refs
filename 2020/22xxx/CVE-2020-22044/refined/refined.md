Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a memory leak in the `url_open_dyn_buf_internal` function located in `libavformat/aviobuf.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak**: The `url_open_dyn_buf_internal` function allocates memory but fails to free it under certain conditions, leading to a memory leak. This can eventually exhaust available memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: A successful exploit of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service due to the memory leak exhausting system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted input file (as evidenced by the provided PoC file). Specifically, the `nut_write_trailer` function calls `url_open_dyn_buf_internal`, which contains the memory leak, when processing the input.
    - The provided PoC file (`PoC_url`) is a nut file that triggers the leak when processed.
   
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted input file to the vulnerable FFmpeg instance.
- No special privileges or network access are needed beyond the ability to provide input to the ffmpeg program.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided ticket information from trac.ffmpeg.org includes a Valgrind and ASAN log showing the memory leak and confirms the issue.
- The provided debian-lts advisory confirms the vulnerability and specifies the vulnerable function, as well as the fact that the vulnerability is a memory leak leading to DoS.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `1d479300cbe0522c233b7d51148aea2b29bd29ad`.
