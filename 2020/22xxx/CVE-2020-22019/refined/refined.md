Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22019:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `convolution_y_10bit` function within the `libavfilter/vf_vmafmotion.c` file of FFmpeg.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `convolution_y_10bit` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow. Specifically, the read occurs at `ffmpeg/libavfilter/vf_vmafmotion.c:180`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a crash due to the memory corruption. While not explicitly stated, this could lead to denial of service. The Debian security advisory mentions "denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code".

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted media file with the `vmafmotion` filter. The provided example uses a PNG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to provide a malicious media file that is processed by FFmpeg with the vulnerable `vmafmotion` filter. This could occur in various scenarios, such as a user opening a malicious file or a server processing user-uploaded content.

**Additional details:**
- The provided information includes a complete ASAN log detailing the crash. The log shows the exact location of the vulnerability, which function calls that lead to the crash, and which memory address is involved.
- The ticket also includes a PoC (Proof of Concept) image that can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The issue was resolved by a patch which was submitted to ffmpeg-devel and is available here: [https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2021-May/280737.html](https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2021-May/280737.html)
