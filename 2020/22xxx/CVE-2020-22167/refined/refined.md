The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 4.0. It outlines 13 distinct vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application directly incorporates user-supplied POST or GET parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe use of user-provided data in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `\hms\user-login.php`: Exploiting the `username` parameter in a POST request.
        *   `\hms\forgot-password.php`: Exploiting the `fullname` and `email` parameters in a POST request.
        *   `\hms\registration.php`: Exploiting the `full_name`, `address`, `city`, `gender`, and `email` parameters in a POST request.
        *   `\hms\edit-profile.php`: Exploiting the `fname`, `address`, `city`, and `gender` parameters in a POST request. Requires a bypass of the login check using the username session variable.
        *   `\hms\get_doctor.php`: Exploiting the `specilizationid` parameter (two instances) in a POST request.
        *   `\hms\appointment-history.php`: Exploiting the `id` parameter in a GET request, requires bypass of login check
        *   `\hms\book-appointment.php`: Exploiting `Doctorspecialization`, `doctor`, `fees`, `appdate`, and `apptime` in a POST request, requires bypass of login check.
        *   `\hms\change-emaild.php`: Exploiting the `email` parameter in a POST request, requires bypass of login check
        *    `\hms\check_availability.php`: Exploiting the `email` parameter in a POST request.
        *   `\hms\admin\betweendates-detailsreports.php`: Exploiting the `fromdate` and `todate` parameters in a POST request, requires bypass of login check.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote unauthenticated users can extract sensitive database information.
        *   Database user can be obtained.
        *   Possible to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
        
2.  **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate access control on certain pages, allowing unauthenticated users to view sensitive data.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of authentication checks, directly outputting the query data without checking for admin permissions.
    *    **Attack Vectors:** Direct access to `/hms/admin/appointment-history.php` and `/hms/admin/manage-users.php`
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data (including personal info).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to access the vulnerable pages via HTTP requests.

3.  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of output sanitization, allows the injection of malicious javascript through user-controlled input.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe output of user-provided data.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   A registered user injects a malicious script into the `Doctorspecialization` field via the `/hms/book-appointment.php` form, which is then stored in the database.
        *   The stored script is then executed in the context of the admin user in `/hms/admin/appointment-history.php` when they view the appointment data.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions against the admin user.
        *   Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**
        *   Registered user account.
        *   Ability to submit a crafted HTTP request to `/hms/book-appointment.php`
        *  An administrator to view the affected data at `/hms/admin/appointment-history.php`

The report details the methods of exploitation for each vulnerability, including the specific HTTP requests and parameters that can be used to trigger the flaws. It also includes the login bypass using a session variable, necessary to exploit some of the vulnerabilities.
