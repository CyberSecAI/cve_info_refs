The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PHPGurukul Hospital Management System v4.0. Here's a breakdown of the relevant CVE details:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** The application suffers from SQL injection vulnerabilities in several files due to direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries without sanitization.  Vulnerable files include:
    *   `user-login.php`
    *   `forgot-password.php`
    *   `registration.php`
    *   `edit-profile.php`
    *   `get_doctor.php` (appears twice)
    *   `appointment-history.php`
    *   `book-appointment.php`
    *   `change-emaild.php`
    *   `check_availability.php`
    *   `admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php`
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The application discloses sensitive information due to a lack of proper authorization checks in:
    * `admin/appointment-history.php`
	* `admin/manage-users.php`
*  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A persistent XSS vulnerability exists in `admin/appointment-history.php`, where user-supplied data is output without proper sanitization.

**Root Causes:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary cause for SQL injection is the direct embedding of user-provided data (from POST or GET requests) into SQL queries without any form of sanitization, escaping, or parameterized queries.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The lack of proper authorization checks on certain pages allows unauthenticated or unauthorized users to view sensitive data.
*  **Persistent XSS:**  The XSS vulnerability stems from user-controlled input being stored in the database and later displayed in the admin panel without any output encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attackers can bypass authentication.
    *   Attackers can retrieve sensitive database information.
    *   Attackers can potentially modify or delete data.
    *   Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**
    *   Attackers can access user data (e.g., personal information, appointment history) without proper authorization.
*   **Persistent XSS:**
    *   Attackers can execute malicious scripts in the administrator's browser when they view specific pages. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and further attacks against the administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** HTTP POST and GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files. Specifically, manipulating parameters like `username`, `fullname`, `email`, `full_name`, `address`, `city`, `gender`, `specilizationid`, `doctor`, `id`, `Doctorspecialization`, `appdate`, `apptime`, `fromdate`, and `todate`.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Direct HTTP GET requests to vulnerable pages such as `admin/appointment-history.php` and `admin/manage-users.php`
*   **Persistent XSS:** By injecting malicious scripts into appointment data through the `book-appointment.php` form (e.g., in the `Doctorspecialization` field), which will later be displayed in `admin/appointment-history.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** No authentication required in most cases. The attacker can make unauthenticated HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability. In a few cases, the attacker needs to bypass the check_login function which can be done by making a login request with any username, which will make the session variable not empty.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** No authentication or special privileges required. The attacker can access the vulnerable pages directly.
*   **Persistent XSS:** Requires a user account to book an appointment and inject malicious code.  The attack then targets the administrator.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The attacker can use time-based SQL injection techniques (e.g., using `sleep()`) to confirm successful injection and extract data.
*   The content includes example payloads demonstrating how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerable version is specifically mentioned as PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 4.0 with Apache/PHP 7.0.12.
* The document mentions that  `edit-profile.php`, `appointment-history.php`, `book-appointment.php`, `change-emaild.php`, and `admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php` use a vulnerable login check that can be easily bypassed.
*   The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including vulnerable code locations and specific exploit examples.
