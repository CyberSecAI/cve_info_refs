Hi,

On our server we were getting some Etherpad outage. We relied it to a nasty query:

```
https://pad.bling.org/javascripts/lib/ep_etherpad-lite/static/js/pad.js?callback=require.define&vLtF%3D6904%20AND%201%3D1%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%201%2CNULL%2C%27%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22XSS%22%29%3C%2Fscript%3E%27%2Ctable_name%20FROM%20information_schema.tables%20WHERE%202%3E1--%2F%2A%2A%2F%3B%20EXEC%20xp_cmdshell%28%27cat%20..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%27%29%23

```

A "minimal" query example:

```
https://pad.bling.org/javascripts/lib/ep_etherpad-lite/static/js/pad.js?callback=require.define&vLtF%3D6904%20AND%201%3D1%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%201%2CNULL%2C%27%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C%2Fscript%3E%27

```

This provoke an immediate crash:

```
oct. 23 18:17:19 pad.bling.org run.sh[8976]: [2018-10-23 18:17:19.994] [ERROR] console - Error: ENAMETOOLONG: name too long, open '/var/www/etherpad-lite/var/minified_L2phdmFzY3JpcHRzL2xpYi9lcF9ldGhlcn

oct. 23 18:17:20 pad.bling.org run.sh[8976]: [2018-10-23 18:17:20.091] [INFO] console - db sucessfully closed.

```

We are running the 1.7.0 flavor on Debian Stretch with node v6.14.4 and no specific customization.

We reproduced the behavior on two independents Etherpad installation.
