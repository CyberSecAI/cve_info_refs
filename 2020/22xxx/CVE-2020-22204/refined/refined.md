Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** ECShop version 2.7.6
*   **Location:** `flow.php`
*   **Root Cause:** The `flow_update_cart` function in `flow.php` uses a value from `$_POST['goods_number']`. While the code attempts to cast the *value* of `goods_number` to an integer, it fails to sanitize the *key* (index) of the `goods_number` array. This oversight allows an attacker to inject SQL code through a crafted `goods_number` array key.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious `goods_number` array key (e.g., `goods_number[-1' and(select ...)`), an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application.
*   **Impact:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow the attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords).
    *   Modify data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain complete control of the server, depending on the database user's privileges.
*   **Example Payload:** The provided example payload aims to extract the `user_name` and `password` from the `ecs_admin_user` table:

    ```
    goods_number[-1' and(select 1 from(select count(*),concat((select (select concat(0x7e,0x27,user_name,0x7c,password,0x27,0x7e)) from ecs_admin_user limit 0,1),floor(rand(0)*2))x from information_schema.tables group by x)a)# and '1'='1] = value
    ```
