Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-22845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `ftpd` process in MikroTik RouterOS does not properly check the length of incoming requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The lack of request length validation allows an attacker to send an excessively large payload.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `ftpd` process accepts and processes the oversized payload without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Reboot:** Sending a large payload can exhaust memory, leading to a system reboot.
*   **Denial of Service:** The reboot causes a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the FTP service.
*   **Malicious FTP Request:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted, very long payload as part of the initial FTP request.
*   **Unauthenticated Exploitation:** Authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Mikrotik RouterOS device.
*   **FTP Port Access:** The attacker needs access to the port on which the FTP service is running.
*   **Ability to craft and send network packets:** The attacker needs the capability to send network packets with arbitrary payloads to the FTP port.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "memory exhaustion vulnerability."
*   The payload does not need to be a valid FTP request. Any large payload is enough to trigger the issue.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of RouterOS before 6.47 (stable release tree).
*   The vendor was notified and has released a fix in version 6.47.1.
