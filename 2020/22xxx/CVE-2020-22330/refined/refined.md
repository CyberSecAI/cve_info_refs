Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization/neutralization of user-controlled input when it's incorporated into web page output. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Specifically, the application does not neutralize user-supplied input, such as the page title, allowing the injection of malicious code that will be executed when the page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a vulnerable website. This can lead to:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
  - Other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through user-supplied input fields that are not properly sanitized.
- Specifically, the vulnerable input field is the "title" field when creating or editing a page within the Subrion CMS.
- The injected payload is triggered when a user adds a new block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have an account to log in to the CMS.
- The attacker has to navigate to the "contents->Pages->Add page" section of the CMS and add the malicious payload in the "title" field.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, just the ability to create/edit pages.
