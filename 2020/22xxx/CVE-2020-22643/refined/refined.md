{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper file name sanitization during the avatar upload process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Lack of file name filtering",
      "Direct movement of temporary files without validation"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files (including executable files like PHP shells) through the avatar upload functionality, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the server. This allows the attacker to gain control over the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the avatar upload functionality, specifically in the `/common/models/AdminUser.php` file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to access the avatar management module. After gaining administrator access, the attacker can upload malicious files."
