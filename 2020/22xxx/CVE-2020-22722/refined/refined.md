{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to weak folder permissions on the installation directory of Rapid SCADA. The default installation directory C:\\SCADA allows all users to read, write, execute, create, and delete files within it, including subfolders due to the Object Inherit (OI) and Container Inherit (CI) ACL rules.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak folder permissions",
      "Lack of access control for the service executable location"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM by replacing a legitimate service executable with a malicious one. This gives the attacker full control of the system, including the ability to execute arbitrary code, install software, modify settings, and access data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "File system manipulation"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the target Windows system and the ability to write files into the C:\\SCADA directory.",
    "details": "The vulnerability exists because the 'C:\\SCADA' directory and its subfolders have overly permissive ACLs (Access Control Lists), allowing any user to read, write, and execute files. The 'ScadaAgentSvc.exe' service executable is located within this directory, which allows an attacker to place a malicious executable with the same name. Upon system restart, the Windows service starts the replaced malicious 'ScadaAgentSvc.exe' binary with SYSTEM privileges, giving the attacker full access. The vulnerability was demonstrated by planting a reverse shell and obtaining a remote shell as 'NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM' before any user logs into the system. The vulnerability affects Rapid SCADA version 5.8.0."
