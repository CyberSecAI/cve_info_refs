The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the PHPGurukul Hospital Management System 4.0. The identified vulnerabilities are:

**1. Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in various PHP files, allowing for direct insertion of SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.
   - **Vulnerable Files:** `user-login.php`, `forgot-password.php`, `registration.php`, `edit-profile.php`, `get_doctor.php`, `appointment-history.php`, `book-appointment.php`, `change-emaild.php`, `check_availability.php`, `admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php`.
   - **Impact:**
      - Attackers can bypass authentication
      - Gain access to sensitive database information
      - Potentially modify or delete data
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted HTTP POST or GET requests with malicious SQL code in parameters such as username, email, full_name, address, city, gender, id, specilizationid, doctor, fromdate, todate etc.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated users can exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in `user-login.php`, `forgot-password.php`, `registration.php`, `get_doctor.php`, `check_availability.php` and `admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php`. For `edit-profile.php`, `appointment-history.php`, `book-appointment.php`, and `change-emaild.php`, attackers need to first visit `/hms/user-login.php` and attempt a login to set a session.

**2. Sensitive Information Disclosure Vulnerability:**
   - **Root Cause:** Lack of proper authorization checks in multiple areas within the application.
    - **Vulnerable Files:** `\hms\admin\appointment-history.php` and `\hms\admin\manage-users.php`.
   - **Impact:**
     - Attackers can gain access to sensitive user and appointment data without proper authentication.
   - **Attack Vector:** Accessing vulnerable pages directly through the web browser.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated users can access these pages and view sensitive information without being logged in.

**3. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**
    - **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization when saving or displaying user-supplied data within the application.
   - **Vulnerable File:** `\hms\admin\appointment-history.php`
   - **Impact:**
       - Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application which can be executed when the administrator views the data. This can allow for session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
   - **Attack Vector:** Submitting an appointment record containing a malicious JavaScript payload in `hms/book-appointment.php`. The injected script is then executed when the administrator views the `hms/admin/appointment-history.php` page.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a registered user to inject the malicious payload. An admin user must view the malicious payload for the XSS to be triggered.
