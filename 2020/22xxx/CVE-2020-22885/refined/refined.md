- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by excessive recursion during garbage collection, specifically within the `jsG_markproperty` and `jsG_markobject` functions. This occurs when a long chain of bound functions is created, leading to deep recursion in the garbage collection marking phase.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way the garbage collector traverses and marks objects, particularly when dealing with bound functions. The recursive nature of `jsG_markproperty` and `jsG_markobject` combined with deeply nested bound function chains leads to uncontrolled stack growth.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit of this vulnerability results in a stack overflow, leading to a crash of the application or service. In a real-world scenario, this could result in denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the creation of a long chain of bound functions. The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates the creation of such a chain, where functions are repeatedly bound to each other using the `bind()` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within an environment that uses the vulnerable `mujs` engine and have the ability to craft complex JavaScript that creates a long chain of bound functions.
