Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow located in the `config_input` function within the `libavfilter/af_tremolo.c` file of the FFmpeg library. Specifically, the overflow occurs at line 135 during a write operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is that the `config_input` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided information indicates that this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Heap-based buffer overflows often result in memory corruption, which can have broader consequences such as program instability and potentially, code execution.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, heap overflows can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, depending on the specifics of memory layout and how the overflow is triggered.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specific crafted audio file (`PoC_2.VOC`) with the `tremolo` filter in FFmpeg. The specific command line used for reproduction was: `ffmpeg_g -y -i $PoC_1 -i $PoC_2 -filter_complex tremolo -target dv tmp.vividas`
*   **Processing Malformed Streams/Files:**  The vulnerability is triggered when `ffmpeg` processes malformed files/streams as mentioned in the Debian Security Advisory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable FFmpeg instance with a specially crafted audio file/stream designed to exploit the overflow.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Code:** The vulnerable code is located at `libavfilter/af_tremolo.c:135` in the `config_input` function.
*   **ASAN Log:** The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) log provided shows the exact location of the heap-buffer-overflow and the call stack leading to it, which helps in debugging and confirming the vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Version:** The fix was introduced in commit `58bb9d3a3a6ede1c6cfb82bf671a5f138e6b2144`, which is mentioned in the ticket's change history.
*   **Affected versions:** The Debian LTS advisory indicates that version 7:3.2.15-0+deb9u3 fixes the issue on Debian 9 (stretch), and version 7:4.1.8-0+deb10u1 fixes the issue on Debian oldstable distribution (buster).
