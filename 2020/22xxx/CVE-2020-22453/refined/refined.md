The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in WebUntis, an electronic classbook software, but **does not directly relate to CVE-2020-22453**, as it focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities and not a specific vulnerability. The described vulnerabilities were found in 2019 and disclosed in 2020, while the CVE was assigned in 2020, the content however does not specify a direct link.

Here's a summary of the vulnerabilities discussed in the provided content:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper request validation, allowing an attacker to send requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
    *   **Weakness:** Missing CSRF protection mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Sending unauthorized messages, potentially manipulating communication between teachers or causing them to perform actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link (e.g., in an email).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the target user to be logged into WebUntis and visit a malicious site.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users, enabling data manipulation (e.g., changing grades, deleting classbook entries), data theft (e.g., stealing authentication tokens), and bypassing security measures like two-factor authentication.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Injecting malicious scripts through various input fields such as messages and attachments.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a way to inject a payload into the vulnerable input fields.

**Combined Impact:**
    * The combination of CSRF and XSS allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor initially downplayed the severity of the issues, particularly XSS, by incorrectly asserting that an attacker needed to be authenticated.
*   The vendor attempted to prevent disclosure by offering a "bug bounty," which the researcher declined due to concerns about potential legal issues.
*   The vendor initially implemented a filter to block JavaScript, a measure considered insufficient compared to proper input validation and output encoding.
*   The researcher noted additional XSS vulnerabilities in a part of the application that was not yet officially released, but which was still exploitable.
*   The document indicates that at the time of the report publication, not all issues were resolved, specifically vulnerabilities related to attachments in the private messages functionality.
*   The report also covers the timeline of the vulnerability discovery and reporting, the communications with the vendor, and the challenges encountered.
