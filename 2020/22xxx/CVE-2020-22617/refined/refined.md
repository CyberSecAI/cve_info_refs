Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2020-22617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the `xml++.cc` file of the Ardour project. Specifically, the code attempts to free an `xmlXPathContext` structure using `xmlXPathFreeContext` and then subsequently tries to free the document associated with that context (`ctxt->doc`) using `xmlFreeDoc`, which is already freed in `xmlXPathFreeContext` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Double free due to freeing the same memory (the document associated with `ctxt`) twice.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation would require crafting a specific XML document or XPath query to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to provide or influence the input to the Ardour application such that the vulnerable `xml++.cc` code is executed with a crafted XML document and XPath.
