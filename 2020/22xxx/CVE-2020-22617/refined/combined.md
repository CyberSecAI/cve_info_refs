| Summary | 0007926: use after free: issue when using libxml2 API 'xmlFreeDoc' and 'xmlXPathFreeContext' | | | | |
| Description | I find a 'use after free' vulnerability when I read ardour' source code at Github. This issue lies in 774 line, 782 line of ardour/libs/pbd/xml++.cc. After releasing the 'ctxt' structure using 'xmlXPathFreeContext', the next line try to free 'ctxt->doc'. I haven't done an experiment to verify it yet, but I think it's a problem. PS, xmlXPathFreeContext, xmlFreeDoc are APIs of libxml2. | | | | |
