Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22042:

**1. Verification:**

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4998-1) lists CVE-2020-22042 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the ffmpeg package. The provided ticket from trac.ffmpeg.org discusses a memory leak in `libavfilter/graphparser.c` which is related to the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a memory leak in the `link_filter_inouts` function within `libavfilter/graphparser.c`. This occurs when filter graphs are parsed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The code allocates memory for `AVFilterInOut` structures but fails to free it under certain conditions, leading to a memory leak.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation of the memory leak could eventually exhaust available memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition. Although the provided information shows a leak of 32 bytes, a repeated exploitation can lead to a DoS.
- The Debian Security Advisory also mentions potential arbitrary code execution as an impact of multiple vulnerabilities.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed Input Files/Streams:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing malformed or crafted media files or streams that utilize filter graphs that exhibit this memory leak. The provided ticket contains a PoC (Proof of Concept) file named `PoC_graphparser.wav` demonstrating the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need the ability to supply a crafted input file that triggers the faulty code in `libavfilter/graphparser.c`. This could be an untrusted file/stream processed by a vulnerable ffmpeg installation.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-22042 involves a memory leak in FFmpeg's filter graph parsing functionality. A specially crafted input file can cause the `link_filter_inouts` function to leak memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service. The provided information from trac.ffmpeg.org details the exact location of the memory leak and provides a PoC demonstrating its exploitation. The Debian Security Advisory confirms that this vulnerability, along with other related issues, has been addressed in a security update to ffmpeg.
