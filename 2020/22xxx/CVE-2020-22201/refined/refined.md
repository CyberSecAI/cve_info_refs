  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `pagesize` parameter in `yp/product.php` is directly passed to the `$urlrules` variable without any filtering. This variable is later used in an `eval` function, allowing for arbitrary PHP code execution.",

      "Unfiltered user input",
      "Code injection",
      "Use of eval()"

    "impact": "Arbitrary command injection leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious `pagesize` parameter in the URL.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `product.php` script."
