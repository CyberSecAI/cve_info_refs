Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a memory leak in the `wtvfile_open_sector` function located in `wtvdec.c`. This function is responsible for handling the opening and processing of WTV (Windows Television) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Memory Leak:** The core weakness is a memory leak, which means that memory is allocated but not freed, leading to a gradual consumption of available memory. Specifically the allocated memory in `wtvfile_open_sector` using `avio_alloc_context` when the header read fails is not freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly triggering this memory leak by processing specially crafted WTV files can lead to a denial of service condition. As memory gets consumed, the system may become unstable or unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the processing of a malformed WTV file. An attacker can provide a specially crafted WTV file to the vulnerable application (FFmpeg or an application using FFmpeg) which would trigger the memory leak when the header read fails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted WTV file, either through direct file input or by having the application process a file from a network location, etc.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information also includes details about the fix for this vulnerability in ffmpeg commit `373c1c9b691fd4c6831b3a114a006b639304c2af`.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Suhwan and was reproduced by the developers.
