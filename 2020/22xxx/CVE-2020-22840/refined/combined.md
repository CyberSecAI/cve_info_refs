* ## Start with a homepage

  Once b2evolution is installed on your own web server or [web hosting](http://b2evolution.net/web-hosting/) account, you might want to introduce your website with a home page.

  Change the photo, the title, the intro text... and you've got your very own homepage.

  When you're done with the home page, you can start adding more sections (a.k.a. Collections) to your site. They will appear in the main navigation bar at the top...

  b2evolution runs your site on **your own domain**.

  It can also run on a **subdomain**, in a **subfolder** or on **multiple domains**.
  This **optional site-wide header** can be used as a top-level navigation menu for your site.
  **Front Page Container**

  You can configure which widgets appear here and in which order.
* ## Add a blog

  With 3 additional clicks your website gets a blog section.

  Write something. Hit "publish". It's live!

  You may also immediately start customizing your site design:

  + Choose a different Skin: Example 1, 2, 3, Bootstrap
  + Customize your skin with skin settings
  + Add, remove and re-arrange skin widgets
  + Optionally customize your CSS
  + If you fancy, dig into the open-source PHP codeYou can **configure the URLs** for each of your collections. In this case we chose a sub-folder.
  **Header Container**

  Though this will typically display the Blog title, you can configure which widgets appear here and in which order.
  **Menu Container**

  You can configure which tabs appear here and in which order.
  **Sidebar Container**

  You can configure which widgets appear here and in which order.
  When you write an **intro post**, it always appears before regular posts. You can write a global intro but also specific intros for your categories or tags.
  **Same Content, Different Skin**

  Changing skins doesn't change the content. I just gives a different look to your site (or a section of your site).
  **Same Widgets, Different Styles**

  When changing skins, your widgets remain in the same order, but each skin may style them differently.
* ## Multiple blogs done right!

  Multiple blogs can be used as different sections of your website.

  You could also have loosely connected blogs by letting each member of your organization, community or family customize their own space to their own taste.

  b2evolution was designed for multiple blogs from day one and makes management really easy:

  + All skins and all plugins are compatible with multiple blogs ;
  + Each blog can run in a different subfolder, different subdomain or different domain ;
  + You can easily move posts and comments from one blog to another ;
  + You can cross-post into multiple blogs at once !**Configurable navigation**
  Each of your blogs or collections may or may not appear in your main site navigation. You have total control.
  This blog has been configured to have a special **Front Page** with a global intro for the blog.
* ## Share your photos

  ### Photo Albums

  Organize your photos into Albums and show them off in a neutral design that lets your art shine!

  Albums open into contact sheets of thumbnails of customizable size. Each thumbnail can be viewed in full screen through a lightbox which allows zooming in to the highest available resolution of your photos.

  Slideshow mode & keyboard navigation included.

  ### Photo Blogs

  If you prefer a linear story with added text, we also have skins just for that!

  **Albums View**

  This page shows your albums. Clicking on an album will open the Thumbnails View.
  **Thumbnails View**

  This page shows thumbnails for all photos in an album. Clicking on a thumbnail will open the photo in a lightbox.
  **Zooming in on details**

  If the original image is of higher resolution than the viewer's screen, the mouse cursor will turn into a spyglass allowing the user to zoom in on any part of the image.
* ## Connect your community

  By adding forums ‚Äì a.k.a. Bulletin Boards ‚Äì to your website, your community can stay in touch with each other by sparking conversations on the topics they care about.

  b2evolution‚Äôs forums can be enabled on your site in 3 clicks. No plugin necessary. No integration issues.

  Feature highlights:

  + File attachments in discussion threads
  + User profiles & directory
  + Private messaging between users
  + Advanced multi-level moderation
  + Efficient spam killing featuresb2evolution includes full community features, including customizable user profiles and private messaging.
* ## Publish with structure

  Manuals, books and documentation often require a structured **hierarchy of chapters and sub-chapters**, contrary to blogs, which are typically organized by date.

  Each manual can have its own assigned contributors. Each page can have its own attachments (images, videos, downloads) as well as a feedback/comment feed if needed.

  Manuals can be navigated hierarchically or searched in full-text. You can also easily create transverse hyperlinks from one page to another using easy Wiki-like markup.

  **Tree-View Browsing**

  The most distinctive feature of a Manual-type collection is that its contents are organized into Chapters and Sub-Chapters rather than a linear "by-date" ordering.

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
