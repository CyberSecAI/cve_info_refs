Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22035:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4990-1) explicitly lists CVE-2020-22035 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the ffmpeg security update. The advisory mentions that multiple vulnerabilities in the FFmpeg framework could lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution, which aligns with the general nature of vulnerabilities in media processing software. The report from ffmpeg's Trac system provides a detailed report of a heap-buffer-overflow in the bm3d filter which is believed to be the cause of CVE-2020-22035.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `get_block_row` function within `libavfilter/vf_bm3d.c` at line 375. This issue occurs during the processing of the bm3d filter in ffmpeg.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a heap-buffer-overflow, meaning that a write operation attempts to access memory beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer on the heap. This can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a crash or enabling arbitrary code execution.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** The heap-buffer-overflow can cause the program to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
-  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** More critically, the memory corruption could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they can carefully craft an input file that exploits the overflow in a controlled manner.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Media File:** The primary attack vector involves processing a specially crafted media file (e.g., a BMP file, based on the provided PoC) using ffmpeg's bm3d filter. This triggers the vulnerability within the `get_block_row` function.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Provide Input File:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious media file to be processed by ffmpeg. This could be through user interaction (e.g., a user opening a malicious file), a web server processing user-uploaded media, or any other situation where ffmpeg is used to handle untrusted media data.

**Additional Details:**

-   **Specific Function and Line:** The vulnerability is localized to `libavfilter/vf_bm3d.c:375` within the `get_block_row` function.
-   **ASAN Log:** The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) log clearly identifies the heap-buffer-overflow, the location of the overflow in the code, and the allocation information related to the buffer overflow.
-   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC BMP file named `PoC_vf_bm3d_375.bmp` was attached to the ticket report, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be triggered.
-   **Affected Component:** The affected component is the `bm3d` filter in libavfilter.
-   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability is present in the git-master version of ffmpeg, and is patched in later versions.
-   **Reproducibility:** The provided command line (`ffmpeg_g -y -i $PoC -filter_complex bm3d -target svcd -loglevel 99 tmp.lmlm4`) allows for easy reproduction of the issue.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-22035 is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `bm3d` filter of FFmpeg. It can be triggered by processing a specially crafted media file, leading to denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided report, PoC file and ASAN log provide extensive details to confirm this finding.
