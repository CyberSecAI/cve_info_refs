- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `dump_data_hex` function located in `isomedia/box_dump.c:51`. This is triggered by a crafted input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow. The `dump_data_hex` function attempts to read beyond the allocated memory buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the application. It can potentially be exploited for more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution, though the provided information does not confirm this.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted input file that when parsed by the `MP4Box` utility triggers the heap-buffer-overflow in the `dump_data_hex` function. The specific input file `003-heep-dump_data51` can be used for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.
