Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22041:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

   - The Debian LTS advisory explicitly lists CVE-2020-22041 and describes it as "A Denial of Service vulnerability due to a memory leak in the av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags function in buffersrc."
   - The ffmpeg ticket #8296 also discusses memory leaks associated with `av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags()`.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a memory leak within the `av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags` function. Specifically, the `av_frame_alloc` function allocates memory but is not properly freed, resulting in a leak when `av_buffersrc_add_frame_internal` is called and eventually `ifilter_send_frame` calls `av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags` repeatedly.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Memory leak: Allocated memory for frames is not being released, leading to memory exhaustion.
   - Unfreed resources: The `av_frame_alloc` function allocates memory that is not freed when the function is called within a loop.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Denial of Service (DoS): Repeatedly triggering the memory leak can exhaust system memory, leading to the crash of the affected service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - Input file processing: An attacker can craft a malicious input file that triggers the `av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags` function repeatedly during processing.
   - The `ffmpeg` command used in the reproduction steps shows that the memory leak can be triggered by using the `-filter_complex` option.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file or control the parameters of the `ffmpeg` command to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details from provided content:**

*   **Vulnerable Function:**  `av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags` in `buffersrc.c` is identified as the source of the leak.
*   **Memory Allocation:** The leak is caused by calling `av_frame_alloc` within a loop via `av_buffersrc_add_frame_internal` without releasing the allocated frame.
*  **Reproducibility:** The provided `ffmpeg` command line and Valgrind/ASAN logs detail how to reproduce the memory leak and which code paths are involved in the allocation.
*   **Affected Versions:**  The issue was found in `git-master` and fixed in `7:3.2.16-1+deb9u1` in the Debian LTS release.
*   **Valgrind and ASAN Logs:** The logs show the specific memory allocation paths that are leaking memory, as well as the amount of memory lost with each leak. These logs also show that there are many indirect memory leaks besides the direct one.

**Summary of findings:**

The provided content confirms the memory leak vulnerability in `av_buffersrc_add_frame_flags`, leading to a DoS when processing a crafted input file or with specific `ffmpeg` command line options. The content from the trac ticket and the Debian LTS advisory confirm the cause, impact and vulnerable function.
