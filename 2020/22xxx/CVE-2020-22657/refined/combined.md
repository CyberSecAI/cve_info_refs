The ZoneFlex R310 is the industry’s lowest cost enterprise class 802.11ac access point. The R310 has dual radios (2.4GHz & 5GHz) which are capable of concurrent operation. It is a 2x2:2 stream access point, offering up to 867Mbps of physical layer throughput in the 802.11 a/n/ac 5GHz range, with an additional 300Mbps physical layer throughput in the 802.11 b/g/n 2.4 GHz range. It has a single Gigabit Ethernet port and can be powered by 802.3af PoE or a 12V DC power supply. The R310 has a compact form factor (13.8cm x 13.5cm x 3.3cm) is extremely helpful in easy installation, and enables the power of 802.11ac literally in the palm of your hand.

It is perfect for low client density deployments such as coffee shops, convenience stores and other brick & mortar establishments, where cutting edge WiFi is necessary, but there is only a lean IT staff to manage the network. The R310 is a perfect entry level enterprise class 802.11ac access point that delivers maximum value at minimal cost.

With simplicity and ease of use in mind, the RuckusZoneDirector 1200 is purpose-built to address the gap between standalone, feature-deficient access points (APs) that must be individually managed and the costly, complex high-end enterprise systems that are overkill for most small business environments.

The Ruckus ZoneDirector 1200 can be deployed and operated by non-wireless experts and installed quickly and easily. Any organization with limited IT staff and budget can create a robust and secure multimedia WLAN in a matter of minutes.

This controller is focused on small to medium enterprise business, which scales up to 150 AP’s, 4,000 client devices, and 256 WLANs.  The ZD 1200 works with the ZoneFlex AP’s to deliver a highly reliable and easy to manage Wi-Fi network. The pay as you grow licensing system allows you to start with a standard license for 5 AP’s and grow to a maximum of 150 AP’s with a granularity of one AP license.
