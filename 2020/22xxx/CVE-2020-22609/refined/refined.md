The provided content is related to CVE-2020-22609.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `Name` field for a Queue was vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application was not sanitizing user-supplied input for the queue name before displaying it, allowing malicious HTML/JavaScript code to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the Queue name field. When an administrator views the queue or any related pages, the malicious script would execute in their browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to access the page where a new queue can be created or edited and then input the malicious code in the "queue name" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the osTicket admin interface with the required privileges to create or edit queues.
