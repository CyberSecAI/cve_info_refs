xss: Queue Name

```
This mitigates an issue discovered by Matthew Aberegg where the Name field
for a Queue can be exploited via XSS to execute code. This sanitizes the
`$_POST['queue-name']` variable in a few places via `Format::htmlchars()` so
we are safe from any XSS attempts on creations and updates.
