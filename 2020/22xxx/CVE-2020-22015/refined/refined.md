Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `mov_write_video_tag` function within the `libavformat/movenc.c` file of the FFmpeg library. The root cause is an out-of-bounds write, specifically an attempt to write to an index exceeding the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, meaning that the memory corruption occurs on the heap, which can be more complex to exploit.
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The specific vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, where the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer boundary, causing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could allow a remote malicious user to obtain sensitive information by reading from memory outside of allocated buffer.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The memory corruption can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** In some cases, a heap-based buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code by overwriting return addresses or other critical data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted .mov file:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted `.mov` file. An attacker can create a specifically crafted file that when processed by a vulnerable FFmpeg installation would cause the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote user:** A remote user can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed .mov file to the vulnerable FFmpeg application for processing. This could be done by tricking a user into opening the file or delivering it as an attachment or part of network stream.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located at `libavformat/movenc.c:2049`.
*   The overflow occurs when writing video tags.
*   The issue is triggered by a specific set of input parameters, which in the provided example, include looping the input stream, setting the output format as MOV and using a specific frame rate and video bitrate.
