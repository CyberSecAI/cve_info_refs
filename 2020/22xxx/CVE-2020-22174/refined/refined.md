   - **Root cause:**  Unsanitized user-supplied input (`username` POST parameter) is directly incorporated into an SQL query.
   - **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
   - **Impact:**  Remote unauthenticated users can extract database information. The examples demonstrate using time-based blind SQL injection to infer database content.
   - **Attack vector:** HTTP POST request to `/hms/user-login.php` with a crafted `username` parameter.
   - **Attacker capability:**  No special access is needed; an unauthenticated user can trigger this.

**[2] SQL Injection in `forgot-password.php`**
   - **Root cause:** Unsanitized user-supplied inputs (`fullname` and `email` POST parameters) are directly incorporated into an SQL query.
   - **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated users can extract database information through blind SQL injection.
   - **Attack vector:** HTTP POST request to `/hms/forgot-password.php` with crafted `fullname` and `email` parameters.

**[8] SQL Injection in `book-appointment.php`**
    - **Root cause:**
        - The `check_login` function can be bypassed by simply visiting the `user-login.php` and submitting any username (even a wrong one) which will set `$_SESSION['login']`, thus bypassing the authentication check.
    - Unsanitized user-supplied inputs (`Doctorspecialization`, `doctor`, `fees`, `appdate`, and `apptime` POST parameters) are directly incorporated into an SQL query.
   - **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability and an authentication bypass.
   - **Impact:** Remote, authenticated users (or users that bypassed the authentication) can extract database information through blind SQL injection.
   - **Attack vector:** HTTP POST request to `/hms/book-appointment.php` after bypassing the `check_login` function with crafted vulnerable parameters.
    - **Attacker capability:** No direct authentication required, but a session variable must be set through a crafted request to the user-login.php page.

**[9] SQL Injection in `change-emaild.php`**
    - **Root cause:**
        - The `check_login` function can be bypassed by simply visiting the `user-login.php` and submitting any username (even a wrong one) which will set `$_SESSION['login']`, thus bypassing the authentication check.
    - Unsanitized user-supplied input (`email` POST parameter) is directly incorporated into an SQL query.

   - **Attack vector:** HTTP POST request to `/hms/admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php` after bypassing the `check_login` function with crafted vulnerable parameters.
   - **Attacker capability:** No direct authentication required, but a session variable must be set through a crafted request to the user-login.php page.

**[12] Sensitive Information Disclosure**
   - **Root cause:** Lack of authorization checks before displaying sensitive information in `/hms/admin/appointment-history.php` and `/hms/admin/manage-users.php`.
   - **Weakness:** Information disclosure vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated users can view all user information and appointment data.
   - **Attack vector:** HTTP GET requests to `/hms/admin/appointment-history.php` or `/hms/admin/manage-users.php`.
   - **Attacker capability:** No special access is needed; an unauthenticated user can trigger this.

**[13] Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `admin/appointment-history.php`**
   - **Root cause:** Unsanitized data from the `Doctorspecialization` field during appointment booking is stored and later displayed without proper encoding.
   - **Weakness:** Persistent XSS vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Registered users can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute when an admin views appointment history. This allows for cookie theft.
   - **Attack vector:**  A registered user makes an appointment through `/hms/book-appointment.php` with an XSS payload in the `Doctorspecialization` field. When an administrator accesses `/hms/admin/appointment-history.php`, the payload is executed.
    - **Attacker capability:** Requires a valid registered user account to book an appointment and an admin user to view the appointment history.

In summary, the content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities due to a lack of input sanitization and an authentication bypass in the hospital management system. Additionally, it identifies a sensitive data disclosure and a persistent XSS vulnerability. All of these vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated or low-privileged users to compromise the system in various ways.
