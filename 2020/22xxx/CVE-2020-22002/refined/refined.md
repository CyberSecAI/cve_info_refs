{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application parses user supplied data in the GET parameter 'host' to construct an image request to the service through onvif.cgi without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Lack of input validation on the 'host' GET parameter"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can specify an external domain and force the application to make an HTTP request to an arbitrary destination host. This can be used to bypass firewalls and initiate a service and network enumeration on the internal network through the affected application, leading to potential exposure of system information and unauthorized access to internal resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request with a malicious 'host' parameter"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected SmartLiving device, which implies a network connection to the device's web interface."
