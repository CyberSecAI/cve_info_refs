Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly used in an SQL query. Specifically, the `key` parameter in the `plus/ajax_street.php` file is processed using `iconv` and then directly injected into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection. User-provided input is directly incorporated into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query's logic and potentially access or modify the database.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The code fails to properly sanitize the `key` parameter before using it in the database query, making the system vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database compromise: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive data, modify database entries, or potentially gain control over the database server.
- Data breaches: Attackers may extract sensitive user data or application-specific information from the database.
- Application compromise: Depending on the database user privileges, attackers might be able to gain control over the application by injecting malicious SQL commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`plus/ajax_street.php`).
- The `key` parameter is the attack vector and is injected in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the SQL injection using the `union select` clause to extract information, which is then hashed using `md5` for easier retrieval.
- The code snippet in the issue clearly shows the path of the vulnerable parameter (`$keys`) directly from user input to SQL execution.
- The code snippet shows the user of the PHP function iconv before the SQL query is constructed.
