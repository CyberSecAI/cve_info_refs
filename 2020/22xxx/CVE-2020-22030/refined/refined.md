Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22030:

**CVE Description:**
The provided text doesn't contain the official CVE description.

**Analysis:**

* **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists within the `crossfade_samples_fltp` function in the `libavfilter/af_afade.c` file. This overflow occurs during the processing of audio crossfades.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary weakness is a heap-based buffer overflow, where the code writes data past the allocated memory region.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Crash:** The provided ASAN log shows that the overflow causes a program crash due to memory corruption.
    * **Potential Code Execution:** Although the immediate impact observed is a crash, heap-based buffer overflows can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited more carefully.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Malicious Media Files:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted media files. In this case, the vulnerability is triggered by using the `-filter_complex acrossfade` filter on two input files (`PoC1_af_afade_436.vob` and `PoC2_af_afade_436.wav`).

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **File Access:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted media file as input to ffmpeg.
    * **ffmpeg Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute `ffmpeg` to process the malicious media.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was identified using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) during testing.
*   The vulnerable code is in `libavfilter/af_afade.c` at line 436 in the function `crossfade_samples_fltp`.
*   The provided steps to reproduce the issue involves running ffmpeg with the `-filter_complex acrossfade` filter on two provided audio files.
*   The vulnerability was fixed, as indicated by the ticket status.
* The debian security advisory lists the CVE as part of a batch of vulnerabilities fixed in a ffmpeg update.
