Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The `DeleteFile` function in the FlatPress application is accessible via an unauthenticated GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application lacks anti-CSRF tokens, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
*   **Unauthenticated GET Request:** The `DeleteFile` function can be triggered without authentication checks, allowing anyone to attempt a file deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can delete any file on the server, which may lead to data loss, website malfunction, or other forms of disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A malicious user can craft a link or form that, when accessed by a logged-in administrator, will trigger the `DeleteFile` function and delete a file without the administrator's consent.
*   This can be done via a malicious website, email, or any other medium that can deliver a crafted request to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable URL, including the location of the file they want to delete.
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user (an administrator) into visiting the malicious link or form.
