## Description

![@lethanhtrung222](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14830322?v=4&size=48)[lethanhtrung222](https://github.com/lethanhtrung222)opened [on Apr 19, 2020](https://github.com/flatpressblog/flatpress/issues/64#issue-602718274)
```
In the source code, the DeleteFile function  is sent via unauthenticated GET method. (fp-plugins\mediamanager\tpls\admin.plugin.mediamanager.files.tpl
		<td>
			<a class="link-delete" href="{$mmbaseurl}&deletefile={$v.type}-{$v.name}">{$plang.delete}</a>
		</td>
The application does not have anti-csrf tokens, so it is vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery attacks. The vulnerability allows delete any file.
