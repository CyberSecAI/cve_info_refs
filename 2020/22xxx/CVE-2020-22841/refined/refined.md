Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-22841:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content reveals that CVE-2020-22841 is associated with a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in b2evolution version 6.11.6.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when modifying a plugin name. Specifically, the application allows a malicious user to inject JavaScript code into the plugin's name field. This injected code is then stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS: The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This type of XSS is more dangerous than reflected XSS because the malicious script is permanently stored within the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin management interface of the b2evolution CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- High Privileges: The attacker must have an account with high privileges to access the plugin management page within the b2evolution CMS.

**Technical Details:**
1.  The attacker logs in with an account having high privileges.
2.  The attacker navigates to the plugin management page.
3.  The attacker selects any plugin and changes its name to `"><svg/onload=alert(123)>`.
4.  The payload is stored in the database.
5.  When another user with similar privileges visits the plugin management page, the stored JavaScript is executed in their browser.
