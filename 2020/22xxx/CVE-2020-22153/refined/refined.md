The provided content describes a vulnerability in FUEL-CMS related to code execution during navigation/upload, which aligns with the description of CVE-2020-22153.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses `@eval()` to execute the content of uploaded files after minimal filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unrestricted file upload leads to code execution.
    - Insecure use of `eval()` function on user-controlled input.
    - Insufficient sanitization; only `<?php` tags are removed and `xss_clean` is applied which is insufficient to prevent code execution
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing attackers to create webshells and potentially gain full control of the system.
    - System takeover through arbitrary command execution
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Uploading a crafted file containing PHP code, that is base64 encoded to bypass the php tag filtering, through the navigation upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the navigation upload functionality.
