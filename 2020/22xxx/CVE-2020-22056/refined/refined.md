The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in FFmpeg's `config_input()` function, specifically within the `af_acrossover.c` file, as identified by a user named Suhwan. This memory leak occurs during the processing of audio using the `acrossover` filter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Memory is allocated within the `config_input()` function (specifically, at line 170 of `af_acrossover.c`) using `av_calloc` but is not properly freed when the filter configuration completes or fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in `config_input()` function
- Improper memory management within the audio filtering process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A memory leak accumulates over time when the vulnerable filter is used, leading to increased memory consumption which could eventually lead to crashes or denial-of-service if enough memory is consumed.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Processing a specially crafted audio file using the `acrossover` filter in FFmpeg. The user provided a proof-of-concept (PoC) file named `PoC_con.ogg`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to provide the malicious audio file to an FFmpeg instance.

This issue was later marked as fixed.
