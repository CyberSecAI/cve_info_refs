The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in MKCMS V6.2, but does not mention CVE-2020-22818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application uses `addslashes_deep()` to escape input, but then uses `stripslashes()` before constructing SQL queries, negating the escaping and leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `/ucenter/repass.php` via the `name` parameter (POST)
- SQL injection vulnerability in `/ucenter/active.php` via the `verify` parameter (GET)
- SQL injection vulnerability in `/ucenter/reg.php` via the `name` parameter (POST)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET/POST requests with malicious SQL code in the vulnerable parameters

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and can send a crafted request with the vulnerable parameter.

**Mitigation:**
- Remove the use of `stripslashes()` before constructing SQL queries. The blog suggests the input should not be escaped in the first place, given it is not needed in the specific scenario.
