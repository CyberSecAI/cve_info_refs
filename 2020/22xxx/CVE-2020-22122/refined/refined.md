```text
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `id` parameter in the `oa.php?c=Staff&a=read` endpoint.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. In the provided example, the attacker extracts the database user.
  - Attack vectors: Sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`oa.php?c=Staff&a=read`) with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker needs to have knowledge of the applicationâ€™s structure. The provided exploit assumes that the attacker has access to the application.
