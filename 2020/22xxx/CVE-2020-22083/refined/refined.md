{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `jsonpickle` library's `decode()` function deserializes untrusted data, leading to remote code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server or application processing the deserialized data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Deserialization of a malicious JSON payload crafted using `jsonpickle.encode()` and passed to the vulnerable `jsonpickle.decode()` function."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create a malicious JSON payload and have it deserialized by the vulnerable application using the `jsonpickle.decode()` function. The attacker needs to inject a malicious JSON payload that when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.  This could be done through a cookie, a POST request, or any other method that passes data to the application.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that jsonpickle uses pickle under the hood. By crafting a malicious json payload, the attacker can cause the underlying pickle library to perform remote code execution. The provided github repo `python-deserialization-attack-payload-generator` can create a malicious payload easily. The versprite blog post goes into detail on the mechanics of how this vulnerability works with the pickle library, and how jsonpickle can be used to create the malicious json payload."
