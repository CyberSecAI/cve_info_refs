Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15196:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing validation in the `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput` operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code fails to verify that the `weights` tensor has the same shape as the data (values) tensor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The lack of shape validation allows an attacker to provide a `weights` tensor with fewer elements than the `values` tensor. This can cause a read out-of-bounds during access to `weight_values`, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** The heap buffer overflow could cause the application to crash, potentially leading to denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   An attacker can craft a malicious input by providing a `weights` tensor that does not match the shape of the `values` tensor when using `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput` operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide inputs to the vulnerable TensorFlow operations either directly through code execution or through user inputs processed by the model.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of how `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput` operations are used, including the input parameters.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions up to 2.3.0
*   The fix is included in TensorFlow version 2.3.1
*   The vulnerability is related to, but different from CVE-2020-15201, which has a similar root cause.
*  The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
