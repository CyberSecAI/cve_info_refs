The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15188.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in SOY CMS. The application unserializes data from a form without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization: The primary weakness is the use of `unserialize()` on user-provided data without any restrictions. This allows for the injection of malicious objects that can execute arbitrary code when unserialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can achieve unauthenticated remote code execution on the server by injecting malicious serialized PHP objects. This allows the attacker to potentially take complete control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Inquiry Form: The vulnerability is triggered through the inquiry form feature. An attacker can submit a crafted form that contains a malicious serialized PHP object as part of the `form_value` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized PHP object that can be used to trigger code execution.
- The inquiry form feature needs to be enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in SOY CMS versions prior to 3.0.2.328.
- The fix involves replacing `unserialize()` with `json_decode()` and `serialize()` with `json_encode()`.
- The issue is different from CVE-2020-15182 and CVE-2020-15183 because it doesn't require any authentication and involves different components.
