{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `TemporaryFolder` rule in JUnit4 creates temporary files and directories in the system's temporary directory, which is shared between all users on Unix-like systems. By default, these created files and directories are readable by other users on the same system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A local information disclosure vulnerability where other users on the system could read the content of files created by the JUnit tests if they wrote sensitive data in these files. It does not allow overwriting the content of the files.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with local access to the system can read the files created by JUnit tests.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user on the same Unix-like system where the JUnit tests are executed."

  "affected_versions": "4.7 - 4.13",
  "patched_versions": "4.13.1",
  "workarounds": "Set the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user if unable to patch or using java 1.6 or lower."
