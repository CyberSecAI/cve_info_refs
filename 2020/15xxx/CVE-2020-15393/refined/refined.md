Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15393:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The USB testing driver (`usbtest`) in the Linux kernel fails to deallocate memory allocated for `dev->buf` on disconnect events. Specifically the `kfree(dev->buf)` was missing in `usbtest_disconnect` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The driver allocates memory for `dev->buf` during probe but does not free it when the USB device is disconnected. This leads to an unreferenced memory object reported by kmemleak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (memory exhaustion):  A physically proximate attacker could repeatedly connect and disconnect a USB device, causing the kernel to leak memory. Over time, this can lead to memory exhaustion, making the system unstable or unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical proximity: The attacker needs physical access to the target system to connect a USB device.
- Repeated connection/disconnection: The attacker has to trigger the vulnerability multiple times to cause memory exhaustion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the machine to plug in a USB device.
- No specific privileges needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using FuzzUSB.
- The fix involves adding `kfree(dev->buf)` in the `usbtest_disconnect` function to properly free the allocated memory when the USB device is disconnected.

The vulnerability is present in the usbtest driver when the device is disconnected. When the device disconnects, the resources associated with it should be freed, including the allocated `dev->buf`. Due to the missing `kfree`, this did not happen leading to a memory leak.
