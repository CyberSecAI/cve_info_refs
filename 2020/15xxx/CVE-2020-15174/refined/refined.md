Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15174:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Electron handled top-level navigations initiated from sub-frames (iframes). The `will-navigate` event, designed to allow applications to prevent navigation to unexpected destinations, could be bypassed when a sub-frame performed a top-frame navigation across sites.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Bypass of `will-navigate` event:** The core issue is that the `will-navigate` event, which is intended to provide a mechanism for applications to control navigation, was not triggered when a sub-frame initiated a top-level navigation to a different origin.
- **Lack of proper navigation control:** Applications relying on the `will-navigate` event to control navigation behavior were unable to do so in this scenario, leading to potentially unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unintended navigation:** Malicious or compromised iframes could force a top-level navigation to an arbitrary URL, potentially leading users to phishing sites or other malicious content, bypassing the application's attempts to control navigation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious iframe:** An attacker could inject a malicious iframe into an application.
- **Cross-site top navigation:** The malicious iframe would perform a top-level navigation to a malicious domain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to inject or control iframe content:** The attacker needs the ability to control the content loaded within an iframe in the vulnerable application. This could be achieved by exploiting a separate vulnerability or by including malicious content in a web page loaded by the application.
- **Cross-site interaction:** The attacker needs to navigate the top frame to a different site.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a commit that addresses the vulnerability by wiring the `will-navigate` event up to a navigation throttle. This suggests that the fix ensures that the `will-navigate` event is triggered even for top-level navigations initiated by sub-frames.
- The commit includes a test case that specifically tests the cross-site top-level navigation scenario, demonstrating the vulnerability and the effectiveness of the fix.
- The advisory mentions that sandboxing all iframes using the `sandbox` attribute as a workaround.
