- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The access code for OTP slots on YubiKey 5 NFC is not checked when updating NFC-specific components of the OTP configurations via NDEF updates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper access control on NDEF updates.
    - Lack of access code validation for NFC configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can potentially access configured OTPs and static passwords stored in slots, even if they were not intended to be read over NFC and an access code was set.
    - An attacker can alter the prefix (typically a URI) associated with the OTP, potentially redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    - An attacker can change which OTP slot is presented over NFC, potentially revealing data from a slot not intended for NFC access.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - NFC interface of the YubiKey 5 NFC.
    - Sending specially crafted NDEF messages via USB or NFC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Physical access to a vulnerable YubiKey 5 NFC device.
    - Ability to send NDEF messages to the YubiKey via USB or NFC.
    - No knowledge of the user's access code is required.
