# Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution

Bluetooth technology has amassed its fair share of [diehard stans](https://gizmodo.com/bluetooth-is-good-now-1838635803) over the years, despite some pretty [gnarly bugs](https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/hacking-bluetooth-vulnerability.html) that open devices up to a bevy of bad actors. Now, the organization behind the namesake technology has put out [a statement](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/blurtooth) about the latest threat facing those of us with Bluetooth-enabled devicesâand thereâs no patch in sight.

BLURtooth, as the issueâs been named, was brought to the companyâs attention by researchers from [The Bluetooth Special Interest Group](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/blurtooth), and [confirmed](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/589825) by another group out of Carnegie Mellon. According to the researchers, the protocols that both Android and iOS follow when linking up to another Bluetooth-powered deviceâlike, say, a pair of speakersâcan be effectively hijacked to give an attacker access to any bluetooth-powered app or service on the phone.

The issue is with a protocol called Cross-Transport Key Derivation (or CTKD, for short). When, say, an iPhone is getting ready to pair up with Bluetooth-powered device, CTKDâs role is to set up two separate [authentication keys](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f) for that phone: one for a âBluetooth Low Energyâ device, and one for a device using whatâs known as the âBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rateâ standard. Different devices require different amounts of dataâand battery powerâfrom a phone. Being able to toggle between the standards needed for Bluetooth devices that take a ton of data (like a Chromecast), and those that require a bit less (like a smartwatch) is more efficient. Incidentally, it might also be less secure.

According to the researchers, if a phone supports both of those standards but doesnât require some sort of authentication or permission on the userâs end, a hackery sort whoâs within [Bluetooth range](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/range) can use its CTKD connection to derive its own competing key. With that connection, according to the researchers, this sort of erzatz authentication can also allow bad actors to weaken the encryption that these keys use in the first placeâwhich can open its owner up to more attacks further down the road, or perform âman in the middleâ style attacks that snoop on unprotected data being sent by the phoneâs apps and services.

Thus far, we donât have any examples of BLUR-based exploits happening in the wild. But just to be safe, the Bluetooth Special Interest team [reportedly](https://www.zdnet.com/article/blurtooth-vulnerability-lets-attackers-overwrite-bluetooth-authentication-keys) began notifying device vendors about the threat of these sorts of attacks, saying that those that are worried about a potentially vulnerable connection should use the handy CTKD restrictions that come with Bluetoothâs 5.1. As for Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 devices, well… theyâre just stuck with this massive security loophole for now. For folks working with that mildly outdated tech, Bluetoothâs corporate statement says that the only way to protect yourself is to keep an eye on the environment where youâre pairing your devices together, since any rogue actor would need to be somewhat nearby in order to carry these sorts of shenanigans out.

There are other [small steps](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/589825) you can take if youâre nervous about any Bluetooth snooping, but right now, a patch isnât one of them. And with no publicized patching timeline from any of these players, weâre really being left at the whims of these Bluetooth-powered device vendors and OS operators to do the right thing, and quickly.

## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the *Exploiting Cross-Transport Key Derivation in Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy* (BLURtooth) and the *Security implications of key conversion between BR/EDR and BLE* Vulnerabilities

Researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the University of Oxford, and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, and researchers at Purdue University have independently identified vulnerabilities related to Cross-Transport Key Derivation (CTKD) in implementations supporting pairing and encryption with both Bluetooth BR/EDR and LE in Bluetooth Specifications 4.2 through 5.0. The researches identified that CTKD, when implemented to older versions of the specification, may permit escalation of access between the two transports with non-authenticated encryption keys replacing authenticated keys or weaker encryption keys replacing stronger encryption keys.

*The researchers also identified that CTKD may permit a remote paired device to access some LE services if BR/EDR access is achieved or BR/EDR profiles if LE access is achieved. As this is the intended use of CTKD, these cross-transport procedures are not being considered vulnerabilities by the SIG.*

For this attack to be successful, an attacking device would need to be within wireless range of a vulnerable Bluetooth device supporting both BR/EDR and LE transports that supports CTKD between the transports and permits pairing on either the BR/EDR or LE transport either with no authentication (e.g. JustWorks) or no user-controlled access restrictions on the availability of pairing. If a device spoofing another device’s identity becomes paired or bonded on a transport and CTKD is used to derive a key which then overwrites a pre-existing key of greater strength or that was created using authentication, then access to authenticated services may occur. This may permit a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack between devices previously bonded using authenticated pairing when those peer devices are both vulnerable.

The Bluetooth SIG is recommending that potentially vulnerable implementations introduce the restrictions on Cross-Transport Key Derivation mandated in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 5.1 and later.

The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedies to our member companies and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches.  As always, Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/589825/).

## Devices supporting Bluetooth BR/EDR and LE using CTKD are vulnerable to key overwrite

#### Vulnerability Note VU#589825

Original Release Date: 2020-09-09 | Last Revised: 2021-02-16

---

### Overview

Devices supporting both Bluetooth BR/EDR and LE using Cross-Transport Key Derivation (CTKD) for pairing are vulnerable to key overwrite, which enables an attacker to to gain additional access to profiles or services that are not restricted by reducing the encryption key strength or overwriting an authenticated key with an unauthenticated key. This vulnerability is being referred to as [BLURtooth](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/blurtooth/).

### Description

As detailed in both the Bluetooth Core Specification versions [4.2](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=441541) and [5.0](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=421043), Bluetooth CTKD can be used for pairing by devices that support both Low Energy (BLE) and Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) transport methods, which are known as "dual-mode" devices. CTKD pairing allows the devices to pair once using either transport method while generating both the BR/EDR and LE Long Term Keys (LTK) without needing to pair a second time. Dual-mode devices using CTKD to generate a LTK or Link Key (LK) are able to overwrite the original LTK or LK in cases where that transport was enforcing a higher level of security.

### Impact

Several potential attacks could be performed by exploiting [CVE-2020-15802](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15802), including a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack. The vulnerability is being referred to as BLURtooth and the group of attacks is being referred to as the BLUR attacks. Vulnerable devices must permit a pairing or bonding to proceed transparently with no authentication, or a weak key strength, on at least one of the BR/EDR or LE transports in order to be susceptible to attack. For example, it may be possible to pair with certain devices using [JustWorks](https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/bluetooth-pairing-part-4/) pairing over BR/EDR or LE and overwriting an existing LTK or LK on the other transport. When this results in the reduction of encryption key strength or the overwrite of an authenticated key with an unauthenticated key, an attacker could gain additional access to profiles or services that are not otherwise restricted.

### Solution

The Bluetooth SIG has released [recommendations](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/blurtooth/) for mitigating this issue that include additional conformance tests to ensure that the overwrite of an authenticated key or a key of a given length with an unauthenticated key or a key of reduced length is not permitted in devices supporting Bluetooth Core Specification version 5.1 or greater. They also recommend that potentially vulnerable implementations introduce the restrictions on CTKD mandated in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 5.1 and later. Implementations should disallow overwrite of the LTK or LK for one transport with the LTK or LK derived from the other when this overwrite would result in either a reduction of the key strength of the original bonding or a reduction in the MITM protection of the original bonding (from authenticated to unauthenticated). This may require that the host track the negotiated length and authentication status of the keys in the Bluetooth security database.

The Bluetooth SIG further recommends that devices restrict when they are pairable on either transport to times when user interaction places the device into a pairable mode or when the device has no bonds or existing connections to a paired device. In all cases, it is recommended that devices restrict the duration of pairing mode and overwrite an existing bonding only when devices are explicitly in pairing mode.
