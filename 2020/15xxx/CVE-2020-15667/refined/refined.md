Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15667:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `libmar` library, specifically within the `mar_read.c` file when processing MAR update files. A signed integer is used for a length parameter, which leads to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Overflow:** When parsing the index of a MAR file, the `namelen` variable, a signed integer, is incremented. If `namelen` is `0x7fffffff`, incrementing it results in `0x80000000`, which then gets sign-extended to `0xffffffff80000000` when used in `memcpy`, causing it to read and write beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** A maliciously crafted MAR file can cause a heap overflow, leading to memory corruption.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While difficult to exploit, the memory corruption can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, as the code attempts to read and write out of bounds.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious MAR File:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted MAR update file with a manipulated `namelen` field in the index.
- **Update Mechanism:**  The crafted MAR file would need to be processed through Firefox's update mechanism, specifically by `libmar`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Sign MAR Files:** As noted in the bug report, Firefox's updater requires that MAR files have a valid signature. Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability in a real-world scenario, an attacker would need access to Mozilla's signing key (this is mentioned as a significant mitigating factor). Otherwise, they could only trigger the bug in development or testing environments.
- **Understanding of MAR File Structure**: The attacker needs to understand the MAR file format well enough to manipulate the `namelen` field.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered "low" severity because it is difficult to exploit in a practical way because of the signing requirement and the nature of heap overflows.
- The fix involves changing the length parameter type to an unsigned integer type to prevent sign extension when used in `memcpy`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 80.
