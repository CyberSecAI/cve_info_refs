{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Zyxel CNM SecuManager software contains several undocumented APIs accessible without authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure API access",
      "Lack of authentication",
       "Exposure of sensitive information"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use these APIs to gather sensitive information such as 'access_key_id' and 'secret_access_key', which are used for communication with the cloud service. This can lead to further exploitation of the cloud service and associated data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to the vulnerable APIs on ports 80/tcp and 9673/tcp"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the appliance. No authentication is required to access the vulnerable APIs."
