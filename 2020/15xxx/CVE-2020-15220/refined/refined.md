Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application creating two cookies for the same user session. This allows an attacker to potentially hijack or steal a user's session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Session Fixation:** The core issue is the presence of two cookies for a single session, which leads to session fixation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal a user's session. By capturing or manipulating one of the session cookies, the attacker could impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Cookie Manipulation/Stealing:** The attack would likely involve intercepting or gaining access to one of the user's session cookies. This could happen through various means, including network eavesdropping (man-in-the-middle attacks), cross-site scripting (XSS), or other methods of cookie theft.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Intercept Network Traffic or Access User's Cookies:** The attacker would need to be in a position to capture or manipulate the user's cookies. This could be achieved via a man-in-the-middle attack, or by exploiting vulnerabilities such as XSS to steal the cookies.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2020-15220 and is present in iTop versions prior to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
*   The issue has been fixed in versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
