Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `install_online_preset` function of the KingComposer plugin. This function processes user-supplied data from `kc-online-preset-data` and `kc-online-preset-link` parameters. The issue is that the `kc-online-preset-data` parameter's content is base64 decoded *after* being sanitized with `esc_attr`. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin reflects the base64 decoded content of the `kc-online-preset-data` parameter within a JavaScript context, leading to XSS if the decoded content contains malicious scripts.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** Although `esc_attr` and `esc_url` are used, the base64 decoding bypasses the sanitization process because it happens after the sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** If the victim is a logged-in administrator, the attacker could potentially create a new admin account, redirect the user, or perform other administrative actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker would need to trick a victim into clicking a specially crafted link. This link would send a request to the vulnerable site with the malicious JavaScript payload encoded in base64 within the `kc-online-preset-data` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No specific privileges:** No specific user account on the target site is needed.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to use social engineering to get the victim to click a malicious link or perform an action that triggers the vulnerable code.
*   **Network access**: The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable site

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerable function was not actively used by the plugin but was still accessible through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 2.9.5 and was fixed by removing the vulnerable function entirely.
*   The vulnerability was assigned **CVE-2020-15299** with a CVSS score of 6.1 (medium).
*   The vulnerable plugin had over 100,000 active installations.
