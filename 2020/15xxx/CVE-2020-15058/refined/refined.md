{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The USB network server sends the administrator password in cleartext via UDP broadcast packets to the local network.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information in cleartext",
      "Lack of encryption for network communications",
      "Unnecessary broadcast of administrative credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can retrieve the administrator password and bypass access restrictions to the administrative interface, gaining full control of the device. The attacker could also use the password to access other systems if the password is reused.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker on the local network can passively listen to UDP broadcast traffic to capture the password.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device."
