Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Gradle Enterprise not properly terminating login sessions when a user closes their browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate session management. Specifically, the application fails to invalidate or expire user sessions upon browser closure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with physical access to a user's machine can gain unauthorized access to Gradle Enterprise. This could lead to:
    - Accessing sensitive information.
    - Modifying project configurations.
    - Performing other actions as the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the machine of a logged-in user who has closed their browser.
- **Browser Reopening:** The attacker simply reopens the browser, which then restores the previous session, giving them access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have physical access to the target machine.
- The attacker must act after the user has closed their browser without logging out of the Gradle Enterprise application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Gradle Enterprise versions 2018.5 up to 2020.2.4.
- The fix is to upgrade to Gradle Enterprise version 2020.2.5 or later.
