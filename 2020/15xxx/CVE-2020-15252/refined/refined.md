Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15252:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to access the `ServletContext` through the `$xcontext.request` binding within the XWiki templating API. This allows users with `SCRIPT` rights to access the application server's `ServletContext`, which contains tools for instantiating arbitrary Java objects and invoking methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Object Exposure:** The XWiki templating API was exposing the `ServletContext` through the `$xcontext.request` variable, which should not be accessible to content creators.
*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** This vulnerability is a type of Server-Side Template Injection, where the attacker can inject code into a template to gain access to server-side resources.
*   **Insufficient Sandboxing:** The Velocity SecureUberspector, intended to sandbox the user macro templates, could be bypassed via the exposed `ServletContext`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can use the exposed `ServletContext` to instantiate arbitrary Java objects and invoke methods, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server with the same privileges as the account running XWiki.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could result in full compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Template Manipulation:** An attacker with `SCRIPT` rights can inject malicious code within XWiki templates.
*   **Velocity Templating API:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the `$xcontext.request` or `$request` to access the servlet context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **SCRIPT Rights:** The attacker needs to have `SCRIPT` rights (which are equivalent to `EDIT` rights before XWiki 7.4) to edit wiki content.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is similar to XWIKI-17141, but utilizes `$xcontext.request` instead of `$request`.
*   The vulnerability allows access to the `InstanceManager` through the `ServletContext` which could be used to create arbitrary Java objects like a `ScriptEngineManager` to execute system commands.
*   The issue has been fixed in XWiki versions 11.10.6 and 12.5
*   The vulnerability was reported by the GitHub Security Lab.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a severity rating of "High."
