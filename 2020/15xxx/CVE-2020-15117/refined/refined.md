Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-15117:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Synergy handles the `kMsgHelloBack` packet. Specifically, the client name length field within this packet is not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow:** An attacker can send a `kMsgHelloBack` packet with a client name length field set to `0xffffffff`. This excessively large value leads to an integer overflow.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The Synergy server does not properly validate the client name length field, leading to the overflow issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The integer overflow triggered by the oversized client name length can cause the Synergy server to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. This prevents legitimate users from sharing their mouse and keyboard between computers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** The attacker sends a crafted `kMsgHelloBack` packet over the network to the Synergy server.
- **Specific Packet:** The attack exploits the `kMsgHelloBack` packet type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Synergy server.
- **Synergy Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the Synergy protocol sufficiently to construct a malicious `kMsgHelloBack` packet with the oversized length field.
- **No Authentication Required:** It appears that no prior authentication with the server is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in the upstream version 1.12.0 of Synergy.
- Fedora updates were released to fix this issue in Fedora 32 and 33.
- The bug report mentions a related bug with ID 1858253, also addressing CVE-2020-15117.
- The fix involves validating the client name length to prevent the integer overflow.
