### SMTP: Do not ignore TLS errors

```

This fixes a CVE-2020-15047 (category: CWE-295). Since commit [0083eea5](/pim/trojita/-/commit/0083eea5ed7f3171729a6d6a206a89de7d09a6cf "Untested attempt at sending mails via SMTP")
which added initial, experimental support for SMTP message submission,
we have apparently never implemented proper SSL/TLS error handling, and
the code has ever since just kept silently ignoring any certificate
verification errors.  As a result, Trojita was susceptible to a MITM
attack when sending e-mails. The information leaked include user's
authentication details, including the password, and the content of sent
messages.

Sorry for this :(.

Now, this patch re-enabes proper TLS error handling. It was not possible
to directly re-use our code for TLS key pinning which we are using for
IMAP connections. In the Qt TLS code, the decision to accept or not
accept a TLS connection is a blocking one, so the IMAP code relies upon
the protocol state machine (i.e., another layer) for deciding whether to
use or not to use the just-established TLS connection. Implementing an
equivalent code in the SMTP library would be nice, but this hot-fix has
a priority. As a result, SMTP connections to hosts with, e.g.,
self-signed TLS certs, are no longer possible. Let's hope that this is
not a practical problem with Lets Encrypt anymore.

Thanks to Damian Poddebniak for reporting this bug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=423453#c0)  Damian Poddebniak    2020-06-24 16:13:20 UTC  ``` I have setup an email account, where the server is configured to present valid certificates for both SMTP and IMAP (via Let's Encrypt.)  Now, I exchange the certificate for SMTP to a self-signed certificate and send an email. Trojita does not complain and connects to the SMTP server providing a username and a password via an potentially insecure connection. This is a security issue.  When the IMAP certificate is exchanged to an invalid one, Trojita shows a security warning. Here, everything seems to be fine.  Tested on Trojita 0.7-git in NixOS and Trojita 0.7 in Ubuntu. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=423453#c1)  Jan Kundrát    2020-06-25 08:22:54 UTC  ``` Doh, right. There's a FIXME in the code for this. It has remained unchanged since commit 0083eea5ed, "Untested attempt at sending mails via SMTP". That's May 2009 :(. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=423453#c2)  Jan Kundrát    2020-06-25 10:07:12 UTC  ``` Patch at <https://gerrit.vesnicky.cesnet.cz/r/1035>, and I've requested a CVE for this via the oss-security ML. Thanks a lot for catching this, Damian. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=423453#c3)  Damian Poddebniak    2020-06-25 18:45:54 UTC  ``` Thank you Jan for your very fast response and patch! Can you already tell when this will find its way into a new release? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=423453#c4)  Jan Kundrát    2020-06-25 19:56:52 UTC  ``` Git commit 77ddd5d44f2bf4155d0c9b6f7d05f01713b32d5d by Jan Kundrát.
