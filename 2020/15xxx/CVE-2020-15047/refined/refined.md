Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Trojita email client, when sending emails via SMTP, was not properly validating SSL/TLS certificates. The code silently ignored any certificate verification errors. This issue was present since the initial, experimental implementation of SMTP support.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of TLS certificates during SMTP connections. The software was accepting connections even with invalid or self-signed certificates without warning or user interaction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the client and the SMTP server could intercept and decrypt the communication.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker could steal the user's authentication details, including their username and password, which are transmitted during the SMTP handshake.
*   **Message Content Exposure:** The attacker could also read the content of emails being sent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker needs to be on the network path between the Trojita email client and the SMTP server. This could be achieved by:
    *   Compromising a router.
    *   Being on the same network (e.g., a public Wi-Fi).
    *   Using a malicious DNS server to redirect the traffic to an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the SMTP server.
*   **Malicious Server:** The attacker would need to have control of a server that could impersonate the legitimate SMTP server, presenting a malicious or self-signed TLS certificate.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present since May 2009 due to an oversight during the initial implementation of SMTP functionality.
*   The fix was implemented by re-enabling proper TLS error handling. However, due to the nature of Qt TLS code, it now prevents connecting to SMTP servers with self-signed certificates. This limitation is considered acceptable due to the wide adoption of services like Let's Encrypt.
*   The bug was reported by Damian Poddebniak, and the fix was quickly implemented by Jan Kundr√°t.
*  The commit introducing the fix is 77ddd5d44f2bf4155d0c9b6f7d05f01713b32d5d.
