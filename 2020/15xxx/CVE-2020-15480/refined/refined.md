  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-15480",
    "description": "The `DirectIo32.sys` and `DirectIo64.sys` kernel drivers distributed with the BurnInTest, PerformanceTest and OSForensics applications by PassMark Software expose an IOCTL functionality that allows low-privilege users to read and write arbitrary Model Specific Registers (MSRs). This could lead to arbitrary Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.",
    "affected_products": [
      "BurnInTest",
      "PerformanceTest",
      "OSForensics"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `DirectIo32.sys` and `DirectIo64.sys` kernel drivers expose an IOCTL interface that allows unprivileged user mode programs to read and write arbitrary CPU MSRs.",
    "vulnerability": "The drivers have an IOCTL interface that lacks proper access control, allowing low-privilege users to read and write arbitrary MSRs.",
    "impact": "Arbitrary Ring-0 code execution and privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vector": "A low-privilege user can send crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver to read and write arbitrary MSRs.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have access to an account with low-privileges and the vulnerable driver must be installed and loaded.",
    "more_info": "The vulnerable IOCTLs are `IOCTL_READ_MSR` (0x80112060) and `IOCTL_WRITE_MSR` (0x80112088). Attackers could patch critical MSRs like `IA32_LSTAR` (0xC0000082) or `IA32_SYSENTER_EIP` (0x00000176) to achieve kernel code execution."
