The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15530.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the Steam client installer's process of copying the `SteamService.exe` file. Specifically, the installer creates a user shortcut before copying the service executable to its final location and starting the service. This creates a time window where a local attacker can replace the original service executable with a malicious one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The Steam installation folder (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`) has insecure ACLs, allowing normal users to read, write, and delete files within it.
*   **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerability:**  The installer copies `SteamService.exe` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Steam` after creating user shortcuts, creating a race condition where the attacker can replace the legitimate file.
*   **Unprotected Service Executable:** The `SteamService.exe` in the installation directory can be replaced by normal users.
*   **Service Executed as SYSTEM:** The Steam Client Service executes with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, which results in the malicious executable being executed with elevated privileges upon service start.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can achieve code execution as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, allowing them to gain full control over the system.
*   **Persistence:** The malicious `SteamService.exe` will be executed every time the Steam service is started, which is done automatically on user login by an autostart entry, ensuring persistence.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute any malicious code with system privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target machine.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the file system by replacing the legitimate `SteamService.exe` with a malicious one.
*   **Oplocks:** The attacker uses opportunistic locks (oplocks) to pause the installation process and gain time to replace the service executable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute code on the target machine.
*   **Ability to Create and Monitor Files:** The attacker must be able to create a shortcut to trigger the oplock and monitor the file system for the installer processes.
*   **Ability to Replace Files:** The attacker must have the ability to replace the `SteamService.exe` file within the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin` directory within a small window of time during the installation.
*   **Understanding of Oplocks:** The attacker must have knowledge of oplocks and use a tool to implement them.
