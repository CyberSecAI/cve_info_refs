Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2020-15701:

**Root Cause:**

*   Apport incorrectly parses configuration files, specifically the `apport-ignore.xml` file. The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `mtime` attribute within this XML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unhandled Exception:** Apport does not properly handle exceptions when the `mtime` attribute in `apport-ignore.xml` is specified as a non-numeric string value. The code attempts to convert this value to a float, leading to a `ValueError`.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application lacks proper validation of the `mtime` attribute, allowing the use of arbitrary string values that cannot be converted to a floating-point number.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can cause Apport to crash by providing a crafted `apport-ignore.xml` file with a malformed `mtime` value, thus disrupting the apport service, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attack is achieved by providing a malicious `apport-ignore.xml` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system who can modify or provide the `apport-ignore.xml` file to Apport.
