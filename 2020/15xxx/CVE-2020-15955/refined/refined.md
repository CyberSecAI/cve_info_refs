Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-15955:

**Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2020-15955, describing it as a "StartTLS command injection" vulnerability. The provided information also identifies the specific software, s/qmail, as being vulnerable.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how STARTTLS implementations handle command pipelining. Specifically, an attacker can inject plaintext commands alongside the STARTTLS command within the same TCP segment. The server then interprets these injected commands as if they were part of the encrypted session after the STARTTLS upgrade.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary SMTP commands into the server's command stream before the TLS handshake completes. This is due to the server processing commands received along with the STARTTLS request before the connection is actually encrypted.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Credential theft:** An attacker can inject commands to authenticate with their own account and then store the victim's credentials in an email accessible by the attacker.
*   **Cross-protocol attacks:** The vulnerability can also be used to serve HTTPS content using the mail serverâ€™s certificate.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Meddler-in-the-Middle (MitM) position:** The attack requires an attacker positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between an email client and server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a MitM, capable of modifying TCP connections.
*   The attacker must have valid login credentials for their own account on the same mail server as the victim.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content details a broader range of STARTTLS vulnerabilities discovered by the researchers, beyond the command injection issue. However, it clearly identifies and explains the specific mechanics of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15955 and its impact.
*   The content also notes that the vulnerability was addressed in s/qmail version 4.0.08.
*   The research found this vulnerability is still present in a surprising number of email server implementations despite being known since 2011 and also provides tools and recommendations to identify vulnerable software.
