Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `NumberFilter` class of the `python-django-filter` library. Specifically, the library failed to restrict the size of the exponent when converting numbers provided in exponential notation. This allowed an attacker to input numbers with extremely large exponents (e.g., "1E1001"), leading to excessive memory allocation and computation when converting these values to integers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation
- Improper handling of exponential notation in numeric input
- Potential for arbitrary resource consumption via large integer conversion

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-Service (DoS). By providing malicious input with an extremely large exponent, an attacker can cause the server to allocate excessive memory and CPU resources when attempting to convert the input to an integer, rendering the service unresponsive or unstable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks by sending crafted HTTP requests with maliciously formatted numeric data to endpoints where `NumberFilter` is used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the affected service. No specific authentication is required for the attack itself, but access to endpoints that use the vulnerable `NumberFilter` is necessary. An authenticated user would be required when using this vulnerability in the context of the identified components.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a `MaxValueValidator` to the form field used by `NumberFilter`, limiting the size of the input value. The default limit is set to 1e50.
-  A new method `get_max_validator()` was introduced to allow users to customize the validator or disable it completely.
- The vulnerability was reported by Marcin Waraksa.
- NetApp has stated that no NetApp products are affected by the vulnerability.

The information provided by the Fedora Project lists provides the fix in version 2.4.0 and indicates this is a new upstream version of the library. The github release information confirms the fix and includes the following information about the applied patch:
* Added a `MaxValueValidator` to the form field for `NumberFilter`. 
* The default limit value for the validator is `1e50`.
* The new `NumberFilter.get_max_validator()` allows customising the used validator, and may return `None` to disable the validation entirely.
