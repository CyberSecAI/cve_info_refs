**Vulnerability:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)

**Affected Product:** Jira module "Gantt-Chart for Jira" by Frank Polscheit - Solutions & IT-Consulting

**Affected Versions:** <= 5.5.3

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing privilege check in the API endpoints responsible for reading and updating the module's configuration. These endpoints use the `userKey` variable to identify the user whose configuration is being accessed. However, no validation is performed to ensure that the authenticated user is indeed the owner of the provided `userKey`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Privilege Check:** The core weakness is the absence of proper authorization checks, allowing an authenticated user to manipulate configurations belonging to other users.
*   **Insecure API Endpoint:** The API endpoints for reading and updating configurations are vulnerable because they blindly accept the `userKey` parameter without verifying if the user has the necessary privileges to modify the settings for the specified user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Configuration Access:** An attacker can read the Gantt-Chart module configurations of other users.
*   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification:** An attacker can modify the Gantt-Chart module configurations of other users. This can lead to a number of other attacks like:
    *   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious scripts into configuration fields, an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of other users' sessions when they view their dashboards. This was mentioned in the advisory as a related attack (SYSS-2020-030).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the Jira application server.
*   **API manipulation:** The attacker crafts specific HTTP requests to the API endpoints, manipulating the `userKey` parameter to access the configurations of other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Jira application.
*   **Knowledge of Victim Usernames:** The attacker needs to know the username (or `userKey`) of the target victim, which can be obtained by browsing user profiles.
*   **Understanding of API Endpoints:** The attacker must be able to craft the HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoints to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit involves the following steps:

1.  **Victim Username Acquisition**: Attacker obtains username by browsing user profiles.
2.  **Chart ID Enumeration**: The attacker sends a GET request to `/rest/gantt/1.0/user/properties?userKey=<victim_user_name>` to enumerate the chart IDs associated with the victim user.
3.  **Configuration Retrieval:** Using the discovered chart IDs, the attacker sends a GET request to `/rest/gantt/1.0/user/properties/<chart_id>?userKey=<victim_user_name>` to read the victim's chart configurations.
4.  **Configuration Modification:**  The attacker sends a PUT request to `/jira/rest/gantt/1.0/user/properties/<chart_id>?userKey=<victim_user_name>` with a modified configuration in the request body to overwrite the victim user's settings.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.5.4 of the "Gantt-Chart for Jira" module.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited to deliver Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads through configuration modifications, further highlighting the severity of the issue.
