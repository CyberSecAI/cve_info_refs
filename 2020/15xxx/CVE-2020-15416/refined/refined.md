{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the httpd service listening on TCP port 80 by default.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be network-adjacent and does not require authentication."
