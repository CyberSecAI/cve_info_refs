  "CVE-2020-15206": {
    "Root cause": "Incomplete validation of NodeDefs within the FunctionDefLibrary of a GraphDef in TensorFlow's SavedModel loading process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation when loading a SavedModel, leading to a failure to detect maliciously crafted models."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service through segmentation faults and potential data corruption during model loading, particularly impacting products using tensorflow-serving or inference-as-a-service setups.",
    "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted SavedModel protocol buffer.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to modify or provide a malicious SavedModel file to a system using vulnerable TensorFlow versions."
  }
