Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15231:

**1. Verification:**
The content directly mentions `CVE-2020-15231` and describes a Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability related to JSONP support in `mapfish-print`. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied data in the JSONP callback parameter.  The application's implementation of JSONP allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the callback parameter, leading to XSS.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the JSONP callback parameter.
- **JSONP misuse:** The use of JSONP without adequate security precautions introduced an exploitable attack vector.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session when accessing a vulnerable endpoint.
- **Data theft, session hijacking and defacement:**  Successful XSS attacks could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the application, depending on the attacker's intention and the application's architecture.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **JSONP Parameter Injection:** An attacker would craft a malicious URL to a vulnerable endpoint with a specially crafted `jsonp` parameter containing JavaScript code.
- **Browser-based attack:** The victim's browser would interpret this code, resulting in the execution of the injected script.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and the possibility of XSS via the JSONP parameter.
- **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL with the malicious JavaScript payload in the JSONP parameter.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs a user to visit the malicious URL, typically by tricking the user.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involved removing JSONP support entirely as seen in the commit `89155f2506b9cee822e15ce60ccae390a1419d5e`.
-  The vulnerability was identified through CodeQL analysis.
- The affected versions are any versions before `3.24`.

In summary, CVE-2020-15231 describes a low-severity XSS vulnerability caused by improper JSONP implementation in the `mapfish-print` library. An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript by crafting a malicious URL and tricking users into visiting it. The vulnerability is resolved by removing JSONP support.
