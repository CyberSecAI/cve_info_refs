{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir` method in Google Guava creates temporary directories with overly permissive file permissions (drwxr-xr-x), which allows other users on the same system to potentially access and steal secrets stored within those directories.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default file permissions on temporary directories.",
       "Use of a JDK method not suitable for security-sensitive contexts."
    ],
    "impact": "Local information disclosure and potential privilege escalation if executable code is stored within the temporary directory. Attackers can steal secrets stored in this directory by another user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Co-resident malicious program on the same machine."
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute code on the same machine as the vulnerable application.",
      "Knowledge of the temporary directory location (usually in `/tmp` or similar shared system directories)."
     ],
    "additional_details": "The issue arises because Guava uses a method in the JDK that does not guarantee secure file permissions and fails to check a flag related to successful directory creation. This leads to a race condition that can be exploited. The vulnerability is fixed by using a newer JDK method and also correctly checking the success flag of the file creation."
