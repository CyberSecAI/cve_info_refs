## Description

![@JLLeitschuh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1323708?u=477b44e744c9d63ec1386f1c728195936b42cbe7&v=4&size=48)[JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh)opened [on Sep 8, 2020](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011#issue-696211338)
# IMPORTANT NOTE

**Updating to Guava 30.0 does not fix this security vulnerability**. The method is merely deprecated. There currently exits no fix for this vulnerability.

[#4011 (comment)](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011#issuecomment-765672282)

---

Since the fix for this vulnerability is now disclosed by this commit ([fec0dbc](https://github.com/google/guava/commit/fec0dbc4634006a6162cfd4d0d09c962073ddf40)) and it was closed internally by google as 'Intended Functionality' I figure I'll disclose the vulnerability fully.

## Vulnerability

```
File guavaTempDir = com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir();
System.out.println("Guava Temp Dir: " + guavaTempDir.getName());
runLS(guavaTempDir.getParentFile(), guavaTempDir); // Prints the file permissions -> drwxr-xr-x
File child = new File(guavaTempDir, "guava-child.txt");
child.createNewFile();
runLS(guavaTempDir, child); // Prints the file permissions -> -rw-r--r--
```

On the flip side, when using `java.nio.file.Files`, this creates a directory with the correct file permissions.

```
Path temp = Files.createTempDirectory("random-directory");
System.out.println("Files Temp Dir: " + temp.getFileName());
runLS(temp.toFile().getParentFile(), temp.toFile()); // Prints the file permissions -> drwx------
Path child = temp.resolve("jdk-child.txt");
child.toFile().createNewFile();
runLS(temp.toFile(), child.toFile()); // Prints the file permissions -> -rw-r--r--
```
## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that, the file permissions on the file created by `com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir` allows an attacker running a malicious program co-resident on the same machine can steal secrets stored in this directory. This is because by default on unix-like operating systems the `/temp` directory is shared between all users, so if the correct file permissions aren't set by the directory/file creator, the file becomes readable by all other users on that system.

## Workaround

This vulnerability can be fixed by explicitly setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system property to a "safe" directory when starting the JVM.

## Resolution

The resolution by the Google team was the following:

> The team decided to document the behavior, as well as deprecate the method as other alternatives exist.

This completely makes sense to me, and I think is appropriate. The open question that exists in my mind is whether or not this issue warrants a CVE number issued.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Subject: [CVE-2020-17521]: Apache Groovy Information Disclosure

CVE-2020-17521 Apache Groovy Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 2.0 to 2.4.4.
Apache Groovy versions 2.4.4 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13,
3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1.

Fixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2

Impact:

This vulnerability potentially impacts Unix-like systems, and very old
versions of Mac OSX and Windows. On such OS versions, Groovy may create
temporary directories within the OS temporary directory which is shared
between all users on affected systems. Groovy will create such directories
for internal use when producing Java Stubs (very low impact) or on behalf
of user code via two extension methods[4,5] for creating temporary
directories.
If Groovy user code uses either of these extension methods, and stores
executable code in the resulting temporary directory, then the risk is high,
since this can lead to local privilege escalation. If such Groovy code is
making
use of the temporary directory to store sensitive information, then the
risk is
medium, since such information could be exposed or modified.

When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important
questions to ask:

Is the Groovy code running on a machine with an impacted operating system?
Do other users have access to the machine running the Groovy code?
Does the Groovy code create temporary directories using Groovy's
createTempDir extension methods[4,5]?

If you answer no to any of these questions, you are not affected.
If you answered yes, does the Groovy code write or store executable code
in the temporary directory? If you answer yes, the risk is high, and can
lead to
local privilege escalation. Does the Groovy code write sensitive
information,
like API keys or passwords, into the temporary directory? If you answer yes,
the risk is medium, and information may be exposed or modified.

Description:

Groovy was making use of a method in the JDK which is now flagged as not
suitable for security-sensitive contexts. In addition, Groovy wasn't
checking
a flag related to successful creation of the temporary directory which leads
to a race condition whereby the vulnerability exists[1].

For the fixed versions, Groovy 2.5 and above is now using a newer JDK method
which creates a directory that is only readable by the user running the
Groovy
code. The same is true for the fixed Groovy 2.4 version except if running
on a pre-JDK7 version of the JDK in which case a fallback implementation is
used which now checks for successful creation of the temporary directory.
This eliminates the high-risk scenario involving the race condition whereby
executables or information could be modified, but still leaves the potential
for sensitive information leakage. Groovy 2.4/JDK 6 users are recommended
to use the `java.io.tmpdir` mitigation.

Mitigation:

Setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory
that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability
for all operating systems and all Groovy versions.

Users who cannot easily move to the fixed Groovy versions may wish to
consider using the JDK's Files#createTempDirectory method instead of the
Groovy extension methods.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
