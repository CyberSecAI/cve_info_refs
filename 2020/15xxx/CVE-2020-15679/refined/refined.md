{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the OAuth login flow where an attacker could craft a malicious login URL. By tricking a user into logging in through this crafted URL, the attacker could gain authenticated access using the victim's session.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OAuth session fixation vulnerability where the session could be hijacked by a malicious URL.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, by using a crafted login URL could gain authenticated access as the victim, view session states and potentially disconnect VPN sessions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves social engineering, where an attacker must trick the victim into using a specially crafted malicious URL to log into the VPN.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create a malicious URL and socially engineer a victim into using it. The attacker and victim must also be sharing the same source IP for the attack to be successful."
