Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15930

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of `EMBED` tags within the Joplin desktop application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of sanitization of user-provided HTML, specifically in how `EMBED` tags are processed. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker can potentially gain control of the application, access or modify data, or perform other actions on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious HTML `embed` tag injected into a note within the Joplin application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be able to create or modify a note with a malicious embed tag that the victim then views within the Joplin application. User interaction is required, as the user needs to open the crafted note containing the malicious embed tag. The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of Joplin desktop >= 1.0.190 and < 1.1.7 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.7.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered to be of moderate severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1.
*   **CWE:** The identified weakness is CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ademar Nowasky Junior.
*   The fix involves disallowing `EMBED` tags to prevent XSS.
