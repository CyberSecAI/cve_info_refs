**Fixes issue #**:

N/A

**Description of the changes being introduced by the pull request**:

When rotating the root (say from v2 to v3, then v3 to v4), the reference implementation currently immediately *verifies* signatures on the latest root (say, v4). This will fail when v4 is signed using v3's but not v2's keys. This PR changes the implementation so that signatures on the latest root is *not* immediately verified.

**Please verify and check that the pull request fulfills the following

requirements**:

* The code follows the [Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines#code-style-guidelines)
* Tests have been added for the bug fix or new feature
* Docs have been added for the bug fix or new feature

| Yeah, I should say that someone should triple-check this to make we are not skipping some important security check. But at that point, all we are trying to do is get the latest version number of the root.  Cc [@lukpueh](https://github.com/lukpueh) |

| I guess there might be a problem. Form switching to \_get\_file() from \_get\_metadata\_file(), the root.json we get is not verified. Then, we are checking if the root metadata is changed or not by comparing the next\_version and latest\_version and the latest\_version is extracted from the unverified root.json file. So if the unverified root.json file points that the latest\_version is same as the current\_version, then the root metadata would not be updated even if there is an update available and we would continue using the old root metadata. |

| [@tanishqjasoria](https://github.com/tanishqjasoria) Good observation, but this would be true even if with a signed and verified "latest" root metadata file: attackers who control the repository can always perform a freeze attack (limited by the expiration of the previous root, which could be as long as years). |

Comment in L1152-1154 claims that `self.consistent_snapshot` is set with `_update_metadata()`.

<https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/c75a2b7fe1eaabc88f82a5f0bdfc8bd25cab7ab1/tuf/client/updater.py#L1152-L1154>

Why set it here explicitly? Is the comment above inaccurate?

I somehow missed the call to `_update_metadata` in the top line of below for-loop. It downloads all the root files again using `_get_metadata_file` exactly how it used to fetch `latest_root_metadata_file`, before your patch. That means, all the checks that I listed in my last review are performed eventually.

So I'd say, LGTM! :)

Do you have capacities to add a test that has at least one intermediate root and where the latest root is signed with keys that are not available in the beginning?

On a side-note, I re-read the [relevant part of the spec](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md#the-client-application) and it seems a bit different from what we do here. As per the spec the client downloads root files with incrementing version numbers until the server *404*s. So in the spec there is no initial download of the latest root.

And on another side-note, did you see [@vladimir-v-diaz](https://github.com/vladimir-v-diaz)'s TODO comment in the `refresh`, where \_update\_root\_metadata is called?

<https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/cf6fdec5101fec5e2402dc8d073fa17ace1fc25f/tuf/client/updater.py#L1079-L1082>

| Our spec should also be updated to say: once you have turned on consistent snapshots, you should always also write versioned besides unversioned root metadata files so that outdated clients can updated to your latest root.

Thanks for your update, [@trishankatdatadog](https://github.com/trishankatdatadog). It does look more like the spec now. However, the code does not work yet. [@JustinCappos](https://github.com/JustinCappos), do we have an intern who can take over, i.e. fix the things I noted below and add some tests?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks for the update, [@trishankatdatadog](https://github.com/trishankatdatadog)! This looks sound now. I'd still like to see tests before we merge. [@JustinCappos](https://github.com/JustinCappos), do we have a student you might want to volunteer? If not, I'll add some tests. |

`[Fix failing AppVeyor Python2.7 tests](/lukpueh/tuf/commit/4b2c05b681d452ec0f64470b3b8c6ed0d4a7427b "Fix failing AppVeyor Python2.7 tests

Since #885 the tests in TestUpdater and TestKeyRevocation fail on
Appveyor Python 2.7 builds. After some live debugging, it turns out
that the tests fail due to the extra amount of http requests to
the simple http server (see tests/simple_server.py) that were
added in #885.

The simple server runs in a subprocess and is re-used for the
entire TestCase. After a certain amount of requests it becomes
unresponsive. Note that neither the subprocess exits (ps -W), nor
does the port get closed (netstat -a). It just doesn't serve the
request, making it time out and fail the test.

The following script can be used to reproduce the issue (run in
tests directory):

```python
import subprocess
import requests
import random

counter = 0

port = random.randint(30000, 45000)
command = ['python', 'simple_server.py', str(port)]
server_process = subprocess.Popen(command, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
url = 'http://localhost:'+str(port) + '/'

sess = requests.Session()

try:
  while True:
    sess.get(url, timeout=3)
    counter +=1

finally:
  print(counter)
  server_process.kill()
```

It fails repeatedly on the 69th request, but only if
`stderr=subprocess.PIPE` is passed to Popen. Given that for each
request the simple server writes about ~60 characters to stderr,
e.g.

```
127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2020 12:01:23] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -
```
... it looks a lot like a full pipe buffer of size 4096. Note that the
`bufsize` argument to Popen does not change anything.

As a simple work around we silence the test server on
Windows/Python2 to not fill the buffer.")`

port = random.randint(30000, 45000)
command = ['python', 'simple_server.py', str(port)]
server_process = subprocess.Popen(command, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
url = 'http://localhost:'+str(port) + '/'

sess = requests.Session()

try:
  while True:
    sess.get(url, timeout=3)
    counter +=1

finally:
  print(counter)
  server_process.kill()
```

It fails repeatedly on the 69th request, but only if
`stderr=subprocess.PIPE` is passed to Popen. Given that for each
request the simple server writes about ~60 characters to stderr,
e.g. ...
```
127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2020 12:01:23] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
... it looks a lot like a full pipe buffer of size 4096. Note that the
`bufsize` argument to Popen does not change anything.

As a simple work around we silence the test server on
Windows/Python2 to not fill the buffer.

# Invalid root may become trusted root

Moderate

## Package

pip

tuf
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.12

## Patched versions

0.12

## Description

### Impact

The Python TUF reference implementation `tuf<0.12` will incorrectly trust a previously downloaded root metadata file which failed verification at download time. This allows an attacker who is able to serve multiple new versions of root metadata (i.e. by a man-in-the-middle attack) culminating in a version which has not been correctly signed to control the trust chain for future updates.

While investigating the reported vulnerability, we discovered that the detailed client workflow was not fully implemented. Specifically, for step 1.3 the newly downloaded root metadata was not being verified with a threshold of keys specified in the new root metadata file.

This missing step of the client workflow has been implemented in [PR #1101](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/1101), which is included in [v0.14.0](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.14.0) of tuf.

### Patches

A [fix](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/885), is available in version [0.12](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.12.0) and newer.

### Workarounds

No workarounds are known for this issue.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15163

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

### @joshuagl **[joshuagl](/joshuagl)** commented [Aug 6, 2020](#issue-674220347)

**Fixes issue #**: N/A

**Description of the changes being introduced by the pull request**:

The updater was not adhering to the detailed client workflow. Specifically newly downloaded root metadata was not being verified with a threshold of signatures from itself.

Per the detailed client workflow in the specification step 1.2

> Version N+1 of the root metadata file MUST have been signed by:
>
> (1) a threshold of keys specified in the trusted root metadata file (version N), and
>
> (2) a threshold of keys specified in the new root metadata file being validated (version N+1)."

This PR ensures that point two is verified by the updater.

**Please verify and check that the pull request fulfills the following

requirements**:

* The code follows the [Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines#code-style-guidelines)
* Tests have been added for the bug fix or new feature
* Docs have been added for the bug fix or new feature

Should we bail on a single exception here? Feels like we need a try-catch...

`_get_metadata_file` has some logic to collect all exceptions and pack them into `NoWorkingMirrorError`, so I *think* this just continues the existing pattern?

I also wouldn't call this function inside \_verify\_metadata\_file(), because there is too much magic. Best to call it explicitly in the \_update\_root\_metadata() code IMHO.

Agreed, this does make `_verify_metadata_file()` much more magical. I opted to call it inside `_verify_metadata_file()` because this enable us to perform the check before the tempfile is persisted, and makes it easier to perform the check per download mirror.

If we do the check in `_update_root_metadata()` we need to clean up a file from the clients metadata directory and, perhaps less importantly, can only perform the check on a single file returned by `_update_root_metadata()`

Sorry, something went wrong.

+1. I think the point of never writing unverified files is *critical* and should probably be encoded in comments or docs... If we do not adhere to that it's almost impossible to ensure that our state of metadata stays valid.

Also, we want to make sure that other functions that depend on this function do the same thing. Let's leave the magic alone for now, but document clearly why it is there, and not somewhere else.

Lovely test, but there's some overlap between this test and the next. Maybe clarify that there is at least one successful intermediate rotation involved or something.
