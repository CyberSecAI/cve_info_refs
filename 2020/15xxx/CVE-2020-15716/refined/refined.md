Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2020-15716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and encoding of user-supplied input within the RosarioSIS Student Information System. Specifically, the application directly incorporates parameters like 'tab', 'include_inactive', and 'advanced' from GET requests into HTML output without sufficient validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the URL parameters is reflected back to the user's browser, where it is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, gaining unauthorized access to the victim's account.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the website.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site, or create fake login forms to capture user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **GET Request Parameters:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs with JavaScript payloads embedded in the `tab`, `include_inactive`, and `advanced` parameters.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted URL to a victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking on the malicious link. This could be done via social engineering, email phishing, or any other method that entices the user to load the crafted URL in their browser.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Files:** The vulnerability is found in `modules/Users/Preferences.php`, `modules/Scheduling/PrintSchedules.php`, and `modules/Users/Search.inc.php`.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability exists in RosarioSIS versions prior to 6.7.2.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided content includes PoC URLs demonstrating the XSS vulnerability in the aforementioned files using different parameters and payloads (including redirect and `alert()` examples).
*   **Remediation:** The content includes a code diff showing that `htmlspecialchars()` and `strip_tags()` are implemented to sanitize the input value of the 'tab' parameter.
*   **CVSS Score:**  CVSS v3.1 is rated as AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Issue Tracking:** The GitLab issue [#291](https://gitlab.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis/-/issues/291) corresponds to this vulnerability.
