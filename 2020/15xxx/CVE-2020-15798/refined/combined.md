SUMMARY

SINAMICS medium voltage products, with telnet enabled on SIMATIC comfort HMI Panels, are affected
by a remote access vulnerability that could allow an attacker, under certain conditions, to gain full remote
access to the HMI. Note that by default telnet is disabled, but it can be enabled by the system integrator
on request.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products, and recommends to update them to the latest
version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Follow SINAMICS MV Industrial Security guidelines

• Disable telnet on the HMI Panels if enabled. If this is not possible, Defense-in-Depth should be
used. Note: By default telnet is disabled, but it can be enabled by the system integrator on request.

• For any questions regarding update, please contact Siemens customer service or your system

integrator.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

The SINAMICS medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety of medium voltage
converters or inverters in different applications.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15798

Affected devices with enabled telnet service do not require authentication for this service. This could
allow a remote attacker to gain full access to the device. (ZDI-CAN-12046)
