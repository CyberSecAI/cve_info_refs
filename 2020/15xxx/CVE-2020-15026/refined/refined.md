The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15026.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `$file` parameter in the backup plugin is not filtered, leading to arbitrary file downloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file download vulnerability due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download any file from the server by manipulating the `$file` parameter in the backup plugin. This can expose sensitive data, including configuration files, databases, or source code.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious request to the backup plugin with a manipulated `$file` parameter, an attacker can force the server to download an arbitrary file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the backup plugin functionality with the ability to manipulate the file parameter.
