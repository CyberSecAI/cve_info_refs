Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way the Envoy shutdown process was implemented in older versions of Contour.
- A GET request to `/shutdown` on port `8090` of the Envoy pod would initiate Envoy's shutdown sequence.
- The shutdown process includes flipping the readiness endpoint to false, which removes Envoy from the routing pool.
- The `/shutdown` endpoint was accessible to anyone on the network that could reach the Kubernetes node running Envoy when Envoy was run with host networking. There was no authentication in place to restrict access to this endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Authentication:** The shutdown endpoint on Envoy was publicly accessible within the network, lacking any form of authentication or authorization.
- **Exposed Shutdown Endpoint:** The shutdown endpoint was directly exposed to the network, allowing unauthorized users to trigger the shutdown process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability to shut down all instances of Envoy.
- **Ingress Data Plane Failure:** Shutting down all Envoy instances would effectively kill the entire ingress data plane, disrupting the normal flow of traffic to applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Kubernetes node running the Envoy pod.
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a GET request to the `/shutdown` endpoint on port `8090`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the Kubernetes node where Envoy is running, specifically on port 8090.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Fix Details:**

- **PreStop Hook Change:** The preStop lifecycle hook now uses a command instead of an HTTP request to trigger Envoy shutdown sequence.
- **Shutdown Endpoint Modification:** The `/shutdown` HTTP endpoint now only returns when the pod is ready to be terminated and no longer initiates the Envoy shutdown sequence.
- **File Messaging Pattern:** The shutdown manager now uses a file messaging pattern to determine when it's safe to terminate Envoy. It checks for the existence of a file in the filesystem.
