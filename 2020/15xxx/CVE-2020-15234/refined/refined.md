Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15234:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of redirect URIs in the OAuth 2.0 flow. Specifically, the comparison between the registered redirect URI and the requested redirect URI was done using `strings.ToLower`, which ignores character casing differences. Also, the query string was not being compared.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Case-insensitive comparison:** The use of `strings.ToLower` for redirect URI matching allowed a client to use a redirect URI with different casing than what was registered.
- **Query String mismatch:** The redirect URI comparison did not check if the query string was equal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **OAuth 2.0 Bypass:** An attacker could register a client with one redirect URI (e.g., `https://example.com/callback`) and then, during the OAuth 2.0 flow, use a redirect URI with a different casing (e.g., `https://example.com/CALLBACK`) or query string (`https://example.com/callback?bar=foo`). This could potentially lead to a successful OAuth2 response being sent to a different redirect URL than intended by the client.
- **Data Exposure:** Depending on the overall OAuth2 flow, the attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from the authorization server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack occurs during the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.
- An attacker registers a client with a specific redirect URI.
- During an OAuth 2.0 flow, the attacker provides a redirect URI with a different casing or query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to register a client application with the OAuth 2.0 authorization server.
- The attacker must be able to initiate an OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.
- The attacker does not need any special access or privileges on the target system, other than those already given to clients.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a commit that addresses the issue by removing the `strings.ToLower` call and comparing the URIs with a simple string match. The commit also checks for equality of the query string and adds tests to prevent future regressions.
- The vulnerability was present in `github.com/ory/fosite` versions <= v0.34.0. The fix is included in v0.34.1.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
- The commit diffs highlight the specific changes made to the `authorize_helper.go` and `authorize_helper_test.go` files to fix the issue.
