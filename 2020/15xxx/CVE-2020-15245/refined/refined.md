Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Sylius e-commerce platform's handling of customer email address changes. When a user changed their email address on the account details page, the system did not invalidate the existing email verification status. This allowed a user to change their email to a different address while remaining verified and enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Email Change Handling:** The system failed to re-verify the user's email address after it was changed. The existing verification status was not revoked.
- **Lack of Email Verification on Change:** The email verification process was not triggered when the customer's email was updated, which is a crucial step in maintaining the integrity of the user's account.
- **Synchronization Issue**: The customer email and the user's username were not properly synchronized and validated during the update process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking (Indirect):** While not directly taking over existing accounts, the vulnerability allowed users to associate their verified account with a completely different email address. This could potentially lead to confusion, unexpected communications to the new email address, and other forms of indirect account manipulation.
- **Misrepresentation:** An attacker could potentially change the email address associated with a verified account to misrepresent the account holder's identity.
- **Bypass Security Measures:** The primary impact was that the "verified" status of an account did not necessarily correspond to the current email address.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Account Modification:** An attacker, in control of a legitimate user account, could navigate to the account details page and change the associated email address to one they control, while retaining their verified status.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on a Sylius-based e-commerce shop.
- **Access to Account Settings:** The attacker needs the ability to access and modify their account settings, specifically the email address.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit diff shows the fix for this issue. It introduces logic in `CustomerEmailUpdaterListener.php` to reset the `verifiedAt` status and generate a new verification token when a customer's email address is changed. It also disables the user's account if email verification is required by the channel.
