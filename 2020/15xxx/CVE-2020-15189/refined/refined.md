Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-15189:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an **insecure configuration in elFinder**, a file manager used by SOY CMS. Specifically, the file upload functionality did not properly validate file types, allowing for the upload of malicious PHP files. The `uploadDeny` and `uploadAllow` settings were insufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper file type validation, allowing an attacker to upload files with arbitrary extensions (e.g., PHP files) despite configured MIME type restrictions.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Chaining Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability can be chained with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2020-15183) to increase the impact by redirecting the administrator to access a specially crafted page, thereby leading to RCE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, allowing an attacker to gain full control of the server and potentially the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the file manager functionality, where an attacker uploads a PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the SOY CMS admin panel and needs to be a logged-in administrator.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in SOY CMS versions 3.0.2 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is located within the `cms/soycms/js/elfinder/php/connector.php` file.
*   The fix involves adding a file extension check within the `accessControl` section, specifically blocking the upload of PHP files.
*   The issue is tracked as issue #9 and resolved by PR #14.
*   The vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2020-15182 and CVE-2020-15183.
