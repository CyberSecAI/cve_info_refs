# Twig Sandbox Escape by authenticated users with access to editing CMS templates when safemode is enabled.

Moderate

[LukeTowers](/LukeTowers)
published
GHSA-94vp-rmqv-5875
Nov 22, 2020

## Package

composer

october/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.319, < 1.0.469

## Patched versions

1.0.469

## Description

### Impact

An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP.

This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP.

### Patches

Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.

### Workarounds

Apply [106daa2...7cb148c](https://github.com/octobercms/october/compare/106daa2930de4cebb18732732d47d4056f01dd5b...7cb148c1677373ac30ccfd3069d18098e403e1ca) to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 469.
