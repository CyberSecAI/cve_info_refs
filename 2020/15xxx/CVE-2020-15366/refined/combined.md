**What problem do you want to solve?**

[#182 (comment)](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/182#issuecomment-219548557)

**What do you think is the correct solution to problem?**

Option changing type validation. Check if these values are coercible to strings - with this option coercion should fail too

**Will you be able to implement it?**

Maybe
