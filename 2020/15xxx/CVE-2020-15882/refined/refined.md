Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application does not correctly check the CSRF token when requests are made via any HTTP method other than POST or DELETE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Bypass:** A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists, where the application fails to validate CSRF tokens for HTTP methods other than POST or DELETE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick an authenticated user into submitting malicious requests that the web application trusts.
- This can lead to unauthorized actions, such as:
    - Inadvertent client or server data leakage.
    - Changes in session state.
    - Manipulation of an end user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves tricking a user into making a request through methods like GET, PUT, etc. where CSRF token validation is missing.
- This can be done by embedding malicious links or forms in an attacker-controlled website or through other social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to visit a malicious web page or click a malicious link that sends a crafted request to the vulnerable MunkiReport instance.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the MunkiReport instance, but they need a logged-in user to trigger the request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects MunkiReport versions 2.5.3 through 5.6.2.
- The fix involves updating to a patched version of MunkiReport.
