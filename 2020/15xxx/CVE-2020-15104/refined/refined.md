{
  "CVE-2020-15104": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Envoy incorrectly allowed a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name to apply to multiple subdomains, violating RFC 6125.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect wildcard matching logic in TLS certificate validation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack by obtaining a valid wildcard certificate for a higher-level domain and impersonating services on subdomains that were intended to be trusted independently.",
      "Attack vectors": "Attacker obtains a wildcard TLS certificate for a domain, and then uses it to impersonate a service on a subdomain which would normally not be covered by the cert.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to obtain a signed wildcard certificate for a domain or subdomain that a target service trusts, but intends to only trust a subdomain."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of wildcard characters in the subject alternative name (SAN) field of TLS certificates.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Envoy incorrectly allowed a wildcard SAN to match subdomains beyond the first level, violating the intended behavior defined by RFC 6125.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a wildcard certificate for a higher-level domain to impersonate a service on a lower level subdomain, thereby bypassing intended security controls and potentially intercepting communication.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves the use of a maliciously obtained or misused wildcard certificate where the client incorrectly allows the wildcard to match deeper subdomain levels than intended. This could happen during the mTLS handshake or when validating the server certificate of an upstream connection.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must possess a valid wildcard certificate for a domain that the victim trusts to some extent, but they need to impersonate services for more specific subdomains that should not be covered by the same certificate."
