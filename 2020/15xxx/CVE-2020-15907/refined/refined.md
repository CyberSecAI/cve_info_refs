Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The file browser in Mahara does not properly escape file and folder names, allowing JavaScript code to be embedded within them.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization of file/folder names.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Embedded JavaScript code within file or folder names can be executed in the context of a user's browser session when the file/folder is accessed or displayed. This can lead to malicious actions, such as:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Redirection to malicious sites
        *   Data theft
        *   Defacement of pages
    * The injected script is executed in multiple contexts, specifically:
        * When viewing a folder with a malicious name in the file browser.
        * When an image or file with a malicious name is selected for use on a page.
        * When editing a block containing the malicious image/file.
        * When a folder block with a malicious folder name is added to a page.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can upload a file or create a folder with a malicious name containing JavaScript code.
    *   The malicious code is triggered when a user interacts with the file/folder within the file browser interface or displays them on pages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a user able to create or upload files and folders in Mahara.

**Versions Affected:**
* Mahara 19.04 before 19.04.6
* Mahara 19.10 before 19.10.4
* Mahara 20.04 before 20.04.1

This vulnerability affects multiple areas within Mahara, including groups, institutions, and site areas that use the same JavaScript files for the file browser.
