The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15325.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ejabberd service uses a hardcoded certificate and private key. Additionally, the management webservice for Ejabberd is reachable on the WAN interface, and uses hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded certificate and private key for Ejabberd.
- Hardcoded credentials for the Ejabberd management interface (a1@chopin / cloud1234).
- The configuration file containing these credentials has world-readable permissions.
- The shared secret for ejabberd replication (Erlang cookie) is also hardcoded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can:
- Use the hardcoded certificate and key to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the communication between the CNM SecuManager and the connected CPEs.
- Access the Ejabberd management interface and control connected CPEs using the hardcoded credentials and create havoc by listing/removing connected CPEs.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks using the hardcoded certificate and key.
- Direct access to the management web interface on port 5280/tcp on the WAN, using the hardcoded credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs network access to the target device to perform MITM attacks.
- An attacker needs network access to port 5280/tcp on the WAN to directly access the management web interface.
