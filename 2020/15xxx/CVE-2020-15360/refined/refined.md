        "DATA": {
          "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `com.docker.vmnetd` launch service, which runs at root authority, communicates with the client (Docker) through a local socket without verifying the client during the communication process.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of client verification during communication, allowing for privilege escalation.",
          "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain elevated permissions by communicating with the `com.docker.vmnetd` service without proper authentication.",
           "Attack vectors": "Communicating with the local socket of the `com.docker.vmnetd` service using a malicious client.",
          "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to communicate with the local socket."
