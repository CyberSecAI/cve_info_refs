  "CVE-2020-15651": {
    "description": "A unicode RTL order character in the downloaded file name can be used to change the file's name during the download UI flow to change the file extension.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the browser's failure to correctly parse and handle Right-to-Left Override (RTLO) unicode characters in filenames during the download process.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The browser fails to sanitize or remove RTLO characters from filenames, causing a visual misrepresentation of the actual file extension.",
      "The download UI displays the modified file name including RTLO characters, potentially misleading the user about the file type."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor can trick a user into downloading and executing a file with a misleading extension. For example, an executable file could be disguised with a .jpg extension to trick the user into thinking it's an image.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious website that presents a file for download with a crafted filename containing the RTLO character."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the filename of a downloadable file."
  },
    "CVE-2020-15661": {
    "description": "A rogue webpage could override the injected WKUserScript used by the logins autofill, this exploit could result in leaking a password for the current domain.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the timing of the injection of the LoginsHelper.js script by the browser. This script is injected at 'AtDocumentEnd', which allows a malicious script injected earlier in the page lifecycle to define and override the LoginsHelper object before the legitimate script is injected.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "The LoginsHelper object, responsible for managing user logins, can be overwritten by an attacker's script due to the injection timing.",
       "Injected scripts can define an immutable LoginsHelper object to prevent the legitimate script from setting the correct object."
      ],
    "impact": "An attacker can steal user credentials (usernames and passwords) by injecting a malicious script that captures login data when autofill is used.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious website injecting a script to override the LoginsHelper object.",
        "Malicious ads served within legitimate pages containing the exploit code."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to inject a malicious script into a webpage, typically through a malicious advertisement or by controlling the website's content."
