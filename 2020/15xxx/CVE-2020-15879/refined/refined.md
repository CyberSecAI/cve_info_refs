The provided content is related to a fix for CVE-2020-15879.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `IsInternal` function, used to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, was missing some internal IP ranges, including IPv6 ranges. This allowed requests to be made to internal services that should have been blocked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Insufficient input validation, specifically, an incomplete list of internal IP ranges being checked by the `IsInternal` function. This leads to SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to make requests to internal services, potentially accessing sensitive information or causing other damage. This is a typical SSRF scenario.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to control the target IP address and the vulnerable application to make requests to internal services.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be internal, but the target of the attack must be an internal service.
