The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-15303.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Infoblox NIOS application allows users to import authentication service configurations by parsing an XML file without prior validation of the fileâ€™s content. This lack of validation allows a malicious user to upload an XML file containing calls to recursive entities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability due to missing XML validation.
- Lack of input validation for XML files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. The server becomes delayed while parsing the malicious XML content, rendering the service unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the upload of a specially crafted XML file by a privileged user during the import of SAML authentication service configurations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a privileged user with the ability to import authentication service configurations in the NIOS application.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload an XML file, which can be done through the application's interface.
