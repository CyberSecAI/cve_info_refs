Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The etcd gateway, which acts as a TCP proxy for service discovery and access, can be configured to include its own address as an endpoint. This creates a loop where the gateway continuously requests itself, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation in the gateway configuration, allowing the inclusion of its own address as an endpoint.
- Susceptibility to a recursive loop when misconfigured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The gateway becomes unresponsive due to resource exhaustion, specifically the depletion of file descriptors available for accepting new connections.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  By misconfiguring the etcd gateway to include its own address as a valid endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to configure the etcd gateway, such as by modifying the configuration files or providing specific command-line arguments during setup.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects etcd versions <= 3.4.9.
*   Patched versions are 3.4.10 and 3.3.23.
*   The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
*   The vulnerability was privately disclosed
*   The fix was released within 1-21 days of disclosure
