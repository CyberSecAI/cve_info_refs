Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-15171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability of users with SCRIPT rights to access the application server's Servlet context. This context contains tools that allow instantiation of arbitrary Java objects and invocation of methods, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Access Control:** Users with SCRIPT rights (or EDIT rights before XWiki 7.4) have excessive privileges. This allows them to access the Servlet context which should be restricted.
- **Arbitrary Object Instantiation:** The vulnerability allows attackers to create arbitrary Java objects using tools available in the Servlet context.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By instantiating and invoking methods on these arbitrary objects, attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the application server. This can result in complete compromise of the server and the application running on it.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
- **System Takeover:** The attacker could potentially take control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the XWiki platform's web interface, leveraging the access granted by the SCRIPT right.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a user with the SCRIPT right (or EDIT right before XWiki 7.4) within the XWiki platform.
- **Web Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki platform to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by the GitHub Security Lab under #GHSL-2020-046.
- Patches were released in XWiki versions 11.10.5 and 12.2.1.
- The recommended workaround is to restrict SCRIPT rights to only trusted users.
- There are no associated CWEs listed for this CVE.
