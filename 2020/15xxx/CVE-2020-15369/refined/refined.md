- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Supportlink CLI in Brocade Fabric OS versions v8.2.1 through v8.2.1d, and 8.2.2 versions before v8.2.2c does not obfuscate the password field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Password exposure due to lack of obfuscation in the Supportlink CLI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user could obtain the exposed password credentials to gain access to the remote host. This could lead to unauthorized access to the remote server.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user can observe the exposed password field when using the Supportlink CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Brocade Fabric OS.
