Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Immuta application has a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `Projects → Datasources → Comments` section.
*   Additionally, a DOM-based XSS vulnerability exists on the login page due to how the application handles certain URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:**  A low-privileged user can inject malicious JavaScript code into data source comments, which is then executed when other users view those comments.
*   **DOM-based XSS:**  The login page processes URL parameters unsafely, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of the application's origin, both for unauthenticated and authenticated users.
*   **Content Injection:** The application does not sanitize project names, allowing for arbitrary HTML injection, which can be used for phishing attacks.
*  **Insufficient Authorization Controls:** The application allows users to change their password without confirming their current password.
*   **Improper Session Management:** Session tokens are not invalidated upon user logout, making them valid until expiration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Attackers can escalate privileges, hijack user accounts, and perform actions on behalf of authenticated users, including changing passwords.
*   **DOM-based XSS:** Attackers can phish credentials during the authentication process, or if the user is authenticated, force actions on behalf of authenticated users.
*   **Content Injection:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites, potentially leading to credential theft.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Controls:**  Attackers with temporary access can gain persistent access to an account, denying access to the legitimate owner. This can also be combined with other vulnerabilities, such as the XSS issue, to compromise accounts.
*  **Improper Session Management:** If a session token is leaked, the user cannot invalidate the session by logging out, leaving the session vulnerable until it expires.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** A low-privileged user injects malicious script into data source comments. Other users with access to the comment will trigger the XSS when viewing the comment.
*   **DOM-based XSS:** Attackers craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `userid` parameter, which, when visited, executes the malicious script in the victim's browser.
*   **Content Injection:** A user can inject HTML content into the project name field which is then rendered as part of the application.
*  **Insufficient Authorization Controls:** An attacker can directly make an API request to change a user's password without knowing their current one.
*   **Improper Session Management:** An attacker who gains access to a session token, for example, through XSS, can use that token even after the user has logged out of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker requires a low-privileged user account with the ability to create projects and data sources within the application.
*   **DOM-based XSS:** No authentication is required for the initial attack. The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted link to a victim user.
*   **Content Injection:** An attacker needs an account with the ability to create projects.
*  **Insufficient Authorization Controls:** The attacker needs to be able to make authenticated requests on behalf of the targeted user. This can be obtained through malicious means like the other vulnerabilities in the advisory.
*   **Improper Session Management:** The attacker needs to gain access to a valid session token.

**Additional Information**

*   The advisory mentions that Immuta has patched these vulnerabilities in version 2020.2.2 and later, using a revised naming convention.
*   The advisory mentions CVE-2020-15951, CVE-2020-15949, and CVE-2020-15950, which are related to the other vulnerabilities found (Content injection, Insufficient authorization controls, and Improper Session Management respectively).
* The XSS, content injection, insufficient authorization control and improper session management vulnerabilities were discovered by Bishop Fox.
