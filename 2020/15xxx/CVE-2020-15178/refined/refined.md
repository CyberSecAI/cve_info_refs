Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the contact form module not properly sanitizing user-supplied message data before using it to construct email content. Specifically, the module was using `html_entity_decode` on the message retrieved from the `Tools::getValue('message')` which results in unescaped message data, and this was later used in an email template through `Tools::nl2br()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS (CWE-79). By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the message field of the contact form, an attacker could have this code stored and then executed in the context of other users who viewed the email sent through the contact form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code which will execute in the context of the user who views the email.
*   This can lead to malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacing pages, redirecting users to other sites, or extracting sensitive information.
*   The provided information notes a low severity which could indicate the impact would not compromise critical systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the contact form available in PrestaShop.
*   An attacker would need to submit a crafted message containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker does not need any special privileges and can use the publicly accessible contact form.
*   The attacker only needs to be able to submit the contact form with malicious content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the `contactform` module up to `v1.0.1`.
*   The fix for the vulnerability was introduced in version `v4.3.0`.
*   The fix involved changing `html_entity_decode` to `Tools::htmlentitiesUTF8` during email construction.
*   The provided commit diff shows that the fix consists of replacing `'{message}' => Tools::nl2br(Tools::stripslashes($message))` with `'{message}' => Tools::nl2br(Tools::htmlentitiesUTF8(Tools::stripslashes($message)))` in the `sendMessage` function of `contactform.php`.
