# Stored XSS vulnerability when rendering data

Moderate

[JoeGermuska](/JoeGermuska)
published
GHSA-2jpm-827p-j44g
Jul 9, 2020

## Package

npm

timelinejs3
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 3.7.0

## Patched versions

3.7.0

## Description

### Impact

TimelineJS renders some user data as HTML. An attacker could implement an XSS exploit with maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields. This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file.

Most TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document.

Some TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised.

Although the vulnerability has a [CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.2](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), this vulnerability has a severity of Moderate due to the likeliness of exploitation.

### Patches

Version 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways.

1. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content is "sanitized" before being added to the DOM.
2. For content intended for simple text display, all markup is stripped.

Very few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users will automatically begin using the new code**. The only exception would be users who have deliberately edited the embed URL to "pin" their timeline to an earlier version of the code.

Some users of TimelineJS use it as a part of a [wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/knight-lab-timelinejs/). Version 3.7.0.0 of that plugin and newer integrate the updated code. Users are encouraged to update the plugin rather than manually update the embedded version of TimelineJS.

### Workarounds

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have write access to the data source for the Timeline or the server which embeds the timeline.

Thus, the only workaround is appropriate attention to securing write access to the Google Sheet or JSON file which serves as the data source.

### References

For more about the release of TimelineJS which addresses this vulnerability, see the [Knight Lab website](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2020/07/09/timelinejs-update/index.html).

A technical write-up of this vulnerability is available [here](https://zanderwork.com/blog/cve-2020-15092/).

  A big change is coming to StoryMapJS, and it will affect many, if not most existing storymaps. When making a storymap, one way to set a style and tone for your project is to set the âmap type,â also known as the âbasemap.â When we launched StoryMapJS, it included options for a few basemaps created by Stamen Design. These included the âwatercolorâ style, as well as the default style for new storymaps, âToner Lite.â Stamen...

  As streaming develops into the latest age of entertainment, how are interfaces and layouts being designed to prioritize user experienceÂ and accessibility? The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated streaming services becoming the dominant form of entertainment.

  Knight Labâs seriesÂ on product thinking in media started with a question: âJournalism Has Been Disrupted. Can Product Thinking Save It?â Â After more than 25 years in digital publishing—and as the editor for the series—I think the answer is âYes.â In fact, I would go further. Â Product thinking is the most important mindset for media companies to embrace today. Â For news organizations, especially, product thinking is the best wayâor only wayâto ensure that you are reaching...

  As digital media companies become tech companies, their need for people with technical backgrounds grows, creating opportunities for software developers interested in journalism and media. âI encourage technologists, product managers, project managers and anyone from outside the industry to come to the news because we need you, and your democracy needs you,â said Brian Boyer, former vice president of product and people at Spirited Media. Twelve years ago, Boyer left a career as a software...

  In the last 25 years, media organizations have had to evolve from one-product businesses into multi-product, technology-enabled companies. This evolution was born out of necessity, ushering in a new era that requires âproduct thinkingâ and the emergence of a new discipline: news product management. The first conferenceÂ for product thinkers in journalism was held in February in Philadelphia, attracting 225 attendees, and over 500 people signed up for emails about the event. The event led, in...

  Thereâs another big but invisible change coming to TimelineJS. In July, we announced a big update to TimelineJSÂ on the day of the release. With some minor exceptions, we were right that most people didnât notice. Next week, weâll be making another big update, which, again, we hope you wonât notice. This time, we thought we should announce it ahead of time, because timelines created before January, 2015 will probably stop working unless steps are taken.Â Timelines...
