Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2020-15092:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS
*   **Root Cause:** TimelineJS renders some user data as HTML without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious code in various data fields (Google Sheets or JSON configuration files) that gets executed when the timeline is rendered.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
*   **Impact:** An attacker can implement an XSS exploit.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Write access to the data source for the Timeline (Google Sheet or JSON file).
    *   Compromised access of a trusted user.
    *   Public write access to the Google Sheet.
    *   Write access to the system hosting the JSON document.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to version 3.7.0 or later. The fix involves sanitizing content intended for limited HTML markup and stripping all markup from content intended for simple text display. Securing write access to the Google Sheet or JSON file can also act as a workaround.
