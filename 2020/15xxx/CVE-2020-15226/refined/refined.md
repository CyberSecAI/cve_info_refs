Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the GLPI (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique) API's search function. Specifically, the `criteria` parameter in the search API endpoint was vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `value` parameters of the `criteria` array within the API request.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
- **Direct Use of User Input in SQL Query:** User-provided data was being directly incorporated into SQL queries, creating the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including:
    - The database version (`version()`).
    - The database user (`user()`).
    - The database name (`database()`).
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly demonstrated in the provided exploit, SQL injection vulnerabilities can potentially be used to modify or delete data within the database if the database user permissions allow for it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is located within the `/glpi/apirest.php/search/ticket` API endpoint.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `criteria` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **API Access:** An attacker needs access to the GLPI API, either through valid credentials or by exploiting a scenario where user input is used to generate API requests (e.g., ticket creation via API).
- **Understanding of SQL:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL queries to exploit the injection vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the API:**  The attacker needs to know the structure of the API request and the expected data to use the exploit.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GLPI instance.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes an example exploit to extract the database version using the `UNION SELECT` statement.
- The vulnerability affects GLPI versions prior to 9.5.2.
- The fix involves proper escaping of the input value with `Toolbox::addslashes_deep($criterion['value'])`.
