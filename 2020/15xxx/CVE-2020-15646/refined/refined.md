Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Thunderbird's automatic account setup process when using the Microsoft Exchange autodiscovery mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Proper Validation/Handling of Autodiscovery Responses:** Thunderbird does not properly validate or handle crafted responses during the Microsoft Exchange autodiscovery process. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious response that redirects authentication attempts.
*   **Credentials Leakage:** Thunderbird sends user credentials (username and password) over HTTPS to a server controlled by the attacker when a crafted autodiscovery response is received.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Compromise:** Attackers can steal user credentials (username and password) for Microsoft Exchange accounts. This can lead to unauthorized access to email, calendar, and other sensitive data.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The stolen credentials can be used for further attacks, such as business email compromise or other types of malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker needs to intercept Thunderbird's initial attempt to perform automatic account setup. This typically involves positioning themselves between the client (Thunderbird) and the legitimate server, potentially through network manipulation.
*   **Crafted Autodiscovery Response:** The attacker must send a crafted response to Thunderbird, which redirects the authentication process to a server controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the user's Thunderbird client and the Microsoft Exchange server. This usually involves being on the same network or controlling a network hop.
*   **Server Control:** The attacker must control a server that can receive the leaked credentials from Thunderbird.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Microsoft Exchange autodiscovery mechanism.
*   The leaked credentials are sent over HTTPS, but to the attacker's server.
*   The provided information confirms the root cause, impact, and attack vector described in the CVE description.
