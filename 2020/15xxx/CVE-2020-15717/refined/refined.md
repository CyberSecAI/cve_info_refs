The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15717.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the RosarioSIS Student Information System. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied parameters like 'tab', 'include_inactive', and 'advanced' in GET requests. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `Preferences.php`, `PrintSchedules.php`, and `Search.inc.php` files where user-controlled parameters are directly included in HTML output without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the application
*   Redirecting users to malicious sites
*   Data theft
*   Other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are the URL parameters within GET requests. Specifically:
*   `tab` parameter in `modules/Users/Preferences.php`
*  `include_inactive` parameter in `modules/Scheduling/PrintSchedules.php`
*   `advanced` parameter in `modules/Users/Search.inc.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with the XSS payload and entice a user to visit the link (e.g., by sending it in an email, posting it on a forum, etc.).
*  No specific privileges are required, as the attack is reflected and does not modify data on the server.
