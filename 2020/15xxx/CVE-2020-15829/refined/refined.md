The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15829.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Password parameters could be disclosed via build logs in TeamCity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization or filtering of sensitive information before logging it, resulting in unintended exposure of password parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could gain access to password parameters used in TeamCity builds by accessing the build logs. This could lead to unauthorized access to connected systems or services that use those passwords.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to have access to the TeamCity build logs. This could be through direct access to the TeamCity interface, or potentially through an indirect method depending on how logs are stored and accessed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would require some level of access to view TeamCity build logs to exploit this vulnerability. They do not necessarily need administrative privileges to view logs, only sufficient permissions within the context of the TeamCity installation.
