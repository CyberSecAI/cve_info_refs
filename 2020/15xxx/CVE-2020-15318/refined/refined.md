Based on the provided content, CVE-2020-15318 is related to hardcoded SSH server keys within the Zyxel CNM SecuManager software.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:** The Zyxel CNM SecuManager uses the same hardcoded SSH private keys across different installations and chroot environments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded SSH Private Keys:**  The same private keys are used for the main host and chroot environments ("Axess" and "mysql"). The specific keys are provided in the content.
*   **World-Readable Private Keys:** The private key files have permissions of 644, making them world-readable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker can use the hardcoded private keys to perform MITM attacks on SSH connections to the Zyxel CNM SecuManager. This allows the attacker to decrypt and potentially modify the encrypted SSH traffic.
*   **Decryption of Encrypted Traffic:** By having the private keys, an attacker can decrypt any traffic that was encrypted using these keys.
*   **Compromise of Management Access:** The management access using the `secu_manager` user is vulnerable to MITM/decryption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between a client and the Zyxel CNM SecuManager to intercept SSH traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network access to the Zyxel CNM SecuManager.
*   Ability to intercept network traffic.
*   Knowledge of the hardcoded SSH private keys.

The content provides extensive details, including the actual private keys, and more details than what would be expected in a typical CVE description.
