Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15866:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow within the `mrb_yield_with_class` function located in `src/vm.c` of the mruby interpreter.
- The overflow is triggered due to incorrect handling of the VM stack, specifically within the `stack_copy` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: A memory buffer on the heap is overwritten, leading to potential memory corruption.
- Incorrect VM stack handling: The `stack_copy` function does not properly manage the stack during a yield operation, leading to writing beyond allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): As shown in the provided ASAN report, a heap buffer overflow is triggered, which crashes the mruby interpreter. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap overflows can potentially be exploited to overwrite other data structures on the heap and possibly achieve arbitrary code execution.
- Unspecified impact:  The Debian security advisory mentions "possibly have unspecified other impact", which is typical for memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Ruby code: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted ruby script as input to the mruby interpreter.
- Specifically, the provided proof-of-concept (POC) leverages `singleton_methods`, `method` and `call` to create a situation where many arguments are passed through the stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to supply input to mruby: The attacker needs to be able to execute Ruby code using a vulnerable mruby interpreter. This could involve supplying malicious scripts to a web application that uses mruby, or other similar scenarios.
- No specific privileges are mentioned: The attack can be carried out by a user without special privileges, as it exploits a flaw in the mruby interpreter.
- The attacker needs to create code that triggers the vulnerable `stack_copy` in `mrb_yield_with_class`.

**Additional Details**
