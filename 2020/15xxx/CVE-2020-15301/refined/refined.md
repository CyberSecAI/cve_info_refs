- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application SuiteCRM does not sanitize user-supplied input when embedding it into CSV files. Specifically, it fails to prevent formula injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection (aka Formula Injection), lack of input validation/sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious payloads into various fields. When an administrator downloads and opens the exported CSV file, these payloads are executed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure (e.g., reading system files like `/etc/passwd`), or other malicious actions depending on the capabilities of the application opening the CSV file.
- **Attack vectors:** 
    - The attacker injects malicious payloads into fields of records in the "Accounts," "Contacts," "Opportunities," or "Leads" modules.
    - An administrator must then export the data from the vulnerable module via "Download Import File Template" feature.
    - An administrator must then open the exported CSV file with a vulnerable application (e.g. LibreOffice).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create records in one of the vulnerable modules. This implies an authenticated user with low privileges. The administrator user must download the exported CSV file and open the file.
