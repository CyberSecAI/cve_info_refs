Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-15816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the WD Discovery application's susceptibility to code injection through the use of DYLD environment variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Library Injection:** A malicious application with standard user permissions could inject code into the WD Discovery process.
*   **Unprotected DYLD Environment Variables:** The application was not properly configured to prevent the use of DYLD environment variables, which are used to specify paths to libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the WD Discovery process.
*   **Spoofed Authorization Requests:** This code execution could be leveraged to spoof authorization requests from WD Discovery, potentially leading to further unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malware:** The attack requires a malicious application to be present on the local machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious application running on the same machine as the vulnerable WD Discovery application.
*   The malicious application needs to have standard user permissions.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects both the macOS and Windows versions of WD Discovery
*   The fix was to remove the DYLD Environment Variables Entitlement and enable hardened runtime features to disable the DYLD environment variables option.
