Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-15705:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from GRUB2's failure to properly validate kernel signatures when booted directly without using shim under secure boot. This means that if a system's kernel signing certificate is directly imported into the secure boot database, GRUB2 can be tricked into loading unsigned kernels, bypassing secure boot protections.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Signature Validation**: GRUB2 lacks the proper validation of kernel signatures in a specific boot scenario.
*   **Secure Boot Bypass**: The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the security of Secure Boot, which is intended to ensure that only trusted and signed code is executed during system startup.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: An attacker can potentially gain arbitrary code execution by loading an unsigned kernel.
*   **Bypassing Secure Boot**: Secure Boot protections can be bypassed by loading untrusted or malicious code.
*   **Persistent Malware Installation**: The attacker could install a persistent bootkit or malware.
*   **Kernel Tampering**: A compromised kernel can be loaded which may include a rootkit or other malicious software.
*   **Subverted Operating System**: The attacker may gain full control over the operating system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access with elevated privileges or physical access to the system.
*   **Direct Boot:** The system needs to be configured to boot GRUB2 directly without using shim.
*   **Modified GRUB config:** Exploiting this vulnerability could involve modifying the GRUB configuration file.
*   **Imported Certificate**:  The kernel signing certificate must be imported directly into the secure boot database, rather than relying on shim.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Elevated Privileges/Physical Access**: Attackers require local access with root privileges or physical access to modify the boot configuration.
*  **Knowledge of Secure Boot Configuration:** The attacker must know if the kernel signing certificate has been directly imported into the secure boot database.
*  **Ability to Modify Boot Files:** The attacker must be able to change the GRUB configuration or access the boot partition to load their own malicious kernel.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Some sources describe this vulnerability as allowing a nefarious kernel to hide a rootkit.
*   The vulnerability affects GRUB2 versions 2.04 and prior.
*   Mitigation requires both patching GRUB2 and updating the UEFI revocation list (DBX) to prevent the loading of old, vulnerable versions.
*   The SUSE document highlights the issue affects systems where the kernel signing certificate has been imported directly into the secure boot database and the GRUB image is booted directly without the use of shim.
*   The vulnerability can also affect dual/multi-boot systems where each OS requires updates.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice USN-4432-1 provides a good description of the vulnerabilities, and references the relevant CVE's.
*   The vulnerability was also called "BootHole" as per one of the provided www.openwall.com links

The provided content confirms that this CVE is indeed about a secure boot bypass via GRUB2 and affects systems where the kernel is loaded directly without Shim. It also confirms that an attacker would need elevated privileges/physical access to exploit this. Additionally it gives some context to the fixes, notably the need to update not just GRUB but also the dbx list.
