Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied input within the `term` parameter in the `ajax_dashboard.php` file. This lack of validation allows an attacker to manipulate the input to construct malicious SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize the `term` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information in the context of the root user. The impact is classified as a high confidentiality impact (C:H) according to the CVSS score.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require any authentication (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker simply needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-02-05.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed publicly on 2020-06-25 after the ZDI's 120-day deadline passed without a patch.
*   The advisory mentions that the only viable mitigation strategy is to restrict access to the service to trusted machines, using firewall rules or whitelisting.
*   The vulnerability is present in CentOS Web Panel.
