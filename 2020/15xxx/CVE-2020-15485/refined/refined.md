Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-15485:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of medical data encryption within the Dr.Trust ECG/EKG Pen. The device stores ECG/EKG data in cleartext on its onboard flash memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Encryption:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of encryption for sensitive medical data stored in the flash memory.
- **Lack of Integrity Protection:** There is no mechanism to ensure the integrity of the stored data against tampering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Tampering:** An attacker can physically remove the flash chip from the device and modify the stored ECG/EKG data. This could lead to misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment plans, or other harmful outcomes based on the tampered data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the Dr.Trust ECG/EKG Pen.
- **Hardware Modification:** The attacker needs to remove the flash chip from the device to tamper with the stored data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:**  The attacker needs physical access to the device.
- **Technical Skills:**  The attacker needs to be able to physically remove the flash memory chip.
- **Hardware Knowledge:** The attacker also requires knowledge of how to read and modify the data from the removed chip.

**Additional Notes:**
