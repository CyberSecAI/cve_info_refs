Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-15992:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient policy enforcement in the networking component of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper implementation of security policies in the networking component, allowing a compromised renderer process to bypass the same-origin policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker who has compromised the renderer process can bypass the same-origin policy. This allows for potential unauthorized access to data and/or resources that should be protected by the policy.
- Potential arbitrary code execution through heap corruption in a related vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker uses a crafted HTML page to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker must first compromise the renderer process.
- The vulnerability is triggered via the networking component of the browser when handling a crafted HTML page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to lure a victim to visit a crafted web page
- The attacker must have already compromised the renderer process of the browser before exploiting this vulnerability.
- Network access is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Google Chrome prior to version 86.0.4240.75
- The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTML page and can lead to a sandbox escape (potential to break out of the browser's sandbox).
- Some sources also reference this vulnerability as having potential for heap corruption.

The provided content gives a good overview of the vulnerability, the affected software, and the impact of the vulnerability if successfully exploited. It mentions the specific component which is vulnerable and the required steps for the attacker to carry out the attack.
