  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The USB network servers crash due to a buffer overflow when processing excessively long input values for the server name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "The server becomes unresponsive and requires a reboot or reset to recover. The buffer overflow could potentially be exploited for code execution, although this was not investigated.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a POST request to the server containing an overly long server name value.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, and be able to send requests to the web management interface."
