  "CVE-2020-15777": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The Gradle Enterprise Maven extension versions 1.2 to 1.5.3 uses a socket connection to send serialized Java objects. Deserialization is not restricted, allowing an attacker to achieve code execution via a malicious deserialization gadget chain. The socket is not bound exclusively to localhost. This could potentially be used to achieve remote code execution and local privilege escalation.",
    "root_cause": "Unrestricted deserialization of Java objects received over a socket connection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Socket not bound exclusively to localhost"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution and local privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious serialized Java object to the vulnerable socket endpoint."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send data to the socket, which may require network access to the machine running the vulnerable Gradle Enterprise Maven extension. The specific port is random and not exposed to the public by design or documentation."
