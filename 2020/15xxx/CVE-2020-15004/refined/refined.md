The provided content includes details of multiple vulnerabilities, including those related to CVE-2020-15004.

**CVE-2020-15004 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   **Backend:** A diagnostics servlet returns the content of an HTTP GET request as part of the generated website without sanitization.
    *   **Frontend (Office):** XML properties within ODT and ODP files are not properly escaped, allowing script injection. Additionally, header and footer identifiers in OOXML content are also not sanitized, allowing for script injection.
    *   **Frontend (Calendar):** Bootstrap attributes within appointment titles are not properly sanitized allowing execution of script code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via unsanitized input in multiple components.
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Malicious script code can be executed within a user's browser session.
    *   Potential for session hijacking.
    *   Triggering unwanted actions via the web interface, such as redirection to third-party sites.
    *   Ability to send mail or delete data on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Backend:** Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code in the query parameters, which is then reflected back to the user.
    *   **Frontend (Office):**  Malicious ODT/ODP files with injected scripts within XML properties, and OOXML documents with script code in header/footer identifiers. The victim must open these files in "Edit" mode within the browser.
    *  **Frontend (Calendar):** Malicious calendar invites or within the same organization to invite the victim who needs to open the appointment pop-up.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Backend:** Attacker needs to create a malicious link and convince a user with access to the vulnerable servlet to click it. The servlet is not publicly accessible by default.
    *   **Frontend (Office):**  Attacker needs to create a malicious document and convince the victim to open and edit it through social engineering.
     * **Frontend (Calendar):** Attacker needs to send a malicious calendar invite or be part of the same organization to invite the victim.

**Additional notes:**

* The advisory details multiple instances of CVE-2020-15004 affecting different components of the OX App Suite.
*  The vulnerability in the diagnostic servlet in the backend is rated with a CVSS of 2.2, while the frontend vulnerabilities have a higher CVSS score of 4.3 and 5.4. This is due to the higher level of effort needed to exploit the vulnerability (i.e. user interaction required).
* The advisory also mentions several other vulnerabilities which were assigned different CVE IDs: CVE-2020-15002 and CVE-2020-15003.
