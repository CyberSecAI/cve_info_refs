Based on the provided text, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-15722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a local privilege escalation issue in 360 Safeguard when the TPI (likely referring to a Trusted Protection Interface) component calls the browser process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The primary vulnerability is the exploitation of DLL hijacking. This means that an attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a location where the targeted application loads a library during its execution, allowing the malicious DLL to be loaded and executed instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the local system with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the local system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the targeted system to place the malicious DLL.
- **DLL Hijacking:** This is the specific technique used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the local system where 360 Safeguard is installed.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to write files to specific locations on the filesystem to perform the DLL hijacking.
- **Understanding of Targeted Process:** The attacker likely needs knowledge of how the TPI component of 360 Safeguard calls the browser process to identify the DLL files they would need to hijack.
