Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the RosarioSIS Student Information System. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `tab`, `include_inactive`, and `advanced` parameters within GET requests before reflecting them in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application directly embeds user-controlled input into the HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session when they visit a crafted URL.
- **Potential for Data Theft, Session Hijacking, and Malicious Actions:** Attackers can use XSS to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, display phishing pages, or perform other actions within the user's browser, impersonating the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Request Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are part of GET requests.
  - `tab` parameter in `modules/Users/Preferences.php`
  - `include_inactive` parameter in `modules/Scheduling/PrintSchedules.php`
  - `advanced` parameter in `modules/Users/Search.inc.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the server.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click on a malicious link that contains the crafted XSS payload.

**Technical Details:**

- The exploit involves injecting JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters. For example:
  - `tab=1"onmouseover="alert(xss)`
  - `include_inactive=1"onmouseover="location='https://google.com'"`
  - `advanced=1"onmouseover="alert('xfr')"`
- These injected scripts execute when the user hovers over the form elements.
- The remediation example shows the use of `htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($ttt))` to sanitize the user provided value.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes Proof of Concept (PoC) URLs that demonstrate the exploit.
- The issue is tracked in GitLab issue [#291](https://gitlab.com/francoisjacquet/rosariosis/-/issues/291).
- The vulnerability was confirmed and acknowledged by the vendor.
- The CVSS v3.1 details are provided as `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`
- The fix involves sanitizing the input before it is reflected in the HTML output.
