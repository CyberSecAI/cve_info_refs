```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info, used by a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor, lacks an alignment check on the address provided by the guest. On ARM systems, memory access instructions require specific alignment.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing alignment check in the hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious guest can cause a hypervisor crash, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest administrator provides a misaligned address during the VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info hypercall.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a malicious guest administrator capable of making hypercalls."
