The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15711.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on the endpoint responsible for setting a user's favorite homepage in MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The endpoint `/userSettings/setHomePage` was vulnerable to CSRF attacks, meaning an attacker could trick a user into making unwanted changes to their settings, in this case setting a malicious URL as their homepage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could force a user to set a malicious URL as their MISP homepage. This could lead to phishing or drive-by download attacks if the attacker controls the malicious URL.
- An attacker could manipulate a victim into setting a malicious page as their default homepage.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a CSRF attack. The attacker would need to lure a user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a website under their control, which would then trigger a request to the vulnerable MISP endpoint, setting a malicious homepage in the process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious web page.
- The attacker needs no special access to the MISP instance and can target any user of a vulnerable instance.
