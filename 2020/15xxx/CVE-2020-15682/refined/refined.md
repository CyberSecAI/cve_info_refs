Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how Firefox handles prompts for opening external protocol handlers (e.g., `tel:`). When a link using an external protocol is clicked, a prompt is presented to the user to select an application. This prompt was incorrectly associated with the origin of the tab where the click was initiated, rather than the actual context where the protocol request was triggered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Origin Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker could manipulate the origin displayed in the external protocol prompt. By using a background tab, they can trigger the prompt to be associated with a different origin than the attacker's, leading the user to believe the request is coming from a trusted source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing Attack:** An attacker can trick users into believing that a request to open an external protocol handler originates from a different, potentially trusted website. This could lead users to unintentionally perform actions (e.g., make a phone call) based on false information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Background Tab Scripting:** An attacker hosts a malicious page that uses JavaScript to open a new tab and then, after a delay, uses the `window.location` to initiate an external protocol request (e.g., `tel:`).
*   **Timing-Based Trigger:** The exploit uses timing (setTimeout function) to delay the protocol request, so that the prompt is displayed while the focus remains on the attacker's controlled page, while still showing the URL of the intended victim page in the prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** An attacker must be able to host a malicious webpage.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker's page needs to execute JavaScript to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved making external protocol prompts tab-modal to prevent spoofing.
*   The vulnerability was considered a low-severity security issue.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 82 by making the external protocol prompts tab-modal and ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different origin.
*   A similar issue was identified in Chrome (<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1005596>).
*   The vulnerability was reported externally and has a corresponding security advisory.
