Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure internal verification mechanism within the "Media Content Element" (mediace) TYPO3 extension. This mechanism allows for the generation of arbitrary checksums, effectively bypassing the intended security checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cryptographic Weakness:** The core issue lies in the flawed implementation of the HMAC-SHA1 checksum verification, enabling attackers to create valid checksums for manipulated data.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Although the CVE is titled as "Sensitive Information Disclosure", the core vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary data. The disclosure is a consequence of further exploitation.
- **Insecure Deserialization & Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** By injecting arbitrary data with a valid checksum, attackers can leverage existing vulnerabilities like insecure deserialization (CVE-2016-5091) and potentially achieve remote code execution.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** Through data injection, attackers may also exploit vulnerabilities like potential privilege escalation (CVE-2020-15099) if the database server is accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By chaining this vulnerability with insecure deserialization, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the database server is accessible, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges within the system.
- **Arbitrary Data Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious data, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate data that relies on the checksum verification, leading to various impacts depending on the specific use case.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  The combination of RCE and privilege escalation could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network, allowing remote exploitation.
- **HTTP GET Parameters:** The vulnerable mechanism uses HTTP GET parameters to process the data to be verified, which are easily manipulated by attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** Attackers do not need any prior privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the TYPO3 instance.
- **Database Server Accessibility (for privilege escalation):** For potential privilege escalation via CVE-2020-15099, the attacker needs to reach the database server either via the internet or a shared hosting network.
- **Extbase Plugin/Module Action Access (for RCE):** For the Remote Code Execution via CVE-2016-5091 the attacker requires access to an Extbase plugin or module action in the TYPO3 installation.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is located in the `mediace` extension for TYPO3, specifically in the `Resources/PHP/ValidateHashEID.php` file.
- The fix involves restricting the scope of the checksum generation to prevent arbitrary data injection, as detailed in the provided commit and pull request.
- The advisory recommends uninstalling the extension if not needed, or upgrading to version 7.6.5 and changing the encryption key and database credentials.
- The CVSS score of 9.1 indicates a critical severity, based on the potential impact of the vulnerability and the ease of exploitation.
- The github advisory also indicates a 9.8 CVSS score based on the base metrics.
- The content also lists the associated CWEs: CWE-325, CWE-20, CWE-200, CWE-502, indicating the nature of the vulnerability as improper check of authenticity, input validation, information exposure, and deserialization.
