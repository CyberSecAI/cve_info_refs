# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2020-014: Sensitive Information Disclosure in extension "Media Content Element" (mediace)

Categories:
[Development](/help/security-advisories/development "Development")

Created by Oliver Hader

It has been discovered that the extension "Media Content Element" (mediace) is susceptible to Sensitive Information Disclosure.

* Release Date: July 28, 2020
* Component Type: Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.
* Component: Media Content Element (mediace)
* Vulnerability Type: Sensitive Information Disclosure
* Affected Versions: 7.6.4 and below
* Severity: Critical
* Suggested CVSS: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)
* References: [CVE-2020-15086](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15086)

### Problem Description

It has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described below.

* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007), [CVE-2020-15099](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099): **Potential Privilege Escalation**
  + the database server used for a TYPO3 installation must be accessible for an attacker (either via internet or shared hosting network)
  + CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (7.5, high)
* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013), [CVE-2016-5091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5091): **Insecure Deserialization & Remote Code Execution**
  + an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation
  + CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (9.1, critical)

 The overall severity of this vulnerability is **critical (9.1)** based on mentioned attack chains and the fact it does not require any privileges.

### Solution

In case the extension is not used and required at all, it is suggested to uninstall and remove it from the system completely. Otherwise, an updated version 7.6.5 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager, Packagist and the TYPO3 extension repository:

* <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/download/mediace/7.6.5/zip/>
* <https://packagist.org/packages/friendsoftypo3/mediace#7.6.5>

As a precautionary measure it is advised to change *encryptionKey* and database credentials in *typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php*.

### Credits

Thanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.

### General Advice

Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Security/Index.html#security-guidelines). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Affected versions

>= 7.6.2, <= 7.6.4

## Patched versions

7.6.5

## Description

> ### Meta
>
> * CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (9.1)
> * CWE-325, CWE-20, CWE-200, CWE-502

### Problem

It has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described below.

* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007), [CVE-2020-15099](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099): Potential Privilege Escalation
  + the database server used for a TYPO3 installation must be accessible for an attacker (either via internet or shared hosting network)
  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (7.5, high)
* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013), [CVE-2016-5091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5091): Insecure Deserialization & Remote Code Execution
  + an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation
  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (9.1, critical)

The overall severity of this vulnerability is critical (9.1) based on mentioned attack chains and the fact it does not require any privileges.

### Solution

In case the extension is not used and required at all, it is suggested to uninstall and remove it from the system completely. Otherwise, an updated version 7.6.5 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager, Packagist and the TYPO3 extension repository:

* <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/download/mediace/7.6.5/zip/>
* <https://packagist.org/packages/friendsoftypo3/mediace#7.6.5>

As a precautionary measure it is advised to change `encryptionKey` and database credentials in `typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php`.

### Credits
