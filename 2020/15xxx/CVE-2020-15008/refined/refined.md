Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the ConnectWise Automate probe's implementation for saving data to a custom table.
*   The server-side code that processes the custom data lacks sufficient validation of user-provided input when constructing SQL queries.
*   Specifically, the table name supplied by the user is used directly in the dynamically generated SQL INSERT statement without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the table name, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Database Updates:** An attacker can modify any data within the database.
*   **Data Extraction:** Using SQL injection techniques like timing attacks, attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Full System Takeover:** When combined with CVE-2020-15027 (an authentication bypass), an attacker can achieve full control of vulnerable ConnectWise Automate instances that have network probes enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted payload through the ConnectWise Automate probe. This payload includes a manipulated "tablename" parameter designed to inject SQL code.
*   The payload is sent via a `<LTS>` XML tag, specifically within the `<Data>` section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Probe Computer:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with a ConnectWise Automate probe computer.
*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with low privileges, as stated in the CVSS vector string (PR:L).
*   **Medium Complexity:** Exploitation has a complexity of medium, which implies some technical understanding is required.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted malicious payload to the target system

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided example payload demonstrates how the `tablename` parameter can be crafted to include SQL injection code, such as `probe_events` SET eventmessage=1 OR UPDATEXML(1,CONCAT(0x7e,(VERSION())),0) OR '1' WHERE probeid =2 AND eventtime = '2020-05-22 00:25:48' #`. This payload would attempt to update the `eventmessage` column or exfiltrate the MySQL version of the database, illustrating the SQL injection.

**Patch Information:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in ConnectWise Automate version 2020.7 and a hotfix for version 2019.12.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   CVSS 3.1 Base Score: 8.5
*   CVSS 3.1 Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:H/MUI:N/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H
*   CVSS 3.1 Temporal Score: 7.9
*   CVSS 3.1 Environmental Score: 7.5
