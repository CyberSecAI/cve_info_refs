# v10.3 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 4 May 2021

**End of Fix**: 4 May 2022

**End of Support**: 4 May 2024 (More details are [[here](../../../User-Guide/Content/Deployment/Updating-NAKIVO-Backup-and-Replication/NAKIVO-Backup-and-Replication-Support-Lifecycle-Policy.htm)](../../../User-Guide/Content/Deployment/Updating-NAKIVO-Backup-and-Replication/NAKIVO-Backup-and-Replication-Support-Lifestyle-Policy.htm).)

## New Features

**Direct Connect (No-VPN)**

The feature allows NAKIVO Backup & Replication installed at MSP/CSP site to access remote resources of an MSP/CSP client via a single port connection (port should be exposed by a client) without the need to establish a VPN connection. Supported platforms: VMware.

**Backup & Recovery of Exchange Online contacts and calendars**

Backup and recover Exchange Online contacts and calendars with NAKIVO Backup & Replication. Before using the product for data protection of your Microsoft 365 objects, make sure you meet the necessary requirements and enable the required API permissions. For platform limitations, refer to the corresponding section of the known issues below.

**VMware Cloud Director Support**

The feature allows you to back up and recover VMware Cloud Director objects including:

* vApps which consist of one or more VMs that communicate over a network and use resourcesand services in a VMware Cloud environment;
* individual VMs.

**Backup from Storage Snapshots**

Add HPE 3PAR storage to NAKIVO Backup & Replication to back up VMware VMs from HPE 3PAR storage snapshots. A storage snapshot can be created within seconds, and it consumes a small amount of space which, in its turn, reduces the impact of backup activities on the production environment and improves RPOs.

**User Interface Enhancement (Facelift)**

Enjoy the enhanced look and functionality of the NAKIVO Backup and Replication installation and update pages.

**Harden Transporter**

The feature allows you to use certificates and pre-shared keys for Transporters to make NAKIVO Backup & Replication more secure.
