Closes [#4926](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/4926)

The dump consensus state had this:

      "last_commit": {
        "votes": [
          "Vote{0:04CBBF43CA3E 385085/00/2(Precommit) 1B73DA9FC4C8 42C97B86D89D @ 2020-05-27T06:46:51.042392895Z}",
          "Vote{1:055799E028FA 385085/00/2(Precommit) 652B08AD61EA 0D507D7FA3AB @ 2020-06-28T04:57:29.20793209Z}",
          "Vote{2:056024CFA910 385085/00/2(Precommit) 652B08AD61EA C8E95532A4C3 @ 2020-06-28T04:57:29.452696998Z}",
          "Vote{3:0741C95814DA 385085/00/2(Precommit) 652B08AD61EA 36D567615F7C @ 2020-06-28T04:57:29.279788593Z}",

Note there's a precommit in there from the first val from May (2020-05-27) while the rest are from today (2020-06-28). It suggests there's a validator from an old instance of the network at this height (they're using the same chain-id!). Obviously a single bad validator shouldn't be an issue. But the Commit refactor work introduced a bug.

When we propose a block, we get the block.LastCommit by calling MakeCommit on the set of precommits we saw for the last height. This set may include precommits for a different block, and hence the block.LastCommit we propose may include precommits that aren't actually for the last block (but of course +2/3 will be). Before v0.33, we just skipped over these precommits during verification. But in v0.33, we expect all signatures for a blockID to be for the same block ID! Thus we end up proposing a block that we can't verify.
```

# Security

At Tendermint, we highly value security. Learn about how we deal with security and vulnerability reports below.

## Vulnerabilties

Security researchers and white hat hackers are a vital part of building strong, resilient cryptocurrency protocols. At Tendermint & Cosmos, we actively support the work that hackers and researchers do to find, report and patch security vulnerabilities.

If you're here because you're trying to figure out how to notify us of a security issue, please send an email to us directly at security@tendermint.com, or report the issue to our public HackerOne program. Please avoid opening public issues on Github that contain information about a potential security vulnerability as this makes it difficult to reduce the impact and harm of valid security issues.

### Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We ask security researchers to keep vulnerabilities and communications around vulnerability submissions private and confidential until a patch is developed to protect the people using Tendermint’s protocols. In addition to this, we ask that you:

* Allow us a reasonable amount of time to correct or address security vulnerabilities.
* Avoid exploiting any vulnerabilities that you discover.
* Demonstrate good faith by not disrupting or degrading Tendermint’s data or services.

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

Tendermint uses the following disclosure process:

1. Once a security report is received, the Tendermint team works to verify the issue and confirm its severity level using CVSS.
2. The Tendermint team collaborates with the Gaia team to determine the vulnerability’s potential impact on the Cosmos Hub.
3. Patches are prepared for eligible releases of Tendermint in private repositories. See “Supported Releases” below for more information on which releases are considered eligible.
4. If it is determined that a CVE-ID is required, we request a CVE through a CVE Numbering Authority.
5. We notify the community that a security release is coming, to give users time to prepare their systems for the update. Notifications can include forum posts, tweets, and emails to partners and validators, including emails sent to the [Tendermint Security Mailing List  (opens new window)](https://berlin.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=431b35421ff7edcc77df5df10&id=3fe93307bc).
6. 24 hours following this notification, the fixes are applied publicly and new releases are issued.
7. Cosmos SDK and Gaia update their Tendermint dependencies to use these releases, and then themselves issue new releases.
8. Once releases are available for Tendermint, Cosmos SDK and Gaia, we notify the community, again, through the same channels as above. We also publish a Security Advisory on Github and publish the CVE, as long as neither the Security Advisory nor the CVE include any information on how to exploit these vulnerabilities beyond what information is already available in the patch itself.
9. Once the community is notified, we will pay out any relevant bug bounties to submitters.
10. One week after the releases go out, we will publish a post with further details on the vulnerability as well as our response to it.

This process can take some time. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it's important that we follow the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled consistently and to keep Tendermint and its downstream dependent projects--including but not limited to Gaia and the Cosmos Hub--as secure as possible.

## Bug Bounty Program

At Tendermint, we strongly believe in compensating researchers for the time they spend in making cryptocurrencies stronger and more resilient. Depending on the severity and criticality of an issue, researchers who report bugs and respect our vulnerability disclosure policy may be eligible for rewards through our [bug bounty program  (opens new window)](https://blog.cosmos.network/bug-bounty-program-for-tendermint-cosmos-833c67693586?gi=1f112c3a0ca2) with HackerOne.

* Bounty reward amounts are based on many factors, including impact, risk, likelihood of exploitation, and report quality.
* For severe bugs or exceptional bug reports, we may decide to pay lower-tier bugs a higher-tier reward.
* If we receive duplicate bug reports, we will award a bounty to the first person who reported the issue.
  Any bugs that are found in services that we use (i.e. Mailchimp, Meetup, Discord) are ineligible for rewards, and should be disclosed directly to those services.
* To learn more about the scope of our bug bounty program or to report a bug, please visit HackerOne.

## Scope

The full scope of our bug bounty program is outlined on our [Hacker One program page  (opens new window)](https://hackerone.com/cosmos). Please also note that, in the interest of the safety of our users and staff, a few things are explicitly excluded from scope:

* Any third-party services
* Findings from physical testing, such as office access
* Findings derived from social engineering (e.g., phishing)

## Contact Us

You can contact our team directly at security@tendermint.com which is monitored by the team, or report issues to us through our bug bounty program on HackerOne. Please avoid filing security issues in public repositories as this method of contact fully discloses security bugs to friends and adversaries alike, and makes it difficult for us to reduce harm for our users and community.

**Environment**:

* **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release):

```
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:  Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
Release:  18.04
Codename: bionic

```

* **Install tools**:

Using COSMOS SDK v0.38.3. Otherwise, not sure what else to say here.

* **Others**:

We are running a testnet chain with our CRUD database as one of the application modules, in COSMOS.

We currently (as of filing this issue) have 5 "sentries" and 3 validators. To be clear, the sentries have no voting power and are the only peers that the validators talk to (the validators can talk to each other too). Furthermore, the validators are IP firewalled to only be able to talk to the sentries and other validators. The sentries themselves keep the validator node id's private.

Sentry hostnames:

```
a.sentry.testnet.public.bluzelle.com
b.sentry.testnet.public.bluzelle.com
c.sentry.testnet.public.bluzelle.com
d.sentry.testnet.public.bluzelle.com
e.sentry.testnet.public.bluzelle.com

```

I am not listing the validator hostnames, since they are inaccessible (due to the firewall) anyways.

The validators are only listening on 26656 to validators and sentries. The sentries are listening on 26656 and 26657 and also each run the cosmos REST server, listening on 1317.

We have opened our testnet to the public. Members of the public have setup sentries and validators of their own, and are expected to use our five sentries as their P2P peers in config.toml.

**What happened**:

For weeks, things on our testnet had been running fine. I had dozens of members of the public running validators on it, just so these people could learn the process of setting up a validator, etc.

I needed to increase the max # of allowed validators (to something much higher than the default value of 100) in the "app\_state/staking/params/max\_validators" value in genesis.json. I think that this particular value is a COSMOS thing, but I wanted to mention it for context. We are not using COSMOS governance yet, so we decided to do a hard reset (ie: generate a new genesis.json and start the chain all over).

First, here is what I did on my OWN 5 sentries and 3 validators:

* Stopped all my sentries and validators.
* Wiped out their .blzd folders (this is the name of my "home" folder for my "blzd" daemons). Because of this, the nodes will all get new node ids and will be new "peers".
* Re-initialized each sentry and validator with "blzd init", etc... much like I always do when I setup a validator or sentry from scratch (setting up peers, etc). I had also increased the "max\_num\_inbound\_peers" to 800 and "max\_num\_outbound\_peers" to 200, in the [p2p] section of config.toml. This might only be anecdotal in value. I had an issue where we had too many connects to my sentries and they were dropping connections on the p2p port.
* Generated the new genesis.
* Deployed this genesis to all the sentries and validators.
* Run the necessary COSMOS commands to get the validators staked, created, etc.
* Start up all my sentries and validators, (thereby starting up the new chain from block 0).

Next, here is what I asked the people in the community to do with their validator and/or sentries:

* Run "blzd unsafe-reset-all" on all their daemons. I asked the community do this instead of wiping out the ".blzd" folder, to save them some work.
* Copy over the new genesis.json file, replacing the old genesis.json.
* Set the new peers list in the p2p section of config.toml.
* Run the necessary COSMOS commands to get the validators staked, created, etc.
* Start up their sentries and validators.

The community slowly started up their daemons.

At some point (within an hour or so, about 2300 blocks in), I started to get the error below. I was getting this on all my sentries and validators. Basically, the chain had completely crashed. I tried to restart my validators and sentries, but this was unrecoverable.

```
E[2020-05-29|03:03:32.975] enterPrevote: ProposalBlock is invalid       module=consensus height=2285 round=0 err="wrong signature (#35): C683341000384EA00A345F9DB9608292F65EE83B51752C0A375A9FCFC2BD895E0792A0727925845DC13BA0E208C38B7B12B2218B2FE29B6D9135C53D7F253D05"
E[2020-05-29|03:03:35.128] enterPrevote: ProposalBlock is invalid       module=consensus height=2285 round=1 err="wrong signature (#35): C683341000384EA00A345F9DB9608292F65EE83B51752C0A375A9FCFC2BD895E0792A0727925845DC13BA0E208C38B7B12B2218B2FE29B6D9135C53D7F253D05"
E[2020-05-29|03:03:37.255] enterPrevote: ProposalBlock is invalid       module=consensus height=2285 round=2 err="wrong signature (#35): C683341000384EA00A345F9DB9608292F65EE83B51752C0A375A9FCFC2BD895E0792A0727925845DC13BA0E208C38B7B12B2218B2FE29B6D9135C53D7F253D05"
.
.
.

```

To had no choice but to "reset" the whole chain again. I stopped all my validators and sentries and this time, ONLY ran "unsafe-reset-all" on all my daemons. Of course, I also had to do some COSMOS setup again (staking, etc), but started everything again, and asked the community to again do the same steps listed above with yet a new genesis.json, etc.

Within an hour, the whole network went down again. Effectively the same error (different block, signature HASH this time):

```
.
.
.
E[2020-05-29|06:57:48.621] enterPrevote: ProposalBlock is invalid       module=consensus height=676 round=146 err="wrong signature (#8): 62A6A628CFB1F72D76C48F71A928DD628E29585DD4B861EDF3F216E77FBB0A7C492D2280B218FBA34A0751F02961C2657708711D3F212800CFE847B804F0360D
.
.
.

```

**What you expected to happen**:

I expect "clean" output, as so:

```
I[2020-05-30|21:53:04.286] Executed block                               module=state height=20416 validTxs=0 invalidTxs=2
I[2020-05-30|21:53:04.309] Committed state                              module=state height=20416 txs=2 appHash=80D70DC5FF062F34D3F79F15FC85CB367A5A7F9CF39B4EE6C1DC68E9F1958EA1

```

(The fact that invalidTxs is non-zero is the subject of another investigation)

**Have you tried the latest version**:

Not sure. I think so. Although in looking at the Tendermint Github, I see there are two minor versions available that are newer than what we have.

**How to reproduce it**:

I more or less explained how it came about above in the "what happened" section.

Looking at [#2720](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/2720), I see a similar error message, but not quite the same. But in looking at that issue, it was suggested that perhaps all the nodes did not start from the same "genesis" state. It is suggested that perhaps some node(s) have a stale "home folder" (.blzd, I presume?).

Does "unsafe-reset-all" actually clear out all state including the COSMOS KV stores, app state, etc? I assume this command is sufficient to accomplish a clean slate?

Is it possible that in "resetting" my chain as I did above, some members of the public possibly forgot to run that "blzd unsafe-reset-all" command, and by missing this step, when they started their node, it had data from the previous chain left over, and this somehow brought the whole network down? If so, it is a bit scary that a single node (or even a bunch of them) could do this. It is an excellent DoS attack vector, it seems, if so.

**Logs**:

Listed above.

**Config**:

No specific changes made to Tendermint.

**node command runtime flags**:

This is all running from within our daemon that was built with the COSMOS SDK.

**`/dump_consensus_state` output for consensus bugs**

Not sure how to do this.

**Anything else we need to know**:

Most details given above.

I did some searching ahead of time to see if I could resolve this myself. I saw some issues related to it but they are already closed.

Tendermint Core is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a
state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely
replicates it on many machines.

For protocol details, refer to the [Tendermint Specification](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/spec/README.md).

For detailed analysis of the consensus protocol, including safety and liveness
proofs, read our paper, "[The latest gossip on BFT
consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938)".

## Documentation

Complete documentation can be found on the
[website](https://docs.tendermint.com/).

## Releases

Please do not depend on `main` as your production branch. Use
[releases](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases) instead.

Tendermint has been in the production of private and public environments, most
notably the blockchains of the Cosmos Network. we haven't released v1.0 yet
since we are making breaking changes to the protocol and the APIs. See below for
more details about [versioning](#versioning).

In any case, if you intend to run Tendermint in production, we're happy to help.
You can contact us over email or [join the
chat](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork).

More on how releases are conducted can be found [here](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/RELEASES.md).

## Security

To report a security vulnerability, see our [bug bounty
program](https://hackerone.com/cosmos). For examples of the kinds of bugs we're
looking for, see [our security policy](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

We also maintain a dedicated mailing list for security updates. We will only
ever use this mailing list to notify you of vulnerabilities and fixes in
Tendermint Core. You can subscribe [here](http://eepurl.com/gZ5hQD).

## Contributing

Please abide by the [Code of Conduct](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions.

Before contributing to the project, please take a look at the [contributing
guidelines](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [style guide](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/STYLE_GUIDE.md). You may also
find it helpful to read the [specifications](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/spec/README.md), and familiarize
yourself with our [Architectural Decision Records
(ADRs)](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/docs/architecture/README.md) and
[Request For Comments (RFCs)](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/docs/rfc/README.md).

## Versioning

### Semantic Versioning

Tendermint uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) to determine when and
how the version changes. According to SemVer, anything in the public API can
change at any time before version 1.0.0

To provide some stability to users of 0.X.X versions of Tendermint, the MINOR
version is used to signal breaking changes across Tendermint's API. This API
includes all publicly exposed types, functions, and methods in non-internal Go
packages as well as the types and methods accessible via the Tendermint RPC
interface.

Breaking changes to these public APIs will be documented in the CHANGELOG.

### Upgrades

In an effort to avoid accumulating technical debt prior to 1.0.0, we do not
guarantee that breaking changes (ie. bumps in the MINOR version) will work with
existing Tendermint blockchains. In these cases you will have to start a new
blockchain, or write something custom to get the old data into the new chain.
However, any bump in the PATCH version should be compatible with existing
blockchain histories.

For more information on upgrading, see [UPGRADING.md](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/UPGRADING.md).

### Supported Versions

Because we are a small core team, we only ship patch updates, including security
updates, to the most recent minor release and the second-most recent minor
release. Consequently, we strongly recommend keeping Tendermint up-to-date.
Upgrading instructions can be found in [UPGRADING.md](/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/UPGRADING.md).

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= v0.33.0

## Patched versions

v0.33.6

## Description

### Description

**Denial of Service**

Tendermint 0.33.0 and above allow block proposers to include signatures for the wrong block. This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it without changing the chainID. (It is a [misconfiguration](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html) to reuse chainIDs.) Correct block proposers will accidentally include signatures for the wrong block if they see these signatures, and then commits won't validate, making all proposed blocks invalid. A malicious validator (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network.

Tendermint 0.33.6 checks all the signatures are for the block with +2/3 majority before creating a commit.

**False Witness**

Tendermint 0.33.1 and above are no longer fully verifying commit signatures during block execution - they stop after +2/3. This means proposers can propose blocks that contain valid +2/3 signatures and then the rest of the signatures can be whatever they want. They can claim that all the other validators signed just by including a CommitSig with arbitrary signature data. While this doesn't seem to impact safety of Tendermint per se, it means that Commits may contain a lot of invalid data \*\*.

*\*\* This was already true of blocks, since they could include invalid txs filled with garbage, but in that case the application knew that they are invalid and could punish the proposer. But since applications didn't--and don't-- verify commit signatures directly (they trust Tendermint to do that), they won't be able to detect it.*

This can impact incentivization logic in the application that depends on the LastCommitInfo sent in BeginBlock, which includes which validators signed. For instance, Gaia incentivizes proposers with a bonus for including more than +2/3 of the signatures. But a proposer can now claim that bonus just by including arbitrary data for the final -1/3 of validators without actually waiting for their signatures. There may be other tricks that can be played because of this.

Tendermint 0.33.6 verifies all the signatures during block execution \*\*\*.

*\*\*\* Please note that the light client does not check nil votes and exits as soon as 2/3+ of the signatures are checked.*

### Impact

* All nodes
* The network stops due to having a commit with a wrong signature.
