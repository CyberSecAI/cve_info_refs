Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Tendermint handles precommits (votes) from previous rounds or old instances of the network, especially when the same chain ID is reused. The `MakeCommit` function could include precommits for a different block in the `LastCommit` field of the proposed block.

Specifically, the commit refactor introduced a bug where `MakeCommit` on a set of precommits might include precommits from a different block, causing the `block.LastCommit` to include signatures that aren't for the current block.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Signature Handling:** Tendermint versions prior to the patch did not properly verify if all signatures within a commit were indeed for the same block. This could happen if a validator from a previous instance of the network (same chain-id) sends a precommit, or a malicious validator sends precommits for the wrong block.
2.  **Incomplete Signature Verification:** Tendermint stopped verifying commit signatures after reaching a +2/3 majority, allowing proposers to include arbitrary data for the remaining signatures.
3.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a block proposal with mixed or invalid signatures, an attacker could halt the entire network. This can be achieved even with a minimal amount of stake.
4.  **False Witness**: Malicious proposers could forge signatures without the actual validators signing, particularly for the final 1/3 of validators, thereby claiming incentives or rewards that they didn't earn, especially in applications that rely on accurate information about who signed the last commit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Network Halt:** A malicious actor could bring the network to a complete standstill by including precommits for the wrong block, making subsequent block proposals invalid.
2.  **False Incentivization:** A proposer could claim rewards and incentives by including arbitrary or fake signatures in the Commit without proper validation. This affects applications that rely on the `LastCommitInfo`.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Validator:** A validator could intentionally create a block with incorrect signatures for the wrong block.
2.  **Reusing Chain ID:** When a network is restarted without changing the chainID, it may include precommits from an old instance of the network with the same chain-id.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Validator Status:** The attacker must be a validator on the network, though even a validator with minimal stake can exploit this vulnerability.
2.  **Network Participation:** The attacker must be able to propose blocks, or have the ability to send precommits for old blocks.
3. **Network Restart**: The vulnerability can be exploited when a network is restarted without changing chainID, an old instance validator might send a precommit for a block that doesn't belong to the new instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that all signatures within a commit are for the correct block before creating the commit and verifying all commit signatures.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Tendermint v0.33.6.
*   There were no known workarounds.
*   The issue was reported through GitHub issue #4926.
*   The vulnerability is identified with CVE-2020-15091.
*   The security advisory is titled "Syringa" and was published on July 2, 2020.
