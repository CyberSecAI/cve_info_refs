Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15467:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `vns3:vpn` appliance's administrative interface, specifically within the `/tcpdump` API. The `iface` POST parameter is not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization of the `iface` POST parameter in the `/tcpdump` API.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in remote code execution (RCE) on the affected systems. This can lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to gain access to user credentials and move laterally within the compromised network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web-based administrative interface of the `vns3:vpn` appliance.
- Specifically, the vulnerable API endpoint is located at `/tcpdump` accessible via HTTP/HTTPS port 8000.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `/tcpdump` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the `vns3:vpn` appliance with a user account that has access to the vulnerable web API.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/HTTPS requests to the affected `/tcpdump` endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of `vns3:vpn` appliance before 4.11.1.
- The vendor, Cohesive Networks, has released a patch in version 4.11.1 to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jake Valletta from Mandiant FireEye.
- Mandiant also published an advisory regarding this issue.
