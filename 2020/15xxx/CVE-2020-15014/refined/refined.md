- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `changepass.php` file does not perform any checks on the `Referer` header or implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection measures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability. The application does not validate the origin of the password change request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a password change request to the vulnerable application. This allows the attacker to change the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that automatically submits a password change request to the vulnerable application when visited by a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into opening the malicious HTML page. The attacker does not require access to the target server itself.
