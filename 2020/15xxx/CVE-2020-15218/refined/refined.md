Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper caching of admin pages, which allows a user to view the content of those pages even after logging out by using the browser's back button. Additionally, these pages can be embedded in iframes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Caching:** Admin pages are cached by the browser, and the cache is not invalidated upon logout.
- **Iframe Embeddability:** Admin pages can be embedded within iframes, potentially leading to clickjacking or other embedding-related attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A user who has logged out can still potentially view sensitive information from the cached admin pages by using the browser's back button, which circumvents the logout mechanism.
- **Clickjacking:** The ability to embed admin pages in iframes could allow attackers to perform clickjacking attacks if the pages lack proper protection against iframe embedding.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Browser Back Button:** The primary vector is exploiting browser caching by using the browser's back button after logging out of the application.
- **Iframe Embedding:** Attackers can embed the vulnerable admin pages into malicious websites via iframes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Previous Access:** The attacker would need to have had a valid user session at some point in order to access and cache the admin pages in the browser.
- **No Active Session Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited after the user has logged out, as the pages are cached.
- **Iframe Access:** To leverage the embedding vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to create an HTML page containing an iframe pointing to the vulnerable admin page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was discovered and reported by Cyblex Technologies.
- It also indicates that there are no associated CWEs.
