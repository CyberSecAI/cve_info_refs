Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15152:

*   **Vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **Affected Package:** `ftp-srv` npm package
*   **Affected Versions:** `<2.19.6`, `<3.1.2`, `<4.3.4`
*   **Patched Versions:** `^2.19.6`, `^3.1.2`, `^4.3.4`
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the FTP protocol's handling of data connections. Specifically, the `PORT` command, which allows the client to specify the IP address and port for the server to connect back to the client for data transfer.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious client could send an arbitrary IP address via the `PORT` command, causing the `ftp-srv` server to initiate a connection to an unintended destination.
*   **Impact:** This could be exploited to perform internal port scanning, information disclosure, or potentially interact with internal services that are not meant to be exposed to the outside world, leading to SSRF.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server as a client and issue FTP commands.
*   **Workarounds:** Blacklisting the FTP `PORT` command.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves ensuring that the data socket the server connects to via the PORT command uses the same IP address as the current command socket. This is implemented in commit `e449e75219d918c400dec65b4b0759f60476abca`. The fix adds a check in `src/connector/active.js` to verify that the IP address provided in the PORT command matches the IP address of the command socket. If the IPs don't match, the connection is rejected with a `SocketError`.
