The provided content details multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the GOG Galaxy client, and it explicitly mentions CVE-2020-15528 and CVE-2020-15529.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GOG Galaxy client service runs as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" and interacts with the client to perform tasks like game installation and updates. Several locations within the installation directory, such as the "Games" folder and a temporary file location ("C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Dependencies\\_\_redist\ISI"), allow modification by standard users. This, combined with the service's elevated privileges, allows for multiple avenues of attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Unrestricted Modification:** The "Games" folder and the temporary file location for `scriptinterpreter.tmp` can be modified by standard users.
2.  **Elevated Execution of User-Controlled Files:** The `GalaxyClientService` executes files (such as game executables, uninstallers, and `scriptinterpreter.exe`) located in user-writable directories with elevated privileges.
3.  **Missing Input Validation:** The GOG Galaxy Client does not validate the integrity of the game files or the uninstaller before execution when using the repair or uninstall options.
4.  **Oplock abuse:** The use of oplocks allows the attacker to modify `scriptinterpreter.exe` during the repair process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows a local attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. This means the attacker can gain full control of the system, install malware, create new user accounts and change system settings.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities can be exploited through several methods:

1.  **Evil Game:** Replacing a game executable (e.g., DOSBox) with a malicious one and using the GOG Galaxy client to launch the game, thus executing the malicious executable with elevated privileges.
2.  **Evil Uninstall:** Replacing a game uninstaller with a malicious one, resulting in the execution of the malicious uninstaller with elevated privileges when the user uninstalls the game.
3.  **Evil Repair:** Damaging a game, triggering the "Verify/Repair" option which downloads `scriptinterpreter.exe`, then using oplocks to replace it with a malicious version that will be executed with elevated privileges.
4.  **Evil Install:** Using oplocks to replace `scriptinterpreter.exe` with a malicious version during game installation, resulting in elevated code execution.
5.  **Evil Service:** Using one of the above methods to gain elevated rights, then replacing the "GalaxyCommunication" service executable with a malicious one, which will then execute with SYSTEM privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to modify files within the GOG Galaxy installation directory, specifically the game installation folder and the temporary file location. No other specific capabilities are required.
