Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-15649:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of file names returned by a malicious file picker application when handling file uploads in Firefox for Android.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal: The `_display_name` column returned by a malicious file picker application is not sanitized. It can contain directory traversal sequences like `..`, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary paths in Firefox's internal directory.
- File Overwrite/Exfiltration: Due to the missing sanitization, the file path provided by the malicious app is used to create a temporary file, allowing for the overwriting of existing internal files, or reading (exfiltrating) them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local File Overwrite: An attacker can overwrite any file within Firefox's private directory, including configuration files, leading to potential manipulation of browser settings and behavior. As demonstrated in the provided example, the attacker could overwrite the `profile.ini` file to point the profile directory to a location under their control.
- Sensitive Data Exfiltration: An attacker, by controlling the file picker application, can read the content of sensitive files, effectively exfiltrating them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File Picker Application: The attacker must have a malicious file picker application installed on the victim's Android device.
- File Upload Trigger: The user must initiate a file upload within Firefox for Android.
- Malicious File Picker Selection: The user must select the malicious file picker application when prompted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and install a malicious file picker app on the user's device.
- User interaction to trigger the vulnerable file upload process.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability specifically affects Firefox for Android.
- The vulnerability is located in the `FilePickerResultHandler` class, where the file name from the cursor is not sanitized before creating a temporary file.
- The fix involves sanitizing the filename by extracting the last child from the path, removing path traversal sequences.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox ESR 68.11.
