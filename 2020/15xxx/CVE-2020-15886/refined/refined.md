**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `reportdata` module of MunkiReport. This vulnerability is triggered when handling the 'req' GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize or properly escape user-supplied input passed via the `req` GET parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Queries:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, enabling them to execute arbitrary queries against the database.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Potential Code Execution:** In some cases, if the database configuration allows, it might be possible to achieve code execution on the server through the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The primary attack vector is through the `req` parameter in an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the MunkiReport application.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects MunkiReport versions from 2.5.3 to 5.6.2
- The vulnerable code is located in the `reportdata` module.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves either upgrading to the latest version of MunkiReport or updating the `reportdata` module to version 3.5.
