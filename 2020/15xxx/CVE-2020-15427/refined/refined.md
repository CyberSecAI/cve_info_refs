- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of the `folderName` parameter in `ajax_disk_usage.php` before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious request to the `ajax_disk_usage.php` endpoint with a crafted `folderName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, and the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
