Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2020-15916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `httpd` binary file processes the `deviceName` and `lanIp` parameters without proper sanitization. These parameters are directly passed to a `doSystemCmd` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The lack of input sanitization in handling the `deviceName` and `lanIp` parameters in `httpd` allows for command injection and arbitrary code execution.
- **Insufficient Data Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user-controlled parameters before using them in system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary command execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
- **Persistent reverse shell:** By exploiting the RCE vulnerability in conjunction with the `lan.ip` parameter, attackers can establish a persistent reverse shell on the device, giving them complete control even after reboots.
- **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can achieve persistent unauthenticated root access to the device, potentially using it as a botnet for external or internal attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** An authenticated request can be crafted to set the `deviceName` parameter in the web interface, leading to code execution.
- **Root Shell:** The `lan.ip` parameter can be manipulated via a root shell obtained by exploiting other vulnerabilities (such as the hardcoded telnet password).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Initial access is authenticated:** To directly exploit RCE through the `deviceName` parameter, the attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface.
- **Unauthenticated access via hardcoded credentials:**  However, combined with the hardcoded credentials in the firmware and the telnet exploit, this vulnerability can also be exploited without authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router.

**Additional Notes:**
- The article highlights the possibility of achieving persistent root access and using the exploited device as part of a botnet.
- The vulnerability in `lan.ip` is persistent even through reboots, and only a factory reset will remove it.
- This vulnerability is linked to other vulnerabilities found in the Tenda AC1900, enhancing the overall impact.
