Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-15893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service on the D-Link DIR-816L router allows command injection via a crafted M-SEARCH packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The router's UPnP implementation does not properly sanitize the `Search Target` (ST) field in SSDP M-SEARCH discovery packets. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to enable the telnet service, providing a remote shell for the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the UPnP service, which is enabled by default on port 1900 of the router.
- An attacker sends a crafted SSDP M-SEARCH packet containing malicious commands within the ST field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router and be able to send requests to the UPnP port.
- The attacker can be anyone with network access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware versions are 2.06 and 2.06.B09_BETA.
- The suggested mitigation involves employing a blacklist approach to filter out command injection payloads such as `;`, `||`, etc.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the ACE Team at Loginsoft.
- D-Link has classified this device as End-of-Life/End-of-Support, and is recommending users retire and replace the device instead of patching it.
