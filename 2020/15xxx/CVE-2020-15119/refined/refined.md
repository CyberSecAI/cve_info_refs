Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the `auth0-lock` library to display user-provided input, specifically:
   -  Email/phone number input during Passwordless authentication.
   -  IdP domain input from the Enterprise connection setup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The direct rendering of user-controlled data without proper sanitization into the HTML document via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` introduces an XSS vulnerability.
* **Insecure Input Handling:** The application does not sufficiently sanitize or encode the input received from the user or the Auth0 dashboard before displaying it in the Lock widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the user input fields. When the Lock widget renders this data, the script would execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
* Steal sensitive information such as session cookies or tokens.
* Redirect the user to malicious websites.
* Modify the content of the page displayed to the user.
* Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Passwordless Connection:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the email or phone number input field during the initial phase of the passwordless login.
* **Enterprise Connection:** The attacker could inject malicious Javascript into the IdP domain field in the Auth0 dashboard. This will be displayed to the user when the lock widget opens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to either control the input fields in the Auth0 Dashboard (for Enterprise connections) or be able to input malicious code when initiating the passwordless login process.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in versions of `auth0-lock` up to and including 11.25.1.
* The fix is available in version 11.26.3, which addresses the issue.
* The vulnerability is classified as low severity due to the reliance on specific configurations (Passwordless or Enterprise connections) and the user's interaction with the Auth0 lock widget.
* The reported is mvisat.
