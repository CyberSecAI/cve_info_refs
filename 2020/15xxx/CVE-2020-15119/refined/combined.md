# DOM-based XSS in Lock

Low

[lzychowski](/lzychowski)
published
GHSA-6gg3-pmm7-97xc
Aug 17, 2020

## Package

npm

auth0-lock
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 11.25.1

## Patched versions

11.26.3

## Description

### Overview

Versions before and including `11.25.1` are using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to display an informational message when used with a Passwordless or Enterprise connection.

* For Passwordless connection, the value of the input (email or phone number) is displayed back to the user while waiting for verification code input.
* For Enterprise connection, the value of the input (IdP Domain) from the Enterprise connection setup screen (Auth0 Dashboard) is displayed back to the user when the `lock` widget opens.

When Passwordless or Enterprise connection is used, the application and its users might be exposed to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

* You are using auth0-lock
* You are using Passwordless or Enterprise connection mode

### How to fix that?

Upgrade to version `11.26.3`

### Will this update impact my users?

The fix provided in patch will not affect your users.

### Credit

<https://github.com/mvisat>

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15119

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
