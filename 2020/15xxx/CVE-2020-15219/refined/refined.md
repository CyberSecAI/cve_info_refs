Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-15219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability occurs when a download error is triggered in the user portal of iTop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is that the system inadvertently displays the underlying SQL query to the user when a download error occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker or a regular user who triggers a download error can potentially gain insight into the structure and logic of the SQL database. This could reveal sensitive information including table names, column names, and potentially data filtering logic.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** The leaked SQL query details can be used to craft more sophisticated attacks that may lead to other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-Initiated Action:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to download something through the portal and a download error occurs.
- **Error manipulation:** An attacker might be able to deliberately cause such errors, to expose the underlying SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user who has access to the iTop portal. No special privileges are needed.
- The user needs the ability to trigger a download error in the portal, either by accident or by deliberately manipulating the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is considered "moderate" in severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in iTop versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
- The report credits Cyblex Technologies for discovering and reporting the issue.
