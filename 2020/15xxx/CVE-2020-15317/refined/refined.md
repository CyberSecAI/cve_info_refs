Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15317:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly mentions "Hardcoded SSH server keys - CVE-2020-15312, CVE-2020-15313, CVE-2020-15314, CVE-2020-15315, CVE-2020-15316, CVE-2020-15317, CVE-2020-15318, CVE-2020-15319". This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the use of hardcoded SSH server keys within the Zyxel CNM SecuManager appliance. These keys are used for the main host as well as chrooted environments (Axess and mysql).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Hardcoded SSH Keys:** The same private SSH keys are used across all installations of the software, which means if an attacker obtains these keys, they can use them to impersonate the SSH server.
    *   **Insecure Permissions:** The private SSH keys have world-readable permissions (644), allowing any user on the system to read them.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker with the hardcoded private keys can perform MITM attacks on SSH connections to the appliance, decrypting the encrypted traffic and potentially gaining access to sensitive information like credentials.
    *   **Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate the SSH server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** An attacker positioned on the network between a client and the Zyxel appliance can intercept SSH traffic and use the hardcoded keys to decrypt it.
    *   **Local access:** An attacker with local access to the appliance can simply read the private keys from the file system due to the insecure permissions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between a client and the vulnerable Zyxel appliance or obtain local access to the appliance.
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the hardcoded private SSH keys, which are world-readable, or by doing an MITM attack using the hardcoded keys.

**Additional Technical Details (beyond the standard CVE description):**

*   The advisory provides the specific hardcoded private keys for DSA, ECDSA and RSA algorithms used for the main host, "Axess" chroot and "mysql" chroot, along with their corresponding fingerprints.
*   The advisory specifies the location of the keys within the file system.
*   It notes that the permissions on the private keys are world readable.
*   It details that the `secu_manager` user is also vulnerable to MITM attacks.

In summary, CVE-2020-15317 describes the vulnerability of hardcoded SSH keys which, combined with weak permissions, allow for man-in-the-middle attacks and impersonation.
