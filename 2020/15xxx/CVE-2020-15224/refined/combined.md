# Changelog

Major work such as new features, bug fixes, feature deprecations, and other
breaking changes should be noted here. It should be more concise than `git log`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.19.0...HEAD)

### Security

* Updated mbedtls from version 2.28.1 to 2.28.9

### Added

* (#4832) OE SDK now accepts environment variable `OE_INTEL_QVL_LOAD_POLICY`, which can be used to specify the policy for loading [Intel DCAP's QvE](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives) (Quote Verification) for SGX/TDX quote verification. The value can be one of the following:
  + `SGX_QL_EPHEMERAL` and `SGX_QL_DEFAULT` - Default policy. QvE is initialized and terminated on every quote verification function call.
  + `SGX_QL_PERSISTENT` - All the threads will share single QvE instance, and QvE is initialized on first use and reused until process ends.
  + `SGX_QL_EPHEMERAL_QVE_MULTI_THREAD` - QvE is loaded per thread and be unloaded before function exit.
  + `SGX_QL_PERSISTENT_QVE_MULTI_THREAD` - QvE is loaded per thread and only be unloaded before thread exit.

## [v0.19.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.18.5...v0.19.0)

### Added

* OE SDK can now be built with Clang-11 and it is recommended to upgrade the compiler to Clang-11 if you are building the SDK from source.

  + Building OE SDK enclaves now includes the following LVI mitigation options:
    - `ControlFlow-GNU` - enables LVI mitigation using the existing GNU-based mitigation specified by `LVI_MITIGATION_BINDIR`. This option is recommended when building OE SDK with Clang-10.
    - `ControlFlow-Clang` - enables Clang-based LVI mitigations. Choosing this option requires Clang-11.
    - `ControlFlow` - enables LVI mitigation but default to the recommended method, which is currently ControlFlow-GNU.
    - `None` - no LVI mitigations are enabled.
    - *Note*: The packages released in 0.19.0 are built with ControlFlow-GNU mitigations
* Added a TDX verifier plugin based on Intel QVL/QvE

  + Added two public APIs to initialize and shut down
    the plugin defined in the `openenclave/attestation/tdx/evidence.h`
    - `oe_tdx_verifier_initialize()`
    - `oe_tdx_verifier_shutdown()`
  + Added a new format uuid for TDX quote `OE_FORMAT_UUID_TDX_QUOTE_ECDSA`
  + Added a new OCALL `oe_verify_tdx_quote_ocall` that is
    used by the plugin internally (see `openenclave/edl/sgx/tdx_verification.edl`)
  + Steps for verify a TDX quote
    1. Initialize the plugin via `oe_tdx_verifier_initialize`
    2. Invoke `oe_verify_evidence` by specifying the quote and
       format id as `OE_FORMAT_UUID_TDX_QUOTE_ECDSA`
    3. Parse the claims (refer the definitions of TDX claims
       to `openenclave/attestation/evidence.h`)
  + Note that the `oe_verify_evidence` with the plugin currently
    does not support input endorsements (must be `NULL`)
* Added two APIs `oe_get_tdx_endorsements` and `oe_free_tdx_endorsements` to fetch
  and free the endorsements for the given TDX quote. The APIs are for users who want
  to manage (e.g., caching) the endorsements by themselves instead of relying on the
  existing caching mechanisms (e.g., supported by DCAP).
  See `openenclave/attestation/tdx/evidence.h` for more detail of the APIs.
* Added support for V4 collateral from Intel for SGX and TDX

### Changed

* snmalloc (0.6.0) now only requires 16KiB initially per thread, compared to 256 KiB previously (0.5.3). Thread-local heaps only grow by a constant amount until the next power of 2, eg. 16KiB, 16KiB, 32KiB, 64KiB, ... 1MiB, 2MiB, 2MiB, ..., as opposed to a fixed amount previously (256 KiB). Allocator metadata is kept separately, making corruption attacks less likely. There are some applications for which this update in snmalloc will result in an increase in EPC memory as specified in the enclave configuration file.
* Open Enclave SDK is no longer tested on Ubuntu 18.04. Ubuntu 18.04 is at EOL. v0.19.0 will not contain packages for Ubuntu 18.04.

## [v0.18.5](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.18.4...v0.18.5)

### Security

* Updated OpenSSL used inside the enclave to v1.1.1t. See [OpenSSL's release notes](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html) for more details

## [v0.18.4](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.18.2...v0.18.4)

### Added

* Added oe\_set\_host\_log\_level and oe\_set\_enclave\_log\_level APIs to dynamically modify host and enclave log level verbosity, respectively. See #4610 for more details
* Added backtrace debug log for unhandled exceptions if the enclave is configured with and CapturePFGPExceptions=1, the backtrace information will be printed in the enclave log when an in-enclave exception is not handled by trusted handlers. If the enclave is not configured with CapturePFGPExceptions=1, the similar helper message in the following will be printed in the log: `2022-07-13T00:25:05+0000.276579Z (H)ERROR] tid(0x7f6cbb2b1f40) | Unhandled in-enclave exception. To get more information, configure the enclave with CapturePFGPExceptions=1 and enable the in-enclave logging.`

### Changed

* Fixed bugs in oe\_validate\_revocation\_list regarding PCCS API v3.0
* Fixed issue where oe\_hex\_dump prints data to stdout, even when logging callback is set
* Fixed the issue where enclave stack was not showing up in ocall callstack in Windows debuggers. Added padding to restore offset of callsites field to previous value.

### Security

* Updated OpenSSL used inside the enclave to v1.1.1q. See [OpenSSL's release notes](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html) for more details
* Update Mbed-TLS used inside the enclave to 2.28.1. See [Mbed-TLS's release notes](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.28.1) for more details.

## [v0.18.2](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.18.1...v0.18.2)

### Changed

* Fixed the incorrect behavior of pthread\_mutex\_init() and std::mutex such that they no longer create a recursive lock by default. Please see issue #4555 for more details.

### Security

* Mitigated CVE-2022-21233. Please refer to the [security advisory](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/security/advisories/GHSA-v3vm-9h66-wm76) for the same.
  - The mitigations require an extra copy for ocalls in oeedger8r generated code.
  - If you are running on a processor that is not affected by the CVE, you can turn off oeedger8r introduced mitigations by defining a global C variable `bool oe_edger8r_secure_unserialize = false;` in enclave side code.

### Deprecated

* Ubuntu 18.04 has reached end of support, and will no longer be supported.

## [v0.18.1](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.18.0...v0.18.1)

### Changed

* Calling oe\_log from an enclave resulted in partial log output. #4547 fixed this.
* Fixed #4540. The fix **does not** introduce functional changes, but updates `memcpy_with_barrier` such that the source address will be always aligned when the function does 2- or 4-byte memory write.
* Fixed #4542. The issue affects only those applications that ignore `SIGHUP`, `SIGALRM`, `SIGPIPE`, `SIGPOLL`, `SIGUSR1`, or`SIGUSR2` using `signal(signum, SIG_IGN)` on Linux. The issue has **no impact** on the enclave runtime.

## [v0.18.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.17.7...v0.18.0)

### Added

* `oeapkman` is a Linux tool for installing and using Alpine Linux static libraries within enclaves.
  + The command `oeapkman add package` can be used to install the specified package.
    Typically `-static` and `-dev` (e.g.: sqlite-static, sqlite-dev) packages need to be installed.
  + The command `oeapkman root` prints out the path to the Alpine Linux distribution maintained by `oeapkman`.
    The root path is useful for providing paths to header files and static libraries to the compiler and linker respectively.
  + The command `oeapkman exec` can be used to execute commands within the Alpine Linux environment.
    For example, after executing `oeapkman add clang build-base cmake` to install development tools,
    running `oeapkman exec clang -c file.c` would compile `file.c` in current folder using the clang compiler that
    has been installed in the Alpine Linux environment. `oeapkman exec bash` would launch a bash shell in the current folder.
  + The `--optee` prefix can be applied to the commands to target OP-TEE.
    `oeapkman --optee add sqlite-static` installs aarch64 sqlite static library.
    `oeapkman --optee exec gcc -c file.c` cross-compile `file.c` to target OP-TEE.
  + See [samples/apkman](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/apkman) for a complete example demonstrating use of the `sqlite` database library within enclaves.
* Support for `compiler-rt`. `oelibc` includes LLVM's `compiler-rt-10.0.1`.
* Update logging function setup API name for SGX Quote Provider plugin to `sgx_ql_set_logging_callback` and mark API name `sgx_ql_set_logging_function` as deprecated.
* Add new policy type `OE_POLICY_ENDORSEMENTS_BASELINE` for `oe_verify_evidence` API to pass additional parameters to QVL for more advanced quote validation.
* The CapturePFGPExceptions preference is now supported in SGX1 debug mode on Linux.
  + When setting CapturePFGPExceptions=1, OE will simulate all the SIGSEGV as #PF by forwarding the host information (faulting address) to in-enclave exception handlers.
  + Note that this feature is for debug only and there is no guarantee that the simulated behavior works the same as the hardware feature in SGX2.
* Added the support of using vDSO interfaces for SGX enclaves on Linux to enable synchronous exception handling. The `oehost` library automatically opts into the vDSO interface when it is available (Linux kernel 5.11+).

## Changed

* Updated libcxx to version 10.0.1
* Updated the mbedTLS from 2.16 LTS to 2.28 LTS
* Updated the SymCrypt-OpenSSL to v1.1.0
* Updated the support of the SymCrypt module to v101.3.0

### Security

* Updated openssl to version 1.1.1o. Please refer to [release notes](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html) to find CVEs addressed by this version.

## [v0.17.7](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.17.6...v0.17.7)

### Changed

* Increased the value of maximum TCS from 32 to 1000, allowing SGX applications to create more threads.

### Security

* Updated openssl to version 1.1.1n. Please refer to [release notes](https://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.1.1-notes.html) to find CVEs addressed by this version.

## [v0.17.6](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.17.5...v0.17.6)

### Added

* Added support FIPS-enabled OpenSSL based on [SymCrypt](https://github.com/Microsoft/SymCrypt).
  + Add a new library `oesymcryptengine`, which is a customized build of [SymCrypt OpenSSL engine](https://github.com/Microsoft/SymCrypt-OpenSSL).
  + To use FIPS-enabled OpenSSL with SymCrypt, users need to link their enclave against
    both `oesymcryptengine` and `libsymcrypt.so` (part of [SymCrypt](https://github.com/Microsoft/SymCrypt) release packages) in addition to OpenSSL libraries, and include `entropy.edl` in the edl file. Note that `libsymcrypt.so` needs to be placed under the same directory with the enclave binary.
  + See the [attested\_tls sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/attested_tls#build-and-run) for an example of building enclaves with FIPS-enabled OpenSSL based on SymCrypt (set `OE_CRYPTO_LIB` to `openssl_symcrypt_fips`).
* Added support for POSIX mmap and munmap.
* Enabled MUSL conf functions.
* Added callback option to capture and modify enclave logs.

### Security

* Update mbedTLS to version 2.16.12. Refer to the [2.16.12](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.16.12) release notes for the set of issues addressed.
* Note: 2.16 LTS is at End Of Life. mbedTLS libs included with the Open Enclave SDK will move to use the 2.28 LTS branch in the next release. 2.28.0 has certain breaking changes. To understand how these changes will impact your application, please refer to the release notes for [2.28.0](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.28.0).

## [v0.17.5](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.17.2...v0.17.5)

### Added

* Added MUSL time functions
  asctime, asctime\_r, ctime, ctime\_r, ftime, localtime, localtime\_r, strptime, timespec\_get, wcsftime.

### Changed

* Fixed bug with incorrect layout of thread-local sections (tbss and tdata). Previous releases of OE had a bug where these sections
  will be laid out incorrectly in some cases where the tbss section had a lower alignment value than tdata section.
* OpenSSL is now built with threads support (with the dependency on the host). Note that the previous versions of OpenSSL are not suitable for multi-threaded applications.

### Security

* Updated openssl to version 1.1.1l. Please refer to release log to find list of CVEs addressed by this version.

## [v0.17.2](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.17.1...v0.17.2)

### Security

* Updated openssl to version 1.1.1l. Please refer to release log to find list of CVEs addressed by this version.

## [v0.17.1](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.17.0...v0.17.1)

### Added

* Enabled creation of enclaves with base address 0x0 in SGX on Linux.
  + This feature requires PSW version 2.14.1 or above.
  + In 0-base enclaves a page fault is thrown on NULL pointer dereference.
  + This enables applications to adopt NullPointerException/ NullReferenceException in their program logic and/or use other application stacks that do (Example, .NET runtime).
  + Developers can create an 0-base enclave by setting the oesign tool configuration option 'CreateZeroBaseEnclave' to 1 or by passing in argument CREATE\_ZERO\_BASE\_ENCLAVE=1 in OE\_SET\_ENCLAVE\_SGX2().
  + If the 0-base enclave creation is chosen, enclave image start address should be provided by setting the oesign tool configuration option 'StartAddress' or pass in the argument ENCLAVE\_START\_ADDRESS in OE\_SET\_ENCLAVE\_SGX2().

### Security

* Fix [CVE-2021-33767](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/security/advisories/GHSA-mj87-466f-jq42)

## [v0.17.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.16.1...v0.17.0)

### Added

* Ubuntu 20.04 packages are included in this release.
* OE SDK is now built using clang-10. It is required to upgrade the compiler to clang-10 if you are building the SDK from source.
* Add the CapturePFGPExceptions preference for the SGX2 feature of capturing #PF and #GP exceptions inside an enclave.
  + Developers can specify the CapturePFGPExceptions with a binary value in the enclave config file or set the value via the newly added OE\_SET\_ENCLAVE\_SGX2 macro, which is used to set SGX2-specific properties.
  + When setting CapturePFGPExceptions=1, the OE loader will enable the feature when running on an SGX2-capable CPU.
  + Once enabled, the in-enclave exception handler can capture the #PF (with the OE\_EXCEPTION\_PAGE\_FAULT code) and #GP (with the code OE\_EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION code) exceptions.
  + More information about the exceptions can be found in the `faulting_address` and `error_code` members of the `oe_exception_record_t` structure passed into the handler.
* Add the following attestation claims from oe\_verify\_evidence():
  + OE\_CLAIM\_TCB\_STATUS
  + OE\_CLAIM\_TCB\_DATE
* Publish tool `oeutil`.
  + The tool, currently under the tools directory, will [integrate multiple OE utilities](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/tools/oeutil/README.md) in the future.
  + The tool integrated `oegenerate` in this release.
* SGX enclaves created using OE SDK can now be debugged using `oelldb`.
  `oelldb` is a python based extension for LLDB that supports debugging SGX enclaves. lldb-7 or above is required.
* SGX Evidence verification stops checking SGX QEIdentity nextUpdate field.

### Deprecated

* The `Release` build type for building the Open Enclave SDK from source is deprecated. The recommendation is using `RelWithDebInfo` instead.

## [v0.16.1](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.16.0...v0.16.1)

### Added

* Add the support for SGX quote verification collateral version 3 with the CRL in DER format by default. Refer to [Get Quote Verification Collateral](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.10/linux/docs/Intel_SGX_ECDSA_QuoteLibReference_DCAP_API.pdf) section 3.3.1.5.

## [v0.16.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.15.0...v0.16.0)

### Added

* Add the initial support of cryptographic module loading in SGX enclaves. Refer to the [design document](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/CryptoModuleLoadingSupport.md) for more detail.
* Add the support of getrandom libc API and syscall in enclaves.
* Add `libsgx-quote-ex`, `sgx-aesm-service` and several SGX AESM plugins to Ansible scripts so that users will be able to select in-process or out-of-process call path for quote generation. Refer to the [attestation sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/attestation/README.md#determining-call-path-for-sgx-quote-generation) for more information.
* Open Enclave SDK installation on Linux sets the environment variable "SGX\_AESM\_ADDR" to 1 to enable attestation quote generation to occur out of the application process.
* Add the support of the OE\_ENCLAVE\_FLAG\_DEBUG\_AUTO flag to the oe\_create\_enclave API. When the flag is set and the OE\_ENCLAVE\_FLAG\_DEBUG flag is cleared, the debug mode is automatically turned on/off based on the value of Debug specified in the enclave config file.
* Publish test tool `oegenerate`.
  + The tool, currently under the tools directory, was originally named oecert under the tests/tools directory.
  + The tool can be used to generate certificates, reports, and evidence in various formats.
  + The tool is for debugging purposes and is not suitable for production use.
* Full support for SGX KSS (Key Separation and Sharing) including
  + FamilyID and ExtendedProductionID in enclave configuration file. Refer to [Build and Sign an Enclave](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/buildandsign.md) for more information.
  + config\_id and config\_svn at enclave loading time. Refer to [Open Enclave Init-time Configuration Interface](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/InitTimeConfigurationInterface.md) for more information.

### Changed

* The OpenEnclave CMake configuration now explicitly sets CMAKE\_SKIP\_RPATH to TRUE. This change should not affect fully static-linked enclaves.
* oe\_verify\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence() has been considered insufficient for security and deprecated, because it does not allow users to pass in optional endorsements and policies. Use the new, experimental oe\_verify\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence\_v2() instead to generate a self-signed certificate for use in the TLS handshaking process.
  + Refer to the [issue](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/issues/3820) and the [proposed attestation API requirements](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/AttestationApiRequirements.md) for more details.
* In/out parameters in EDL now have the default count equals to one if the `count` attribute is not used.
* Improved attestation evidence verification performance.
* Open Enclave SDK will be built with clang-10 starting v0.17.0 release. We had originally planned to upgrade to clang-10 in the v0.16.0 release, but ran into some issues. We recommend that developers move to clang-10 starting v0.17.0 release.

### Security

* Update MUSL to version 1.2.2. Refer to MUSL release notes between version 1.1.22 to 1.2.2 for the set of issues addressed.

## [v0.15.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.14.0...v0.15.0)

### Added

* Oeedger8r now supports the warning flag -W. The available options include:
  + -Wreturn-ptr: Check if an OCALL or ECALL returns a pointer.
  + -Wptr-in-struct: Check if a user-defined struct includes a un-annotated pointer member.
  + -Wforeign-type-ptr: Check if an OCALL or ECALL includes a parameter that is the pointer of a foreign type.
  + -Wptr-in-function: Check if an OCALL or ECALL includes a un-annotated pointer argument.
  + -Wall: Enable all the warning options.
  + -Wno-: Disable the corresponding warning.
  + -Werror: Turn warnings into errors.
  + -Werror=: Turn the specified warning into an error.
* oesign sign now allows option -o/--output-file, to specify location to write signature of enclave image.
* Debugger Contract has been extended to support multiple modules.
  + Refer to [design document](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/DebuggerSupportForMultiModuleEnclaves.md) for details.

### Changed

* oe\_get\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence() has been considered insufficient for security and deprecated, because it does not allow users to pass in a provided nonce or additional customized information. Use the new, experimental oe\_get\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence\_v2() instead to generate a self-signed certificate for use in the TLS handshaking process.
  + Refer to the [issue](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/issues/3820) and the [proposed attestation API requirements](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/AttestationApiRequirements.md#getevidence-call) for more details.
* Debugger Contract
  + `path` fields in `oe_debug_enclave_t` and `oe_debug_module_t` are now defined to be in
    UTF-8 encoding. Previously the encoding was undefined. To ensure smooth transition, debuggers
    are required to try out both UTF-8 as well as the previous encoding and pick the one that works.

### Security

* Update mbedTLS to version 2.16.10. Refer to the [2.16.10](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.16.10) and [2.16.9](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.16.9) release notes for the set of issues addressed.
* OPENSSL is updated to version 1.1.1k.

## [v0.14.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0)

### Added

* Add the deep-copy out parameter support as an experimental, SGX-only feature. To use the feature, pass `--experimental` when invoking oeedger8r. Refer to the [design document](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/DeepCopyOutParameters.md) for more detail.

### Changed

* OE SDK is now built using clang-8. It is required to upgrade the compile to clang-8 if you are building the SDK from source.

### Deprecated

* The support of building the SDK for Intel SGX with GCC from source is no longer supported. The recommended compiler is Clang.

## [v0.13.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0)

### Added

* OpenSSL version 1.1.1 libraries are now available for an enclave to use. See the [attested\_tls sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/attested_tls#build-and-run) for an example of building enclaves with OpenSSL.
* Enabled oe\_verify\_evidence() with a NULL format id to verify the legacy report generated by oe\_get\_report().
* Added the following SGX attestation claims from oe\_verify\_evidence():
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_PF\_GP\_EXINFO\_ENABLED
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_ISV\_EXTENDED\_PRODUCT\_ID
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_IS\_MODE64BIT
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_HAS\_PROVISION\_KEY
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_HAS\_EINITTOKEN\_KEY
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_USES\_KSS
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_CONFIG\_ID
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_CONFIG\_SVN
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_ISV\_FAMILY\_ID
* Added the following fields for SGX KSS (Key Separation and Sharing) support:
  + FamilyID
  + ExtendedProductID

## Breaking Changes

* liboecryptombed is now called liboecryptombedtls and will no longer be automatically included as a link dependency when linking liboeenclave in CMake.
  + The `openenclave-config.cmake` and `openenclave-lvi-mitigation-config.cmake` will not specify the renamed liboecryptombedtls as a `PUBLIC` link requirement for liboeenclave.
  + Enclave apps that are built with CMake and use the Open Enclave's CMake configurations must now explicitly include OE crypto wrapper library when linking `openenclave::oeenclave`.
  + See the [CMakeLists.txt in the helloworld sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/helloworld/enclave/CMakeLists.txt#L32) for an example. Here `OE_CRYPTO_LIB` is set to `mbedtls` in [parent CMakeList file](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/helloworld/CMakeLists.txt#L22).
  + Enclave apps that are built with Make and rely on Open Enclave's pkgconfig must now explicitly include OE crypto wrapper library in linker dependency flags.
  + See the [Makefile in the helloworld sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/helloworld/enclave/Makefile#L34) for an example. Here `OE_CRYPTO_LIB` is set to `mbedtls` in [parent MakeList file](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/helloworld/Makefile#L9).

### Changed

* Syscalls are internally dispatched directly to their implementation functions instead of via a switch-case.
  This allows the linker to eliminate unused syscalls, leading to slightly reduced TCB.
  The command `objdump -t enclave-filename | grep oe_SYS_` can be used to figure out the list of syscalls invoked by
  code within the enclave. While most syscall implementations make OCALLs, some may be implemented entirely within
  the enclave or may be noops (e.g SYS\_futex).
* Changed the attestation evidence extension OIDs for certificates generated by the following APIs. Verifiers must call oe\_verify\_attestation\_certificate APIs from v.0.11.0 or above.
  + oe\_generate\_attestation\_certificate(): "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.105.1"
  + oe\_get\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidnece(): "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.105.2"

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0)

### Added

* Initial implementation of the [Malloc Info API](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/Mallinfo.md) for dlmalloc (default allocator), and snmalloc.
* Added missing attribute validations to oeedger8r C++ implementation.
* Added new API *oe\_log\_message*. See [design doc](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/oe_log_message%28%29_callback_proposal.md) and [sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/log_callback/README.md).
* Added APIs and a library for developers to detect leaks in enclaves. See [design doc](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/Enabledebugmalloc.md) and [sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/debugmalloc/README.md).
* Added support of QVL/QVE based SGX evidence verification, as described in [design doc](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/SGX_QuoteVerify_Integration.md).
* Added a new oeverify tool that subsumes the existing host\_verify sample which was installed as part of the host verify package.
  It is basically the same utility as host\_verify with added flexibility to pass a custom format for the evidence to be verified.

### Changed

* Fixed [#3543](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/issues/3543), updated openenclaverc file and documents on Windows to avoid overwriting CMAKE\_PREFIX\_PATH.
* The local and remote attestation samples are merged into a [single sample](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/samples/attestation/README.md).
* Disabled a set of OpenSSL APIs/macros that are considered as unsafe based on OE's threat model.
  More specifically, those APIs allow users to configure an OpenSSL application to read certificates from the host filesystem, which is not trusted, and therefore not recommended for use in enclaves. [OpenSSLSupport.md](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/OpenSSLSupport.md) has been updated to reflect the changes.

### Deprecated

* The Open Enclave SDK will be dropping support for Ubuntu 16.04 after Dec 2020.
  Developers and partners using Ubuntu 16.04 will need to move to using Ubuntu 18.04 by then.
  [#3625](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/issues/3625) tracks this.
* The Open Enclave SDK will be dropping support for WS2016 after Dec 2020.
  Developers and partners using WS2016 will need to move to using WS2019 by then.
  [#3539](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/issues/3539) tracks this.
* The Open Enclave SDK is deprecating support for gcc while *building the SDK from source* after Dec 2020.
  The recommended compiler while building the SDK from source is Clang.
  [#3555](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/issues/3555) tracks this.

### Security

* Security fixes in oeedger8r
  + Fix TOCTOU vulnerability in NULL terminator checks for ocall in/out string parameters.
  + Count/size properties in deep-copied in/out structs are treated as read-only to prevent the host
    from changing corrupting enclave memory by changing these properties.
* Fixed [Socket syscalls can leak enclave memory contents](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/security/advisories/GHSA-525h-wxcc-f66m) (CVE-2020-15224).

## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0)

### Added

* Open Enclave SDK release packages can now be built on non-SGX and non-FLC machines.
* Support for arbitrarily large thread-local data for SGX machines.
* Experimental support for OpenSSL inside enclaves has been added while building the SDK from source.
  + Use BUILD\_OPENSSL flag while compiling the SDK.
  + [OpenSSLSupport.md](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/OpenSSLSupport.md) documents supported options and configuration needed to use OpenSSL inside an enclave.
* Custom claims buffer serialization/de-serialization helper functions.
* oe\_verify\_evidence() and oe\_verify\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence() have been added to the host-verify package.
* SGX attestation endorsement claims from oe\_verify\_evidence() will contain the following:
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_TCB\_INFO
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_TCB\_ISSUER\_CHAIN
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_PCK\_CRL
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_ROOT\_CA\_CRL
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_CRL\_ISSUER\_CHAIN
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_QE\_ID\_INFO
  + OE\_CLAIM\_SGX\_QE\_ID\_ISSUER\_CHAIN
* The attestation functions in local\_attestation/remote\_attestation/attested\_tls/host\_verify samples now use attestation plugin APIs, defined in attestation/attester.h and attestation/verifier.h to generate and verify evidence.
* oe\_get\_evidence() support for generation of SGX EPID evidences, in formats OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_EPID\_LINKABLE and OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_EPID\_UNLINKABLE.

### Changed

* Rename the custom claims buffer added by oe\_get\_evidence from "custom\_claims" to "custom\_claims\_buffer". Likewise, replace the `OE_CLAIM_CUSTOM_CLAIMS` definition for this name with `OE_CLAIM_CUSTOM_CLAIMS_BUFFER`.
* Building SDK from source
  - HAS\_QUOTE\_PROVIDER cmake option has been removed. This is a continuation of the work in the previous release to allow the same build of OE SDK to run on both FLC and non-FLC machines.
  - Intel SGX EnclaveCommonAPI packages are no longer needed to build the SDK.
* oe\_verify\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence() can now verify certificates generated by oe\_generate\_attestation\_certificate() as well as oe\_get\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence().
* The SGX attestation evidence internal structure has changed. The current structure (version 3) is not compatible with the previous version. Evidence/certificates generated prior to v0.11.0 cannot be verified by v0.11.0 verifiers. Applications that call the following experimental APIs must link to OE SDK v0.11.0 or above:
  + oe\_get\_evidence()
  + oe\_verify\_evidence()
  + oe\_get\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence()
  + oe\_verify\_attestation\_certificate\_with\_evidence()
* Some SGX attestation format IDs have been renamed:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_ECDSA\_P256 | OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_ECDSA |
| OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_ECDSA\_P256\_REPORT | OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_LEGACY\_REPORT\_REMOTE |
| OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_ECDSA\_P256\_QUOTE | OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_RAW\_SGX\_QUOTE\_ECDSA |

### Removed

* COMPILE\_SYSTEM\_EDL option while building the SDK from source has been removed.
* Declaration of SGX format ID OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_ECDSA\_P384 is removed.
* oe\_get\_evidence() support of SGX legacy formats OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_ECDSA\_P256\_REPORT and OE\_FORMAT\_UUID\_SGX\_ECDSA\_P256\_QUOTE is removed.

### Security

* Update mbedTLS to version 2.16.8. Refer to the [2.16.7](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.16.7)
  and [2.16.8](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.16.8) release notes for the set of issues addressed.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0)

### Added

* Added `oe_sgx_get_signer_id_from_public_key()` function which helps a verifier of SGX reports extract the expected MRSIGNER value from the signer's public key PEM certificate.
* OE SDK can now be built and run in simulation mode on a non SGX x64 Windows machine by passing HAS\_QUOTE\_PROVIDER=off.
  Previously, the build would work, but running applications would fail due to missing sgx\_enclave\_common.dll.
* OE SDK can now be installed from published packages on SGX machines without FLC, and non-SGX machines.
  Previously, OE SDK could only be installed on SGX1 FLC machines due to a link-time dependency on sgx\_dcap\_ql which
  was available only on SGX1 FLC machines.
* oesign tool supports the new `digest` command and options for [2-step signing using the digest](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/oesign_digest_signing_support.md).
* Oeedger8r now supports the --use-prefix feature.
* Oeedger8r now supports a subset of C-style preprocessor directives (#ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif).
* The default memory allocator (dlmalloc) can be replaced by providing replacement functions. This ability to plug-in
  a custom allocator is most applicable for multi-threaded enclaves with memory allocation patterns where the default
  memory allocator may not be performant. See [Pluggable Allocators](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/Pluggableallocators.md).
* `snmalloc` is available as a pluggable allocator library `oesnmalloc`. An enclave can use snmalloc instead of
  dlmalloc by specifying `liboesnmalloc.a` before `liboelibc.a` and `liboecore.a` in the linker line.
* Added pluggable\_allocator sample.
* Gcov is used to obtain code coverage information for the SDK. See [Code Coverage](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/Contributors/CodeCoverage.md).
* Added include\openenclave\attestation\attester.h to support attestation plug-in model attester scenarios.
* Added include\openenclave\attestation\verifier.h to support attestation plug-in model verifier scenarios.

### Changed

* `COMPILE_SYSTEM_EDL` is now OFF by default, meaning system EDL must be imported by
  application EDL. See [system EDL opt-in document](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/system_ocall_opt_in.md#how-to-port-your-application) for more information.
  + Note: SDK users would need to import logging.edl to enable logging. Logging is disabled by default.
  + See [System edls](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/SystemEdls.md) for list of all edls and associated OCalls.
  + A known issue is that different enclaves importing functions from System EDLs cannot be loaded by the same host app unless all of the functions were imported with exactly the same ordinals. See #3250 for details. This will be addressed in the next release based on design proposal #3086.
  + A workaround for this issue in the meantime is to define a standard import EDL for any enclaves that need to be loaded into the same host app. Ensuring this shared EDL is then the first import in each enclave's EDL will result in the common imports being assigned the same ordinals in each resulting enclave.
* Mark APIs in include/openenclave/attestation/sgx/attester.h and verifier.h as experimental.
* Remove CRL\_ISSUER\_CHAIN\_PCK\_PROC\_CA field from endorsement struct define in include/openenclave/bits/attestation.h.
* Switch to oeedger8r written in C++.
* Fix #3143. oesign tool will now reject .conf files that contain duplicate property definitions.
* SGX Simulation Mode does not need SGX libraries to be present in the system.
* oehost library dynamically loads sgx\_dcap\_ql shared library instead of linking against it. This allows the SDK to
  be installed on non-FLC and non-SGX machines.
* Fix #3134. ParseSGXExtensions will now correctly parse the SGX extensions for PCK Certificates defined in [SGX spec](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/dcap-latest/linux/docs/Intel_SGX_PCK_Certificate_CRL_Spec-1.4.pdf).
* oesign `dump` command now also displays the `MRSIGNER` value of an SGX enclave signature if it exists.
* The Deep-copy feature of oeedger8r is now enabled by default.
* The oeedger8r-generated header files now contain only the function prototypes. Marshalling structs, function id enums,
  and function tables are generated only in the c files.
* Docs and scripts updated to use Azure DCAP client v1.6.0.
* Fix #2930. Fixes the logic of detecting compilers when LVI mitigation is enabled. That is, the old logic always picks clang-7 (if installed) regardless of whether the environment variable CC is set to gcc.
* Fix #2670. This fix also allows users to specify the version of clang (default is clang-7) when building the helloworld sample with LVI mitigation.
* Fix #3056. oe\_is\_within\_enclave() and oe\_is\_outside\_enclave() now reflect the SGX enclave boundary as determined by the enclave SECS rather than the limit of the pages initially provisioned in to the enclave.
* If not specified, CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE is set to Debug. This ensures that cmake and cmake -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug result in the same build configuration.
* Moved include/openenclave/attestation/plugin.h to internal. Currently only support internal attestation plugin registration.
* Parameter *flags* is removed from experimental function oe\_get\_evidence(). Use 'evidence\_format' parameter to select evidence format.

### Removed

* Removed oehostapp and the appendent "-rdynamic" compiling option. Please use oehost instead and add the option back manually if necessary.
* Removed dependencies on nodejs and esy, which were previously used to build Ocaml compiler and oeedger8r.

### Security

* Fix [ABI poisoning vulnerability for x87 FPU operations in enclaves](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/security/advisories/GHSA-7wjx-wcwg-w999).

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.8.2...v0.9.0)

### Added

* Complete support for inttypes.h and stdlib.h in oelibc. See docs/LibcSupport.md for more details.
* Support for Simulation Mode on Windows. Simulation mode only runs on systems with SGX enabled.
* Support `transition_using_threads` EDL attribute for ecalls in oeedger8r.
  OE SDK now supports both switchless OCALLs and ECALLs.
* Published corelibc headers required by oeedger8r-generated code.
  **Disclaimer:** these headers do not make any guarantees about stability. They
  are intended to be used by generated code and are not part of the OE public
  API surface.
* Support for Windows Server 2019.
* Experimental support for RHEL8.
* Preview versions of VSCode and Visual Studio Extensions for OE are now part of the github repo.
* Experimental support for enclave file system APIs on Windows host.
* oelibcxx now supports up to `std=c++17`. Please see docs/LibcxxSupport.md for more details.
* `COMPILE_SYSTEM_EDL` build flag. This is on by default and will compile system
  OCalls and ECalls into OE libraries as before. If it is set to off, each enclave
  application must import the ECalls/OCalls it needs into its own EDL file from
  `{OE_INSTALL_PATH}/include/openenclave/edl`.
* Experimental support for snmalloc. To use snmalloc, build the SDK from source using -DUSE\_SNMALLOC=ON.

### Changed

* Moved `oe_asymmetric_key_type_t`, `oe_asymmetric_key_format_t`, and
  `oe_asymmetric_key_params_t` to `bits/asym_keys.h` from `bits/types.h`.
* Windows host libraries in the Open Enclave NuGet package have been compiled with /WX /W3 enabled.
* Attestation plugin APIs in include/openenclave/attestation/plugin.h are marked experimental.

### Fixed

* Fix #2828 which removes an explicit host side dependency on libsgx-urts on Linux.
* Fix #2607 so that libmbedcrypto now includes mbedtls\_hkdf().
* Fix #2786 so that `CXX` is always `TRUE` in `add_enclave_sgx()` and `add_enclave_optee()`.
* Fix #2544 and #2264. This removes oesign's dependency on libsgx\_enclave\_common and libsgx\_dcap\_ql.
* Fix #2661 which caused inconsistent code generation in oeedger8r.

### Removed

* Removed oe-gdb script which has been deprecated since v0.6. Use oegdb instead.

### Security

* Update mbedTLS to version 2.16.6. Refer to the [2.16.5](https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/releases/mbedtls-2.16.5-and-2.7.14-released)
  and [2.16.6](https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/releases/mbedtls-2.16.6-and-2.7.15-released)
  release notes for the set of issues addressed.

### Deprecated

* oehostapp is being deprecated from cmake targets. Use oehost instead. See #2595.
* In the next release (v0.10), system EDL will no longer be compiled into OE
  libraries by default (COMPILE\_SYSTEM\_EDL will be OFF by default). See the
  [system EDL opt-in document]
  (docs/DesignDocs/system\_ocall\_opt\_in.md#how-to-port-your-application) for
  more details on how to rebuild the SDK to match this behavior and for
  guidance on porting your application to the new model.

## [v0.8.2](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2) - 2020-03-10

### Added

* OpenSSL engine support to oesign to allow signing keys via engines.
* NuGet package validation using CI/CD.
* Released packages include Load Value Injection(LVI) mitigated libraries, required build configuration and instructions.

### Changed

* Optimized switchless ocall scheduling.
* oedebugrt.pdb is part of the SDK package and needs to be copied to the host application folder along with oedebugrt.dll to enable debugging on Windows.

### Security

* OpenEnclave SDK includes LVI mitigated libs and an LVI mitigation build configuration for the vulnerability disclosed in CVE-2020-0551.
  + Applications built on top the SDK can optionally link against the mitigated libs using the LVI mitigation build configuration.
  + See [LVI Mititgation Documentation](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/Contributors/AdvancedBuildInfo.md#lvi-mitigation) for more information.

## [v0.8.1](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) - 2020-02-07

### Fixed

* Fixed Jenkins pipeline to produce a valid open-enclave NuGet package. Fixes #2523.

### Changed

* `oe_random()` now depends on the hardware-based source of RNG instead of cryptography libraries.
* OCall stack-stitching implemented as per Debugging Contract. OE SDK performs stack stitching
  instead of the debugger. Enclaves built using a prior release cannot be debugged with this version
  of oegdb and vice versa.

## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) - 2020-01-22

### Added

* Support for backtracing in debug and release builds.
  + Implementations for GNU functions `backtrace` and `backtrace_symbols` (defined in execinfo.h)
  + Enclaves are built using `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` for accurate backtraces.
* Support for custom attestation data formats via new plugin model. Please refer to the [design documentation](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DesignDocs/CustomAttestation.md).
* Support for host side sockets on Windows.
* Support to build OE enclave libraries with stack protector enabled.
  + Enable `-fstack-protector-strong` by default for enclave application build configurations in cmake and pkgconfig.

### Changed

* Open Enclave SDK is now officially an incubation project as part of the Linux
  Foundation's Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC).
  + All contributions are now accepted under the terms of the [Developer Certificate
    of Origin](https://developercertificate.org). For details, see
    [Contributing to Open Enclave](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/Contributing.md).
  + The copyright for all sources is now attributed to Open Enclave SDK contributors.
* Update Intel DCAP library dependencies to 1.4.1.
* Update Intel PSW dependencies to 2.6.100.2 on Windows.
* Enable `/W2 /WX` on Windows builds by default to treat W2 warnings as errors.
* Removed code related to deprecation of strftime.
* Enclave libs and enclaves are built using `-gc-sections`.
* Replace OCPWin and OCaml with esy. The CMake-driven OCaml build is replaced with esy and dune. To install esy as a prerequisite:
  - On Linux, `sudo ansible-playbook oe-linux-esy-setup.yml`
  - On Windows, `npm install -g esy@0.5.8`
* Update Ansible dependency from 2.8.0 to 2.8.2 in /scripts/ansible.
* safecrt.h and safemath.h are not installed as part of the SDK as they are meant for internal consumption.

### Fixed

* `oe_random()` now correctly returns a fully filled byte buffer for requests of > 1024 bytes.
* Add `openenclave` namespace to dl and crypto libraries to prevent symbol collisions. Fixes #2082.

### Deprecated

* `bits/safecrt.h` and `bits/safemath.h` are not published anymore. They were not intended
  for use by enclave authors. They are now moved to internal folder and not part of
  published headers.

### Security

* Update mbedTLS to version 2.16.4. Refer to [2.16.3](https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/releases/mbedtls-2.16.3-and-2.7.12-released) and
  [2.16.4](https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/releases/mbedtls-2.16.4-and-2.7.13-released)
  release notes for the set of issues addressed.

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) - 2019-10-26

### Added

* Support Intel DCAP attestation on Windows.
* Support `transition_using_threads` EDL attribute in oeedger8r.
  + This only applies to untrusted functions (ocalls) in this release.
  + Using this attribute allows the ocall to be invoked without incurring the
    performance cost of an enclave context switch.
* Ability to debug ELF enclaves on Windows using Windbg/CDB
  + [Visual Studio Code CDB Extension](https://aka.ms/CDBVSCode)
  + [WinDbg Preview](https://aka.ms/WinDbgPreview)
  + The new oedebugrt.dll and accompanying oedebugrt.pdb need to be copied to the
    app folder to enable this.
* Preview support for 64-bit ARM TrustZone-capable boards with OP-TEE OS
  + See the [documentation](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/OP-TEE/Introduction.md)
    for the list of supported platforms, features, and known issues.

### Changed

* Transferred repository from [microsoft/openenclave](https://github.com/microsoft/openenclave)
  to [openenclave/openenclave](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave).
* Change debugging contract for oegdb. Enclaves and hosts built prior to this
  release cannot be debugged with this version of oegdb and vice versa.
* Update Intel DCAP library dependencies to 1.3.
* Update Intel PSW dependencies to 2.7 on Linux and 2.5 on Windows.
* SGX1 configurations always take build dependency on Intel SGX enclave common library.
* Update LLVM libcxx to version 8.0.0.
* Update mbedTLS to version 2.16.2.

### Deprecated

* The mbedTLS libraries used in Open Enclave will no longer be compiled with the
  following config.h options in the next (v0.8) release:
  + `MBEDTLS_TLS_DEFAULT_ALLOW_SHA1_IN_KEY_EXCHANGE`: Considerable advances
    have been made in breaking SHA1 since our original review and we would
    like to be more prescriptive in recommending the use of SHA256.
  + `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_RSA_ENABLED`: This option provides no perfect
    forward secrecy and is generally becoming less popular as this is
    recognized. The ECDHE variants are also more performant.

### Security

* Fix enclave heap memory disclosure (CVE-2019-1369).

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0) - 2019-06-29

### Changed

* Rename `oe-gdb` to `oegdb` for consistency with other tools, such as `oesign`.
* Update pkg-config and CMake exports to include the following hardening build
  flags by default:
  + Enclaves will:
    - Compile with `-fPIE` instead of `-fPIC`.
    - Link with `-Wl,-z,noexecstack`, `-Wl,-z,now`.
  + Host apps will:
    - Compile with `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` (only effective if compiling under
      GCC with `-O2` specified) and `-fstack-protector-strong`.
    - Link with `-Wl,-z,noexecstack`.
    - Note that `-Wl,-z,now` is *not* enabled by default, but app authors
      should enable it themselves after assessing its startup impact.
* Removed support for the previously deprecated `OE_API_VERSION=1` APIs.
* Update MUSL libc to version 1.1.21.
* Update mbedTLS to version 2.7.11.

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) - 2019-04-09

### Added

* Open Enclave SDK works in Windows
  + Build using Visual Studio 2017's CMake Support
  + Build in x64 Native Prompt using Ninja
* Function table/id based ecall/ocall dispatching
  + oeedger8r generates ecall tables and ocall tables
  + Dispatching based on function-id (index into table)
  + oeedger8r generates `oe_create_foo_enclave` function for `foo.edl`
  + oe-gdb allows attaching to a host that is already running
* oe-gdb allows attaching to a host that is already running
* Added Quote Enclave Identity validation into `oe_verify_report` implementation
* Added OE SDK internal logging mechanism
* Support for thread local variables
  + Both GNU `__thread` and C++11 `thread_local`
  + Both hardware and simulation mode
  + Enclaves are compiled using local-exec thread-local model (-ftls-model=local-exec)
* Added `oe_get_public_key` and `oe_get_public_key_by_policy` host functions,
  which allow the host to get a public key derived from an enclave's identity.
* Added v2 versions of the following APIs that instead of passing in buffers now
  return a buffer that needs to be freed via an associated free method. `OE_API_VERSION`
  needs to be set to 2 to pick up the versions. The mentioned APIs have a \*\_V1 and \*\_V2
  version that the below versions map to detending on the `OE_API_VERSION`.
  + `oe_get_report`, free `report_buffer` via `oe_free_report`
  + `oe_get_target_info`, free `target_info_buffer` via `oe_free_target_info`
  + `oe_get_seal_key`, free `key_buffer` and `key_info` via `oe_free_seal_key`
  + `oe_get_seal_key_by_policy`, free `key_buffer` and `key_info` via `oe_free_seal_key`
* Added new enumeration for enclave type parameter of `oe_create_enclave`. Now use
  `OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_AUTO` to have the enclave appropriate to your built environment
  be chosen automatically. For instance, building Intel binaries will select SGX
  automatically, where on ARM it will pick TrustZone.
* Added three new APIs for attestation certificate generation and verification

### Changed

* `oe_create_enclave` takes two additional parameters: `ocall_table` and
  `ocall_table_size`.
* Update mbedTLS library to version 2.7.9.
* Update MUSL libc to version 1.1.20.
* Update LLVM libcxx to version 7.0.0.
  + Some libcxx headers (e.g. `<string>`) now use C++11 template features and
    may require compiling with the `-std=c++11` option when building with GCC.
* Update minimum required CMake version for building from source to 3.13.1.
* Update minimum required C++ standard for building from source to C++14.
* Moved `oe_seal_policy_t`, `oe_asymmetric_key_type_t`, `oe_asymmetric_key_format_t`,
  and `oe_asymmetric_key_params_t` to `bits/types.h` from `enclave.h`.
* Changed minimum required QE ISVSVN version from 1 to 2 for the QE Identity
  revocation check that is performed during quote verification. Remote reports
  that were generated with a QE ISVSVN version of 1 will fail during report
  verification now. To resolve this issue, please install the latest version
  of the [Intel SGX DCAP packages](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads)
  (1.0.1 or newer) on the system that generates the remote report.
* Revamped `oesign` CLI tool arguments parsing. Instead of relying on the arguments
  order and name, named parameters are used as such:
  + The `sign` subcommand accepts the following mandatory flags:
    - `--enclave-image [-e]`, the enclave image file path
    - `--config-file [-c]`, the path of the config file with enclave properties
    - `--key-file [-k]`, the path of the private key file used to digitally sign the enclave image
  + The `dump` subcommand accepts only the `--enclave-image [-e]` mandatory flag, for the enclave file path.

### Deprecated

* String based `ocalls`/`ecalls`, `OE_ECALL`, and `OE_OCALL` macros.
* `OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_UNDEFINED` was removed and replaced with `OE_ENCLAVE_TYPE_AUTO`.

### Fixed

* Check support for AVX in platform/OS before setting SECS.ATTRIBUTES.XFRM in enclave.

### Security

* Fix CVE-2019-0876
  + `_handle_sgx_get_report` will now write to the supplied argument if it lies in host memory.
  + Added check for missing null terminator in oeedger8r generated code.

## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) - 2018-12-21 (DEPRECATED)

v0.4.1 contains a small fix to work with Intel's new ISV version bump.

### Changed

* This allows the OE SDK to continue to support reports signed by QE SVN=1,
  and at the same time also allow a newer QE SVN (greater than 1) during the
  oe\_verify\_report process.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/compare/v0.1.0...v0.4.0) - 2018-10-08 (DEPRECATED)

v0.4.0 is the first public preview release, with numerous breaking changes from v0.1.0
as listed below.

* Expand documentation for running on different configurations.
* Add pkg-config files for building Open Enclave apps in C/C++ for GCC or Clang.
* Add data sealing sample.
* Add `oe_call_host_by_address()` to allow enclaves to make OCALLs by callback pointer.
* Add `oe_get_enclave()` to obtain enclave handle to return to host.
* Add `oe_get_target_info()` to support SGX local attestation.
* Add CMake export configuration to SDK (experimental).

### Changed

* Standardize naming convention on new [Development Guide](/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/DevelopmentGuide.md).
* Standardize Open Enclave APIs to use `size_t` type for buffer sizes.
* Standardize Open Enclave APIs to always clear output parameters on error return.
* Change report type detection logic.
  + Reports generated by Open Enclave are no longer transparently usable by Intel SGX SDK.
* Change `oe_identity.authorID` field to `oe_identity.signerID`.
* Clean up thread local storage on return from ECALL.
* Refactor liboecore and liboeenclave dependency.
  + All enclave apps must now link liboeenclave.
* Refactor liboecore and liboelibc dependency.
  + All enclave apps should call libc for C functions instead.
* Break up remote attestation sample into 4 separate samples.
* Simplify `oe_get_report()` so it doesn't accept unused `reportdata` on host side.
* Reduce the set of `oe_result` values returned.
* Update mbedTLS library to version 2.7.5.
* Update LLVM libcxx to version 6.0.1.
* Update MUSL libc to version 1.1.19.

# Socket syscalls can leak enclave memory contents

Moderate

[radhikaj](/radhikaj)
published
GHSA-525h-wxcc-f66m
Oct 12, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 0.12.0

## Patched versions

0.12.0

## Description

### Impact

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when an enclave application using the syscalls provided by the sockets.edl is loaded by a malicious host application. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could read privileged data from the enclave heap across trust boundaries.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information otherwise considered confidential in an enclave, which could be used in further compromises.

### Patches

The issue has been addressed in version 0.12.0 and the current master branch. Users will need to to recompile their applications against the patched libraries to be protected from this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Aside from not linking in the socket.edl syscall implementation, no workarounds have been identified.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account.

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v0.10.0...v0.11.0`
