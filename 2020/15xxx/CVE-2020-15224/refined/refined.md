{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how socket syscalls within the Open Enclave SDK handle memory buffers when interacting with a malicious host application. Specifically, when an enclave uses socket syscalls for operations like sendto or recvfrom, the host can manipulate the provided address buffer to cause an out-of-bounds read/write, thus potentially leaking enclave memory contents.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Out-of-bounds Read/Write",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious host application can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive data from the enclave's heap memory, potentially leading to further compromises.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious host application interacting with an enclave utilizing the vulnerable socket syscalls provided by `socket.edl`.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious host application that interacts with an enclave using the vulnerable socket syscall implementations.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in versions of the Open Enclave SDK prior to v0.12.0 and the fix involves additional input sanitization and bounds checking of input buffers before interacting with the host, preventing the host from writing out-of-bounds in the enclaveâ€™s memory region. The fix also involves changing the `oe_sockaddr` from being passed as in-out parameter to just an out parameter.\n"
