Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `acsd` service on Netgear R6700 routers does not validate the size of incoming data, leading to a buffer overflow when a large amount of data is sent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected router with admin privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network adjacency:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router.
- **TCP Port 5916:** The `acsd` service, which is vulnerable, listens on TCP port 5916 by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected Netgear R6700v3 router and does not require authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to port 5916.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is identified by CVE-2020-15635 and ZDI-CAN-9853.
- The vulnerability exists in firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.98 for the NETGEAR R6700v3 router.
- The vulnerability is in the `acsd` service.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 8.8, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which confirms the high severity of the flaw.
- The vulnerability was reported by Pedro Ribeiro (@pedrib1337) and Radek Domanski (@RabbitPro), working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
- NETGEAR has released a fix in firmware version 1.0.4.98.
