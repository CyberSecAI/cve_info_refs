{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The document mentions a fix for a 'Critical Information Disclosure In HTTP Responses vulnerability', a 'Serv-U not validating argument path' vulnerability, a 'CHMOD FTP command vulnerability', and a 'Remote command execution vulnerability'. However, it does not provide specific root causes for these vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Critical Information Disclosure In HTTP Responses",
    "Serv-U not validating argument path",
    "CHMOD FTP command vulnerability",
    "Remote command execution vulnerability",
	"Cross-site scripting vulnerability",
    "JQuery pre-3.4.0 vulnerability (CVE-2019-11358)",
	"MD5 password storage"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The document implies these vulnerabilities could lead to information disclosure, potentially allow remote command execution and cross-site scripting attacks. The MD5 password storage is a vulnerability that could be exploited with rainbow table attacks to discover plain text passwords, and a potential attack vector is the now depreciated 3DES algorithm.",
  "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vectors are not detailed, but they involve HTTP responses, argument paths within Serv-U, FTP CHMOD commands, and remote command execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the Serv-U service via HTTP requests or FTP commands, or be able to carry out a cross site scripting attack. The attacker would also need to be able to intercept traffic to try and exploit the depreciated 3DES algorithm."
