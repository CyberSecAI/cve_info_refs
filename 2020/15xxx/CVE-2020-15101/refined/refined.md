Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `os.walk()` in the freewvs tool without proper safeguards against excessively deep directory structures. Python's recursion limit can be reached when `os.walk()` traverses a directory tree with more than 1000 nested directories, causing the scan to fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unbounded recursion: The `os.walk()` function was used without any mechanism to limit the depth of recursion, making it susceptible to stack overflow errors when encountering deeply nested directories.
- Lack of input validation: The tool doesn't validate the depth of the directory structures it scans, relying solely on `os.walk` which can crash on excessively deep paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can create a directory structure with more than 1000 nested levels, causing freewvs to crash due to a recursion error. This prevents the tool from completing its intended scan of the target system/directory.
- Interruption of scans: Administrators using freewvs can have scans interrupted if a target directory contains many nested directories and this could potentially be used to disrupt security auditing efforts, and potentially be used to hide malicious files/directories within large, nested folders.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Directory Structure: An attacker can craft a directory structure with more than 1000 nested levels, then use this as a target for a freewvs scan.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create/control directory structure: An attacker needs the ability to create or control the directory structure that freewvs will scan.
- The attacker doesn't require any specific privileges on the system to be scanned, as the vulnerability resides in how freewvs handles the directory traversal itself.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented in commit `83a6b55c0435c69f447488b791555e6078803143` limits the recursion depth to 500 directories, addressing the issue. This was achieved by adding a check within the `os.walk()` loop that prevents the function from recursing deeper than 500 nested directories.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered "low"
