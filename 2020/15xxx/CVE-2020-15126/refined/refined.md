Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-15126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the GraphQL viewer query in parse-server. An authenticated user could bypass read security checks on their User object and all related objects linked via relations or pointers. This indicates a flaw in how the GraphQL query handles authorization and data access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is that the GraphQL viewer query does not correctly enforce read permissions. It allows access to user data and related data regardless of defined access control lists (ACLs).
*   **Data Exposure:** This vulnerability allows a user to potentially access sensitive information beyond what they are authorized to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker (authenticated user) can read data they are not intended to access, potentially including personal or sensitive information of other users, or data related to them.
*   **Bypass of Access Control:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended data access restrictions.
*   **Information Disclosure**: The attacker can potentially gain more information about system structure or data schemas through unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered using the GraphQL viewer query.
*   The attack vector is over the network by crafting specific GraphQL requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the parse-server application.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to use the GraphQL API.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects parse-server versions 3.5.0 and later, prior to the fix in version 4.3.0.
*   The fix is linked to [commit 78239ac](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/78239ac9071167fdf243c55ae4bc9a2c0b0d89aa).
*   The vulnerability is considered "High" severity.
*   The commit fixes the breach by updating `usersMutations.js` and `usersQueries.js`, likely adding the correct authorization checks for data access.
