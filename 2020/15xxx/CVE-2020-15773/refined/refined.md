Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15773:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The build scan Export API in Gradle Enterprise allows cross-origin browser requests, meaning a request from a different domain than the one hosting the API is allowed. This is often restricted by browsers for security reasons.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CORS Misconfiguration:** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration. The API does not restrict which domains are allowed to make requests, which is generally required to prevent CSRF-like attacks on APIs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by executing malicious code in a victim's browser. If the victim has an active session with Gradle Enterprise, the attacker's code can use the Export API to access build scan data on behalf of that user. This results in unauthorized access to information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) or Similar Browser-Based Code Execution:** The attack requires the attacker to be able to execute code in the browser of a user who is logged into Gradle Enterprise. This can be achieved via an XSS vulnerability in a site the user visits, or if the user is tricked into opening a malicious web page. 
- **Browser-based CSRF:**  With the ability to perform cross-origin requests, an attacker can craft a malicious request from the user's browser, effectively acting on behalf of the logged in user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to execute code in the victim's browser:** This is the primary requirement. The attacker must be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser while they are logged into Gradle Enterprise.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to be aware of the Export API endpoint and how to use it to extract data.
- **Target with active Gradle Enterprise session:**  The victim needs to be authenticated with Gradle Enterprise for the attack to succeed.
