Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15678:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from multiple sources, including Mozilla's security advisories, SUSE's CVE pages, Debian security advisories and Gentoo's GLSA, confirms that CVE-2020-15678 is related to a vulnerability present in Mozilla Firefox, Firefox ESR and Thunderbird. The descriptions provided align with the official CVE description which mentions an issue related to recursing through graphical layers while scrolling. 

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of iterators during recursive calls within the `APZCTreeManager::ComputeClippedCompositionBounds` function. Specifically, the code did not respect iterator invalidation rules, where inserting into a `std::unordered_map` may invalidate existing iterators.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition resulting from iterator invalidation. The iterator, potentially invalidated by a rehash within an unordered map, is used to access memory after it has been freed, which could lead to memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could potentially result in a use-after-free scenario. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, a crash, or other unpredictable behavior. 
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability exists in the code path that recurses through layers while scrolling in the browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** 
    *   An attacker needs to trigger the code path that recurses through layers during scrolling by manipulating parameters that will trigger a rehash within the unordered map used by the APZCTreeManager.
    *   The attacker would need to induce a scenario where there is enough recursion in order to increase the likelihood of the iterator invalidation being exploited.
    *   The exploit happens in the parent or GPU process, limiting the capabilities for a direct attack, requiring more specific control of memory or execution flow to exploit.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   Some sources classify this vulnerability as having "moderate" severity, with exploitation being difficult because the iterator invalidation happens in the parent or GPU process, making it harder to control through JavaScript.
*   The fix involves ensuring that iterators are not used after an insertion to avoid the use-after-free condition, by respecting iterator invalidation rules in `ComputeClippedCompositionBounds()` function.
*   The vulnerability is present in:
    *   Firefox versions prior to 81.
    *   Firefox ESR versions prior to 78.3.
    *   Thunderbird versions prior to 78.3.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by the change made by bug 1617179.

**Summary of findings:**
The core issue is with how Mozilla's code handles iterators when recursively processing graphical layers, where an iterator might become invalid leading to use-after-free. This vulnerability exists in the APZCTreeManager class in the functions related to scrolling, which is triggered by the use of a `std::unordered_map`, which is vulnerable to rehash on inserts leading to iterator invalidation. The fix is present in later versions of Firefox, Firefox ESR and Thunderbird. The vulnerability is rated as having moderate security implications.
