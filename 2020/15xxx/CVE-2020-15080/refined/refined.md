Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of sensitive files (specifically `composer.json` and `docker-compose.yml`) within the release archive of PrestaShop. These files, if exposed, can reveal information about the application's dependencies, configurations, and environment.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the unintentional exposure of sensitive configuration and dependency information via the inclusion of `composer.json` and `docker-compose.yml` in the release archive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The disclosure of `composer.json` reveals the application's dependencies and their versions, potentially aiding attackers in identifying known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
- The `docker-compose.yml` file can reveal the application's infrastructure setup, including database credentials, service configurations, and environment variables. This information could be used to launch further attacks or gain unauthorized access to the underlying infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the release archive, typically downloaded from the PrestaShop website.  The exposed files are in the release archive, making it available for download.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the release archive, typically downloaded from the PrestaShop website or obtained through other means where the archive was distributed.
- No specific user privileges within the application are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix for this issue was to exclude `docker-compose.yml` from the release archive and to add a `.htaccess` rule that protects the `composer.lock` file from being directly accessed.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.6.6 of PrestaShop.
- The provided content references the following commit which addresses this vulnerability: `35ef7e9d892287c302df1fc5aa05ecfc6f15bc76`
