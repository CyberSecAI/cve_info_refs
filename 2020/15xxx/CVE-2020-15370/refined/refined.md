- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information (user passwords) in log files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated, remote attacker can view user passwords in cleartext by accessing the log files.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access by an authenticated attacker who can view the log files.
