Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2020:1822-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1157594 #1177967
Cross-References: CVE-2020-15917

An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for claws-mail fixes the following issues:
- Additional cleanup of the template handling
claws-mail was updated to 3.17.8 (boo#1177967)
\* Shielded template's |program{} and |attach\_program{} so that the
command-line that is executed does not allow sequencing such as with
&& || ;, preventing possible execution of nasty, or at least
unexpected, commands
\* bug fixes: claws#4376
\* updated English, French, and Spanish manuals
- Update to 3.17.7
\* Image Viewer: Image attachments, when displayed, are now resized to
fit the available width rather than the available height.
\* -d is now an alias to --debug.
\* Libravatar plugin: New styles supported: Robohash and Pagan.
\* SpamAssassin plugin: The 'Maximum size' option now matches
SpamAssassin's maximum; it can now handle messages up to 256MB.
\* LiteHTML viewer plugin: The UI is now translatable. Bug fixes:
\* bug 4313, 'Recursion stack overflow with rebuilding folder tree'
\* bug 4372, '[pl\_PL] Crash after "Send later" without recipient and then
"Close"'
\* bug 4373, 'attach mailto URI double free'
\* bug 4374, 'insert mailto URI misses checks'
\* bug 4384, 'U+00AD (soft hyphen) changed to space in Subject'
\* bug 4386, 'Allow Sieve config without userid without warning'
\* Add missing SSL settings when cloning accounts.
\* Parsing of command-line arguments.
\* PGP Core plugin: fix segv in address completion with a keyring.
\* Libravatar plugin: fixes to image display.
- Disable python-gtk plugin on suse\_version > 1500: still relying
on python2, which is EOL.
- Update to 3.17.6:
\* It is now possible to 'Inherit Folder properties and processing rules
from parent folder' when creating new folders with the move message
and copy message dialogues.
\* A Phishing warning is now shown when copying a phishing URL, (in
addition to clicking a phishing URL).
\* The progress window when importing an mbox file is now more responsive.
\* A warning dialogue is shown if the selected privacy system is 'None'
and automatic signing amd/or encrypting is enabled.
\* Python plugin: pkgconfig is now used to check for python2. This
enables the Python plugin (which uses python2) to be built on newer
systems which have both python2 and python3. Bug fixes:
\* bug 3922, 'minimize to tray on startup not working'
\* bug 4220, 'generates files in cache without content'
\* bug 4325, 'Following redirects when retrieving image'
\* bug 4342, 'Import mbox file command doesn't work twice on a row'
\* fix STARTTLS protocol violation

\* fix fat-fingered crash when v (hiding msgview) is pressed just before
c (check signature)
\* fix non-translation of some Templates strings

| [Description](#c0)  Stefan Schweizer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-12-04 12:11:36 UTC  ``` Hi, after one of the recent gcc-config updates gcc-3.4.3 stopped working for me, so I emerged gcc-3.3.5 with gcc-3.3.4-rlatest. That worked for a while, but now it fails to compile the new gcc-3.4.3.

The problem is that server:mail/libetpan, although it has the same SONAME, is probably not backward compatible with the version from openSUSE:Leap:15.1.  So, claws-mail builds with server:mail/libetpan (1.9.3) and then you try to run it with libetpan (1.9.1), which causes your problem.  If you check the RPM, it has a Requires: libetpan.so.20()(64bit) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c5)  Jean Delvare   2019-11-25 10:06:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Vetter from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c3)) > On my system (Tumbleweed) libetpan20 is installed.

The problem is that server:mail/libetpan, although it > has the same SONAME, is probably not backward compatible with the version > from openSUSE:Leap:15.1.  It is backward compatible. I can install server:mail/libetpan on my Leap 15.1 and the old claws-mail will run just fine. However, it is not forward compatible.  > So, claws-mail builds with server:mail/libetpan (1.9.3) and then you try to > run it with libetpan (1.9.1), which causes your problem.  libetpan 1.9.2 introduced a new API function mailstream_ssl_set_server_name(), which claws-mail will use if it was available at build time. Building against libetpan-devel version 1.9.3 causes the function to be used, but when running with libetpan version 1.9.1 the function is missing and the crash happens.  > If you check the RPM, it has a Requires: libetpan.so.20()(64bit)  Adam, thanks for jumping in, but how does it help to close a bug as invalid when the problem is real and needs to be solved somehow? I assigned the bug to myself, which means I'm taking care of it.   As far as I know it is not uncommon to keep the SONAME when only adding new, optional functions to the API. The library versions are not fundamentally incompatible, in the sense that an application built against libetpan-devel version 1.9.1 would run just fine with libetpan version 1.9.3. Changing the SONAME would force all the applications using that library to be rebuilt for the new version, short of maintaining and installing both versions in parallel on every system.  So I would not put the blame on libetpan. Instead I believe we need to add a more specific dependency in claws-mail. What we need is: if libetpan-devel version at build time was >= 1.9.2 then the claws-mail package should depend on libetpan >= 1.9.2. I'm just not sure how to express that in rpm spec language. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c8)  Jean Delvare   2019-11-25 11:03:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Vetter from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c6)) > It is relevant because you added server:mail as a repo to Leap 15.1, and > don't use the packages from the official Leap repo. Not sorry.  OK, it's not a bug in Leap 15.1, it's a bug in server:mail. Isn't the whole point of building packages for multiple distributions in devel projects to allow more people to test and use them?  Can you please suggest what Classification and Product I should use in bugzilla to report such a bug? I chose what I thought was the closest and most appropriate but apparently you disagree? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c9)  Michael Vetter   2019-11-25 11:16:17 UTC  ``` > So I would not put the blame on libetpan.

What we need is: if libetpan-devel version at build time was >= 1.9.2 then the claws-mail package should depend on libetpan >= 1.9.2. I'm just not sure how to express that in rpm spec language.

I'm just not sure how to express that in rpm spec > language.  And here's the problem. In RPM world, AFAIK, there is no way for library to specify these dependencies. In Debian, we would have dpkg-shlibdeps, but in RPM, the dependency is only on library soname from rpmbuild. This is why mixing these things is not really supported and can break your system.  This is also the reason why we have OBS. OBS "always" rebuilds your dependencies so ABI issues like this will not popup. It's a different approach from Debian in dealing with these problems. But then we don't need to keep track of symbol names or ABI breakages (at least prior to release). We throw computers at the problem instead. And these problems only popup when you mix things like you've done.   PS. I've reassigned this bug to component that is for devel projects. But it remains invalid because the needed Requires: is not really possible. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c11)  Jean Delvare   2019-11-25 13:43:47 UTC  ``` Actually adding the following to the spec file seems to fix the problem nicely (big thanks to Coolo and Fabian Vogt for the help on IRC):  # libetpan 1.9.2 introduced function mailstream_ssl_set_server_name, which # will be used by claws-mail if available %if %{pkg_vcmp libetpan-devel >= 1.9.2} Requires:       libetpan >= 1.9.2 %endif  So I'm just going to add that to server:mail/claws-mail. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c12)  Adam Majer   2019-11-25 13:53:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jean Delvare from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c11)) > Actually adding the following to the spec file seems to fix the problem > nicely (big thanks to Coolo and Fabian Vogt for the help on IRC): >  > # libetpan 1.9.2 introduced function mailstream_ssl_set_server_name, which > # will be used by claws-mail if available > %if %{pkg_vcmp libetpan-devel >= 1.9.2} > Requires:       libetpan >= 1.9.2 > %endif >  > So I'm just going to add that to server:mail/claws-mail.  Yes, but this is broken way of doing things. This dependency should come *from* libetpan, not from the claws-mail spec file. And if we are to be adding this stuff, we should be adding this stuff to rpmbuild via symbol files, not like this. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c13)  Jean Delvare   2019-11-25 15:27:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adam Majer from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c12)) > Yes, but this is broken way of doing things. This dependency should come > *from* libetpan, not from the claws-mail spec file.  You mean that libetpan would have "I implement library symbol mailstream_ssl_set_server_name and claws-mail would have "I need symbol mailstream_ssl_set_server_name from libetpan"?  Do we already have a standard rpm dependency syntax to express this?  This certainly looks cleaner on the paper, but I fail to see the gain in practice. Unless we automatize the "I implement" part, this means modifying 2 spec files instead of only 1. And we still need a conditional in claws-mail.spec, as the need for the symbol actually depends on the build environment. So what's the benefit exactly?  Automatizing this would add a huge number of dependencies, most of which aren't needed, which would increase build times, package sizes and resolution times. Symbols which need to be tested like this are the exception, not the rule. So I very much doubt we cant to go that route either.  > And if we are to be > adding this stuff, we should be adding this stuff to rpmbuild via symbol > files, not like this.  I have no idea what you mean here, sorry. Adding what to rpmbuild? What are "symbol files" in this context? ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c14)  Jean Delvare   2019-11-25 15:44:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Vetter from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c9)) > BuildRequires:  libetpan-devel >= 1.9.2  That doesn't help. We are already building the package with libetpan-devel >= 1.9.2 and in fact that's exactly why the problem happens (see [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c7)). Furthermore this is not even correct, claws-mail 3.17.4 does not depend on libetpan-devel >= 1.9.2. It will have an extra feature if libetpan-devel >= 1.9.2, but building with older versions is still possible. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c15)  Adam Majer   2019-11-25 15:53:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jean Delvare from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c13)) > Automatizing this would add a huge number of dependencies, most of which > aren't needed, which would increase build times, package sizes and > resolution times. Symbols which need to be tested like this are the > exception, not the rule. So I very much doubt we cant to go that route > either.  No, this is the rule. It actually is tested *every time* you load the binary - the linker does that. It's not magic.  But we don't do this because our policy is to rebuild the binary instead of relying on ABI compatibility. This is why you can upload completely incompatible libraries with same SONAME to Tumbleweed and it's not a bug for openSUSE, but it's completely wrong for Debian. On Debian, the opposite is true.  Often, upstream does not keep track ABI compatibility correctly anyway, that's why we just rebuild.  You are wrong in this being an expensive calculation. It's not. But it requires we keep additional data around. See Debian for example (explained below)  > > And if we are to be > > adding this stuff, we should be adding this stuff to rpmbuild via symbol > > files, not like this. >  > I have no idea what you mean here, sorry. Adding what to rpmbuild? What are > "symbol files" in this context?  Look at the dependencies here. You see correct version of libetpan20,  <https://packages.debian.org/buster/claws-mail>  If you look in the debian/control file (spec file for Debian),  <https://sources.debian.org/src/claws-mail/3.17.4-2/debian/control/>  you see only a build dependency on libetpan-dev (>= 1.5). The correct version dependency comes from the library dependency generated by debian build system. You can actually find the symbols exported by this library in the library,  <https://sources.debian.org/src/libetpan/1.9.3-2/debian/libetpan20.symbols/>  ... mailstream_ssl_set_server_name@Base 1.9.2 ...  The debian build system then matches ALL the symbols that are *used* by the binary and then assigns the minimum version number that includes all these symbols. So another user of libetpan20 may get different version number on the dependency.  If we wish to be able to do the same, we have to have the same system where we track what symbols a library and it appeared at what version of the library.  Right now we don't have anything like this. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c16)  Adam Majer   2019-11-29 12:11:23 UTC  ``` Also, it's possible for libetpan to version its symbols and then that dependency would be added to claws-mail automatically.  <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352014/breaking-down-rpms-identifiers-for-shared-library-files>  But since almost no library does that (and we've had long discussion even to get OpenSSL to export versioned symbols to prevent conflicts between libraries), we have what we have -- crashes. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c17)  Jean Delvare   2019-12-04 09:27:10 UTC  ``` Let's continue this discussion off bugzilla. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c18)  Jean Delvare   2019-12-17 10:01:06 UTC  ``` Fix went in server:mail 3 days ago, closing. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c19)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-10-22 14:10:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157594) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/843433> 15.1+15.2+Backports:SLE-15-SP1+Backports:SLE-15-SP2 / claws-mail ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c20)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-10-26 13:30:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157594) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/844084> 15.1+15.2+Backports:SLE-15-SP1+Backports:SLE-15-SP2 / claws-mail ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1157594#c21)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-11-03 05:14:34 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:1822-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata is now available.
