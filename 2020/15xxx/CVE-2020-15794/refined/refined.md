- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application discloses absolute paths to requested resources in some error messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Full path disclosure. The application exposes sensitive information by including the full path of the requested resource in error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can retrieve additional information about the host system, potentially aiding further attacks by understanding the file structure and location.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the web application's error messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web application to trigger the error messages and access the full path disclosure.
