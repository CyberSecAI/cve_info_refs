* Firefox ESR 78.4

#### [#CVE-2020-15969: Use-after-free in usersctp](#CVE-2020-15969)

Reporter
Mark Wodrich of Google
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free bug in the usersctp library was reported upstream. We assume this could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-15683: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4](#CVE-2020-15683)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Jason Kratzer, Simon Giesecke, Philipp, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

This is basically <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1005596> .

(In reply to Daniel Veditz [:dveditz] from [bug 1635474 comment #6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1635474#c6 "NEW"))

> Similar, but in this case there are two tabs involved and the background one can legitimately run script at any time. We could in theory focus the tab that triggered the dialog (rude?), or suppress the dialog/navigation if it's coming from a window that isn't active (like a popup blocker?), or try to state the origin of the initiating window on the prompt. That last is pretty weak and we've seen people not really notice the "wrong origin" case on the HTTP Auth dialog.

We just need to switch to permissions for this, and get rid of this ancient dialog. I started work on [bug 1196151](/show_bug.cgi?id=1196151 "RESOLVED FIXED - Custom protocol handler (registerProtocolHandler) can't be opened in iframe") before this was reported, which cleans things up a bit (the implementation is a bit messy atm), and then I hope to be able to switch away from the dialog in e.g. [bug 1565574](/show_bug.cgi?id=1565574 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Always allow' for external protocol / scheme handling should be a per-origin permission").

It appears Chrome has just changed whatever dialog they show to include the origin requesting the link. I think the remaining question for us is what we want to do in the cases where we don't show a dialog at all - mailto: on desktop (which I think is fine, as no email client will actually *send* an email), but I'm unclear on which other things exist on Fenix, and what we do there.

I think [bug 1635474](/show_bug.cgi?id=1635474 "NEW") is effectively the same but for iOS, so I'm moving discussion here given that this is desktop-focused. Dan, thoughts?

How do permissions help? Because the victim would presumably not have given `tel:` permission to the attacker, and then would have to switch back to that tab to interact with the doorhanger? Once the user grants permission (if it's remembered) then that particular scheme-origin pair would move into the no-dialog case like `mailto:`. That's probably fine? Users can do that today, and if they choose badly then every site can abuse the scheme. With a permission model only the site the user trusted could abuse it.

How far out is that work? Is it worth doing a short-term band-aide of stuffing the true origin in that dialog in the meanwhile? It's really not that effective a fix though, as we've noted somewhere in one if these bugs. It's a CYA move for us, but probably not much help in an actual spoofing attack.

> How do permissions help? Because the victim would presumably not have given `tel:` permission to the attacker, and then would have to switch back to that tab to interact with the doorhanger?

Yes, the doorhanger would not show unless the tab was selected, I assume.

> Once the user grants permission (if it's remembered) then that particular scheme-origin pair would move into the no-dialog case like `mailto:`. That's probably fine? Users can do that today, and if they choose badly then every site can abuse the scheme. With a permission model only the site the user trusted could abuse it.

Yep.

> How far out is that work?

I'm not sure. I started some groundwork but I won't know how easy it is to switch to permissions until I actually try to do it.

> Is it worth doing a short-term band-aide of stuffing the true origin in that dialog in the meanwhile? It's really not that effective a fix though, as we've noted somewhere in one if these bugs. It's a CYA move for us, but probably not much help in an actual spoofing attack.

I don't think it's worth it. If anything I'd sooner check if the originating browsingcontext is in an active docshell and just ignore the navigation if it isn't... That fixes this bug but not all the other things that would be fixed by switching to permissions.

Unfortunately this bug does not qualify for our bounty program due to its low severity. Is this example PoC hosted on a web site somewhere? We've gotten bugs about abusing `tel:` on apple.com support for years.

Hi Gijh,

Can you explain a bit how the fix from [Bug 1661030](/show_bug.cgi?id=1661030 "RESOLVED FIXED - Show external protocol dialog in TabDialogBox") should work in this case?

Right now on the latest Nightly the 40s button will open about:blank with the dialog and the 4000 s button will open a new window with <https://www.apple.com/contact/> loaded but without the dialog.

I supposed it is correct for the dialog to not appear, reading through the comments, but just want to make sure.

The correct thing is for either the dialog to appear but not in front of apple.com, or for apple.com to load and us to not show the dialog, yes.

Thank you. Marking this as verified-fixed for the latest Firefox Nightly 83.0a1 (2020-09-23) (64-bit) and Beta 82.0b2 (64-bit) on Windows 10, MacOS 10.15 and Ubuntu 20.04.

Clicking on the 40s button will open a new window with about:blank and the dialog.

Clicking on the 4000s button will load the apple.com page in a new window without any dialog (sometimes on Beta it loads about:blank with dialog)

Either way, the dialog is not displayed in front if we have apple.com loaded.

#### [#CVE-2020-15969: Use-after-free in usersctp](#CVE-2020-15969)

Reporter
Mark Wodrich of Google
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free bug in the usersctp library was reported upstream. We assume this could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-15254: Undefined behavior in bounded channel of crossbeam rust crate](#CVE-2020-15254)

Reporter
Caelum van Ispelen
Impact
high
##### Description

In the crossbeam rust crate, the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from\_iter had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from\_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from\_iter had allocated different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined, but in another use case, the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.

#### [#CVE-2020-15680: Presence of external protocol handlers could be determined through image tags](#CVE-2020-15680)

Reporter
Rotem Kerner
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a valid external protocol handler was referenced in an image tag, the resulting broken image size could be distinguished from a broken image size of a non-existent protocol handler. This allowed an attacker to successfully probe whether an external protocol handler was registered.

#### [#CVE-2020-15681: Multiple WASM threads may have overwritten each others' stub table entries](#CVE-2020-15681)

Reporter
Alon Zakai
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When multiple WASM threads had a reference to a module, and were looking up exported functions, one WASM thread could have overwritten another's entry in a shared stub table, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-15682: The domain associated with the prompt to open an external protocol could be spoofed to display the incorrect origin](#CVE-2020-15682)

Reporter
Lijo A.T.
Impact
low
##### Description

When a link to an external protocol was clicked, a prompt was presented that allowed the user to choose what application to open it in. An attacker could induce that prompt to be associated with an origin they didn't control, resulting in a spoofing attack. This was fixed by changing external protocol prompts to be tab-modal while also ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different origin.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Simon Giesecke, Christian Holler, Philipp, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Package        : thunderbird
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-15683 CVE-2020-15969

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:78.4.0-1~deb10u1.

# CVE-2020-15683

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-15682.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-15684.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-15683 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15683)

#### Description

Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.4, Firefox < 82, and Thunderbird < 78.4.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: This patch has already been made public upstream, so hopefully not easily.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Same patch should apply with minimal modifications to all affected versions. The \_\_FBSDID string change sometimes requires a manual merge.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Unlikely to cause regressions, this patch is already present in Chromium.

Chrome is taking this fix, too. [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/4eef337a54cd51af5d2d12a1dd32f5581ef265d4](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/%2B/4eef337a54cd51af5d2d12a1dd32f5581ef265d4)

> **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?:** No

Sort of... "cherrypick" can raise eyebrows and the referenced upstream patch clearly says "use after free". Not sure we can do much better since anyone watching that closely probably already saw the upstream and would be happy to not see it in our commits.

#### [#CVE-2020-15969: Use-after-free in usersctp](#CVE-2020-15969)

Reporter
Mark Wodrich of Google
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free bug in the usersctp library was reported upstream. We assume this could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

#### [#CVE-2020-15254: Undefined behavior in bounded channel of crossbeam rust crate](#CVE-2020-15254)

Reporter
Caelum van Ispelen
Impact
high
##### Description

In the crossbeam rust crate, the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from\_iter had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from\_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from\_iter had allocated different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined, but in another use case, the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.

#### [#CVE-2020-15680: Presence of external protocol handlers could be determined through image tags](#CVE-2020-15680)

Reporter
Rotem Kerner
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a valid external protocol handler was referenced in an image tag, the resulting broken image size could be distinguished from a broken image size of a non-existent protocol handler. This allowed an attacker to successfully probe whether an external protocol handler was registered.

#### [#CVE-2020-15681: Multiple WASM threads may have overwritten each others' stub table entries](#CVE-2020-15681)

Reporter
Alon Zakai
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When multiple WASM threads had a reference to a module, and were looking up exported functions, one WASM thread could have overwritten another's entry in a shared stub table, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1666568](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666568)

#### [#CVE-2020-15682: The domain associated with the prompt to open an external protocol could be spoofed to display the incorrect origin](#CVE-2020-15682)

Reporter
Lijo A.T.
Impact
low
##### Description

When a link to an external protocol was clicked, a prompt was presented that allowed the user to choose what application to open it in. An attacker could induce that prompt to be associated with an origin they didn't control, resulting in a spoofing attack. This was fixed by changing external protocol prompts to be tab-modal while also ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different origin.

#### [#CVE-2020-15683: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4](#CVE-2020-15683)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Simon Giesecke, Christian Holler, Philipp, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

I get menu bars and the calendar area, but no accounts, no emails and no folders. Those areas are just white blanks.  Trying to open in Safe mode, gives no results.  Launching the software from command line, gives no output messages.  No extensions or themes installed.  Preferences menu doesn't open at all.  Downloading Thunderbird 78.2.1 from <https://give.thunderbird.net/> solved the issue (so the profile, I think, is not the cause). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c1)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2020-09-10 09:28:40 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1176394](show_bug.cgi?id=1176394 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - MozillaThunderbird-78.2.2-lp151.1.1 shows only empty home panel") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c2)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2020-09-10 09:33:36 UTC  ``` I've (hopefully) pulled the binaries from the project. I missed to disable publishing. 78.2.2 is not released from upstream yet and and the RC seems to have issues. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c3)  Paul Tannington   2020-09-10 09:51:26 UTC  ``` Could we have the previously working 78.2.1 back in the various <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/mozilla/>* repositories.  Users with 78.* profiles can't easily revert to V68.* ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c4)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2020-09-10 10:00:12 UTC  ``` Reverted the sources and started the builds. Don't know how it'll take. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c5)  Paul Tannington   2020-09-10 10:32:26 UTC  ``` OK... Thanks.  Hopefully the errant 78.2.2 won't have caught too many people out. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c6)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2020-09-10 10:42:35 UTC  ``` Is anyone open to try the corresponding upstream build for 78.2.2?  I'm really wondering if the whole issue is upstream or also in our package: <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/candidates/78.2.2-candidates/build1/linux-x86_64/en-US/thunderbird-78.2.2.tar.bz2> ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c7)  Paul Tannington   2020-09-10 11:06:58 UTC  ``` Sorry, don't have the time right now, might be able to try late evening...  Meanwhile, if it's of any use, this is earlier today from the error console when running the faulty (openSUSE build) of 78.2.2  <https://paste.opensuse.org/view/raw/506a5dd2> ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c8)  1st last   2020-09-10 14:12:32 UTC  ``` Revert to MozillaThunderbird-78.2.1-lp151.3.1.src.rpm works for me ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c9)  Paul Tannington   2020-09-11 08:09:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 841609](attachment.cgi?id=841609 "Screenshot of thunderbird-78.2.2.tar.bz2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=841609&action=edit "Screenshot of thunderbird-78.2.2.tar.bz2") Screenshot of thunderbird-78.2.2.tar.bz2  (In reply to Wolfgang Rosenauer from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c6)) > Is anyone open to try the corresponding upstream build for 78.2.2? >  > I'm really wondering if the whole issue is upstream or also in our package: > <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/candidates/78.2.2-candidates/build1/> > linux-x86_64/en-US/thunderbird-78.2.2.tar.bz2  OK... Apologies for the delay :)  Yes, that seems to work OK.  Set up a very minimal version with all TB defaults and only one mail account and all looks good.

Therefore it will break exactly the same way. Unfortunately I have no indication at all why that happens and what the difference between the upstream build and ours is. Within the package itself NOTHING changed between 78.2.1 and 78.2.2 but the upstream source tarball. Something changed there which triggers an issue. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c13)  Frank Krüger   2020-09-11 15:44:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Rosenauer from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c12)) > The version which was released upstream is exactly the one I had built as RC > before. > Therefore it will break exactly the same way. > Unfortunately I have no indication at all why that happens and what the > difference between the upstream build and ours is. > Within the package itself NOTHING changed between 78.2.1 and 78.2.2 but the > upstream source tarball.

Is there anything we could test to help you to fix the issue? ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c14)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2020-09-12 07:36:34 UTC  ``` Found the issue. It's affecting all Thunderbird builds of 78.2.2 with built-in updater disabled. Will wait a bit if upstream provides a patch. If that takes too long I'll create one but prefer to use upstream's if available. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1176384#c15)  Paul Tannington   2020-09-12 08:21:36 UTC  ``` Thanks for the update.
