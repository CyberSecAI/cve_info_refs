Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `lookatme` application automatically loading the `terminal` and `file_loader` extensions. These extensions allow for the execution of shell commands specified within the markdown source being rendered, which, if the markdown is from an untrusted source, can lead to arbitrary command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Default Behavior:** The automatic loading of extensions, especially those capable of executing shell commands, without explicit user consent or awareness, introduces a significant security risk.
*   **Lack of User Awareness:** Users might not be aware of the potential for arbitrary command execution when rendering markdown files from untrusted sources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious markdown file that includes shell commands, which are then executed when the file is rendered using `lookatme`.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Markdown Files:** An attacker can distribute a malicious markdown file to a user and trick the user into opening it with the `lookatme` application.
*   **Untrusted Sources:** The markdown file could come from untrusted sources, such as websites, email attachments, or shared repositories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Markdown:** The attacker needs the ability to create a markdown file with specially crafted code blocks using the `terminal` or `file` language.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious markdown file with the vulnerable `lookatme` application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed in `lookatme` version 2.3.0. The fix involves:
    *   No longer automatically loading built-in extensions.
    *   Requiring explicit user approval for loading extensions specified in the source markdown or through the `-e` or `LOOKATME_EXTS` env variables.
    *   Adding the ability to use the `--safe` option to prevent any new extensions specified in the source from loading.
    *   Adding the ability to use the `--no-ext-warn` to load extensions without warnings.
    *   Adding a soft requirement for a `user_warnings` function in all extensions to allow them to declare any security warnings.
    *   Adding the `-i` option to ignore extension load failures.
*   **Affected extensions**: The `terminal` and `file_loader` extensions are explicitly called out as being vulnerable. The `terminal` extension allows for the execution of terminal commands and the `file_loader` allows for the loading of external files, which can also contain malicious commands.
*   **User awareness is important**: The fix focuses on making the user aware of the risks of loading extensions from untrusted sources and allows the user to make the decision to load an extension.
*   **The `user_warnings()` function**: This forces extension developers to make the user aware of the potential risks of using their extension, this could include shell command execution.
