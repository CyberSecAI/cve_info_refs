Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-15949:

**Vulnerability:** Insufficient Authorization Controls

*   **Root Cause:** The Immuta application allows users to change their password without confirming their current password.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application lacks proper authorization checks during password update requests.
*  **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** A malicious actor with temporary access to an account could change the password and gain persistent access, locking out the legitimate user.
    *   **Chaining with other vulnerabilities:** This vulnerability can be chained with other client-side vulnerabilities, like XSS, to facilitate account compromise
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct exploitation:** An attacker with temporary access to an authenticated user session can directly issue an API request to change the user's password without knowing the old one.
    *   **Chaining with XSS:** An attacker could use XSS to steal a user's session token and then change the user's password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an active authenticated user session or be able to obtain a valid session token.
    *  Ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint
    * If chained with XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `/bim/iam/bim/user/<email>/password` endpoint.
*   A `PUT` request to this endpoint can change a user's password.
*   The application does not require the current password to be provided.
