- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Polarion subversion web application does not filter user input, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Additionally, the web interface lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - XSS vulnerability due to improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags.
    - CSRF vulnerability due to lack of CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **XSS**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed by the victim's browser, potentially leading to various actions within the web application.
    - **CSRF**: An attacker can trick an authenticated user into making unintended requests, potentially allowing them to read or modify content within the web application.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **XSS**: By enticing a user to click on a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript.
    - **CSRF**: By tricking a user into accessing a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **XSS**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript and entice the user to click on it.
    - **CSRF**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and trick an authenticated user into accessing it.
