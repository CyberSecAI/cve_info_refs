The content is related to CVE-2020-15302.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `getRequiredSignatures` function within the `RecoveryManager` contract of the Argent wallet. This function calculates the number of signatures required to initiate a wallet recovery. For wallets with no guardians, the function incorrectly returns 0, allowing anyone to initiate the recovery process without any authorization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient validation:** The `getRequiredSignatures` function does not properly handle the case where a wallet has zero guardians, leading to an authorization bypass.
*   **Unrestricted Recovery Initiation:** The lack of required signatures for guardian-less wallets allows any attacker to trigger a wallet recovery.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Wallet Takeover:** Attackers could initiate the recovery process of vulnerable wallets and, after a 36-hour delay, finalize the recovery, thus gaining full control of the wallet and its funds.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if the wallet owner cancels the malicious recovery attempt, the attacker can continuously initiate new recovery attempts, locking the wallet for 36 hours each time, effectively preventing the owner from accessing their funds or adding a guardian to mitigate the attack, or managing positions in DeFi protocols such as Compound or Maker.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct Interaction with Smart Contracts:** The attacker interacts directly with the vulnerable `RecoveryManager` smart contract by calling the `executeRecovery` function, bypassing the intended authorization mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Basic understanding of Ethereum smart contracts:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
*   **Ability to send transactions:** The attacker must be able to send transactions to the Ethereum network.
*   **No privileged access needed:** The attacker does not need any special permissions or keys to execute the attack. They can exploit any wallet that meets the criteria (no guardians and upgraded to a specific `RecoveryManager` version).
