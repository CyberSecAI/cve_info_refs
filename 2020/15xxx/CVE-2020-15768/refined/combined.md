# Potential disclosure of session cookies via header reflection

## Affected product(s)

* Gradle Enterprise 2017.3 - 2020.2.4
* Gradle Enterprise Build Cache Node 1.0 - 9.2

## Severity

Critical

## Published at

2020-09-15

## Related CVE ID(s)

* [CVE-2020-15768](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15768)

## Description

Unrestricted HTTP header reflection in Gradle Enterprise allows remote attackers to obtain authentication cookies,
if they are able to discover a separate XSS vulnerability. This potentially allows an attacker to impersonate another user.

Gradle Enterprise affected application request paths:

* `/info/headers`
* `/cache-info/headers`
* `/admin-info/headers`
* `/distribution-broker-info/headers`

Gradle Enterprise Build Cache Node affected application request paths:

* `/cache-node-info/headers`
## Mitigation

The issue can be mitigated by upgrading to:

* Gradle Enterprise 2020.2.5
* Gradle Build Cache Node 9.3

Or alternatively by blocking the above request paths.

## Credit
