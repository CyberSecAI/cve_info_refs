Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unrestricted HTTP header reflection in Gradle Enterprise and Gradle Enterprise Build Cache Node.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application reflects HTTP headers in the response without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential disclosure of authentication cookies.
- Ability for an attacker to impersonate another user if they can also discover a separate XSS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a request to specific application paths that reflect headers:
    - `/info/headers`
    - `/cache-info/headers`
    - `/admin-info/headers`
    - `/distribution-broker-info/headers` (Gradle Enterprise)
    - `/cache-node-info/headers` (Gradle Enterprise Build Cache Node)
- Requires an attacker to also discover a separate XSS vulnerability in order to gain the full impact.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application paths
- Need to have knowledge of or be able to discover a separate XSS vulnerability to fully exploit the reflected headers.
