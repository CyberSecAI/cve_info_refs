Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-15160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the 'location' parameter when setting the location of a product in the catalog product edition page. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `location` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database. This is a blind SQLi because the attacker cannot directly see the results of the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, modify data, or even take control of the database server.
- The impact is categorized as "High".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `location` parameter on the Catalog Product edition page.
- An attacker could manipulate this parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to access the Catalog Product edition page in the PrestaShop application. The specific permissions required are not explicitly stated in the provided text.

**Additional details from content:**
- The vulnerability affects PrestaShop versions >= 1.7.5.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.6.8.
- The fix involves escaping the `location` and `ids` when setting the location, by using `pSQL()` which escapes special characters and by casting the ids to integer using `(int)`.
