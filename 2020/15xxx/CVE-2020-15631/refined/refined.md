Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the HNAP service of the D-Link DAP-1860 WiFi extender.
- Specifically, the device fails to properly validate user-supplied input within the SOAPAction header before using it in a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection. An attacker can inject malicious commands into the SOAPAction header, which will then be executed by the device's operating system.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with the privileges of the device.
- This can lead to a complete compromise of the device and potentially the network it is connected to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Adjacent Attack:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the target device to exploit this vulnerability.
- **HNAP Service:** The attack vector is the HNAP service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- **Bypass Authentication:** The attacker needs the ability to bypass existing authentication mechanisms (which this vulnerability provides).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by chung96vn, a security researcher from VinCSS (member of Vingroup), through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- D-Link has released a beta/hotfix firmware update (v1.04b05) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-20-879 and ZDI-CAN-10084 by the Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSS score is 8.0, with a vector string of AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a high severity.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with local network access, to completely compromise the D-Link DAP-1860 device.
