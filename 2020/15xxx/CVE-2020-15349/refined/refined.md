Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2020-15349**

*   **Root Cause:** The `com.binarynights.ForkLiftHelper` XPC helper tool did not implement any authorization checks on incoming XPC calls, allowing any process to invoke its exposed functions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization:** Lack of proper authorization in the XPC listener.
    *   **Exposed Privileged Functions:** The helper exposed functions like `changePermissions`, `changeOwner`, `moveItem`, `createDirectory` etc., which allow file system manipulation with root privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) from a regular user to root.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XPC Calls:** Attacker sends unauthorized XPC messages to the vulnerable helper.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local user access on the macOS system.
    *   Ability to send XPC messages.

**Detailed Explanation of Exploits:**

1.  **Setuid Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can copy an interpreter (e.g., python) to a user-writable location.
    *   Using the `changeOwner` XPC call, they set the owner of the copied interpreter to root.
    *   Using the `changePermissions` XPC call, the SUID bit is set on the copied interpreter.
    *   Executing the modified interpreter allows the attacker to spawn a root shell.

2.  **LaunchAgent Exploitation:**
    *   Using the exposed `moveItem` XPC call, an attacker can create a malicious LaunchAgent plist file in a user writable directory.
    *  The attacker then moves this plist file to the `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` directory, which will execute the malicious script as root when the system restarts.

**Partial Fix:**
The initial fix did not check if the calling application was compiled with the runtime flag (0x1000). This allowed attackers to load an older version of the application and perform a dylib injection attack, bypassing the partial fix.

**CVE-2020-27192**

*   **Root Cause:** The application and its helper were using the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement, which disabled library validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Entitlement Misuse:**  Use of `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` in both the main application and helper, which disables library validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Local Privilege Escalation through dylib injection.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Dylib Injection:** Attacker injects a malicious dylib into the Forklift process at load time.
    *   **XPC Calls:** After dylib injection, the injected code can send unauthorized XPC messages to the helper.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local user access on the macOS system.
    *   Ability to perform dylib injection.

**Detailed Explanation of Entitlements Exploit:**

* Due to the vulnerable entitlement, an attacker can bypass code signing and inject a malicious dylib into the forklift application.
* This injected library can then use the vulnerable XPC calls as mentioned above in CVE-2020-15349 to gain root access.

**Recommendations:**

*   Enforce authorization checks for XPC helper connections, verifying caller's code signature, runtime flags, and team ID.
*   Avoid using the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement.
*   Check and secure entitlements within the application.
