Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15051:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15051. The github repository, `pratikshad19/CVE-2020-15051`,  explicitly states: "CVE-2020-15051 : Artica Proxy before 4.30.000000 Community Edition allows Stored Cross Site Scripting." This aligns with the CVE description of a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in Artica Proxy.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in several fields within the Artica Proxy web interface.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to neutralize special characters within user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (access to user cookies and other session data)
    *   Defacement of the web interface
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious actions within the user's session
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through multiple input fields of the web interface. The fields specified in the provided text are:
    *   Server Domain Name
    *   Your Email Address
    *   Group Name
    *  MySQL Server
    *   Database
    *   MySQL Username
    *   Task Description
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of Artica Proxy
    *   The attacker needs to be able to input text into the vulnerable fields and save them.
    * No specific privileges are mentioned in the report but access to a user that can modify those fields would be required.
* **Additional Notes:**
   * The provided github repository mentions the vulnerability is present in Artica Proxy before version 4.28.030418 Community Edition, however, the title specifies "Artica Proxy before 4.30.000000 Community Edition", this could indicate that the fix was not complete with the first patch
   * The exploit author provides a sample payload: `<svg/onload=alert(1)>`. This payload is a commonly used XSS proof of concept, that triggers a javascript alert dialog when the svg tag with the onload attribute is rendered by the browser.

**3. Additional Information:**

The provided content also includes documentation related to GitHub and its services, which are not directly relevant to CVE-2020-15051, but provide context on the source of the information. The Artica Proxy website provides information about the product itself.

**In summary, the provided content confirms the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability in Artica Proxy due to a lack of input sanitization. Exploitation can lead to session hijacking and other malicious actions through injection of malicious Javascript.**
