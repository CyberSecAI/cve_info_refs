{
  "CVE-2020-15121": {
    "Description": "Malformed PDB file names in the PDB server path cause shell injection.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The radare2 PDB downloader uses `r_sys_cmd` or `r_sys_cmdf` with unsanitized input, allowing shell injection when a crafted PDB file path is present.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Command injection",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the victim's system.",
    "Attack vectors": "By opening a PE file with a malformed debug symbol information(PDB).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a PE file with a specially crafted, malicious PDB path. The victim then needs to open the malicious PE file in radare2 and execute `idpd` command."
