Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `CachingHttpClient` class in the Symfony HTTP client component used the `HttpCache` class for handling requests. The `HttpCache` class utilized internal headers (like `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File`) to manage the restoration of cached responses. These headers were designed for surrogate caching and ESI where all calls are made from a trusted backend. However, `CachingHttpClient` made it possible for an attacker to control the response, which could lead to remote code execution when these internal headers were processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Headers:** The `HttpCache` class was not properly sanitizing or removing internal headers from responses received from external sources.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability allowed for potential remote code execution by using the `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File` headers.
*   **Trust Assumption:** The initial design of `HttpCache` assumed all HTTP calls came from a trusted backend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server by controlling the response of a request made by the `CachingHttpClient`.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE could lead to full compromise of the server and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker can be remote over the network.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker would need to intercept or manipulate the response from a remote server that is subsequently cached by the `CachingHttpClient`.
*   **Compromised Resource:** An attacker could compromise the remote server and manipulate responses to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Control Over HTTP Response:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or control the HTTP response that is being cached by the `CachingHttpClient`.
*   **Low Privilege Access:** The attacker needs low privileges on the vulnerable system to exploit this.
*   **User Interaction Required:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Symfony versions 4.3.0 before 4.4.13 and 5.1.0 before 5.1.5 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** Symfony versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5 and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves stripping internal headers (`X-Body-Eval`, `X-Body-File`, `X-Content-Digest`) from the responses before they are passed to `HttpCache`.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability has been rated as **High severity**.
