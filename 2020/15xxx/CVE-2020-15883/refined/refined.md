Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The application fails to properly escape dangerous characters from the URL parameters when building the page, leading to potential execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:**  The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS in the `managedinstalls` module. The application reflects user-supplied input from URL parameters directly into the HTML output without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session.
- **Client Code Execution:** Attackers can perform actions within the application as if they were the user, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Links:** The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript. A user clicking such a link will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a crafted, malicious link, likely by embedding it in an email or other communication methods.
- **No Authentication Required**: While the application has authentication features, exploitation of this XSS does not require the attacker to be authenticated, meaning they can trigger this attack on any user who visits the malicious link

**Versions Affected:**
- MunkiReport versions from 2.5.3 to 5.6.2 are vulnerable.
**Mitigation:**
- **Upgrade MunkiReport:** The preferred method is to upgrade MunkiReport to the latest version.
- **Update managedinstalls Module:** If a full update isn't possible, updating the `managedinstalls` module to version 2.6 mitigates the vulnerability.
- **Disable managedinstalls Module:** If updates are not feasible, disabling the `managedinstalls` module can also prevent exploitation.
