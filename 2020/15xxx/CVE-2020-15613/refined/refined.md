- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input in the `line` parameter within the `ajax_admin_apis.php` file before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands into a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of root on affected CentOS Web Panel installations, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated access to the vulnerable `ajax_admin_apis.php` endpoint via a crafted `line` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests to the specified endpoint. No prior authentication is required.
