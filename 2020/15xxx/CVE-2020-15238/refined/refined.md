  "CVE-2020-15238": {
    "description": "The DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of arguments passed to the DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Argument Injection",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root, denial of service (DoS) by bringing down network interfaces, or arbitrary script execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local attacker sending crafted D-Bus messages to the blueman-mechanism service."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user access is required to exploit the vulnerability. If Polkit is enabled with default configurations, the attacker would need to be part of the wheel group. However, without Polkit, any local user can exploit the vulnerability."

    "affected_packages": {
      "affected_versions": "< 2.1.4",
      "unaffected_versions": ">= 2.1.4",
       "fix_details":"Patches were applied to version 2.1.4 which changed the D-Bus method to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. Backports were made to 2.0.8."
      },
    "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability is more severe on systems where Polkit-1 is disabled or misconfigured.",
        "The vulnerability can be exploited in different ways depending on the system's DHCP client (ISC DHCP client or dhcpcd).",
        "The blueman package had a packaging bug where Polkit-1 support was not being enabled during builds, even though the package recommends policykit-1."
