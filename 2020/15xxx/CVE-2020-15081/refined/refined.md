Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing `index.php` file in the `upload` directory of PrestaShop. This allows for directory listing, which exposes the contents of the upload directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of files within the `upload` directory due to the lack of an `index.php` file to prevent directory listing. This is also described as "Information Exposure Through Directory Listing"
- **Lack of proper access control:** Absence of a mechanism (like an `index.php` or `.htaccess` file) to prevent direct access to the file directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the upload directory by browsing it. This could include uploaded images, documents, or other files which were not intended to be publicly viewable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Directory Access:** The attacker can directly access the upload directory using a web browser or a tool by navigating to the path.
- **No specific attacker capabilities/position are needed.** Anyone with knowledge of the target's URL can exploit this.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix is the addition of an `index.php` file to prevent directory browsing. The `index.php` file redirects to the parent directory to prevent the vulnerability. Additionally, the `.gitignore` file is updated to include the `index.php`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.6.6 of PrestaShop.
- A temporary workaround is provided:  Add an empty index.php file in the upload directory.
- The severity is marked as "Low".
