{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web portal of the Askey AP5100W Access Point lacks input validation and sanitization in the network analysis feature, allowing injection and execution of OS commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS command injection vulnerability",
       "Lack of input validation and sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the AP, extract sensitive data such as password hashes, gain unauthorized root access to the AP via SSH or Telnet, and install malicious programs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "By sending a crafted GET request to the web portal with malicious commands injected via the 'NETWORK_ANALYSIS_METHOD' parameter.",
        "Exploiting the lack of input validation in the network analysis tool."

    ],
   "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the access point or have obtained access to the network. An understanding of web requests and linux command injection techniques is required."
