Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15378:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the exposure of docker container ports to the network when IPv6 networking is enabled on Brocade SANnav. This issue is related to the underlying operating system configuration of the OVA version of SANnav, rather than a direct vulnerability within the SANnav product itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unnecessary Network Exposure:** Enabling IPv6 on the SANnav OVA leads to numerous docker container ports being unnecessarily exposed to the network. This increases the attack surface.
*   **OS Configuration Issue:** The core of the problem lies within the underlying operating system's configuration within the SANnav OVA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Increased Attack Surface:** The exposure of container ports increases the potential attack surface, making it easier for an attacker to attempt to exploit other vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** The exposed ports may provide avenues for an attacker to probe for and exploit vulnerabilities within the containers themselves or the services they provide.
*   **Confidentiality Loss:** Although the CVSS score indicates low confidentiality impact, it is not impossible that an exposed service can disclose sensitive information if compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based since the vulnerable ports are exposed on the network when IPv6 is enabled.
*   **Remote access:** The ports may be accessible from other network segments depending on network configuration

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to reach the exposed ports on the SANnav server.
*   **Knowledge of Exposed Services:** The attacker would also need some knowledge of the services exposed on the ports to attempt exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is addressed in SANnav 2.1.1 and later versions of the OVA.
*   The advisory recommends that customers with non-OVA SANnav deployments check their kernel configuration.
*   The advisory does not detail specific services or ports exposed by this vulnerability.
