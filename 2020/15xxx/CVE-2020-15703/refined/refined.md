Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how `aptdaemon` handles the `Locale` property. It incorrectly processes locale settings, allowing a local attacker to exploit this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for information disclosure. By manipulating the `Locale` property, a local attacker can probe the system for the presence of local files. This implies that the system does not properly validate the locale, allowing the attacker to specify a path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A successful attack could allow a local attacker to test for the existence of specific files on the system, potentially revealing sensitive information about the system's configuration and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target machine.
- **Manipulating Locale:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the `Locale` property. The specific method of manipulation isn't detailed beyond the fact that it involves the locale parameter to `aptdaemon`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the target system.
- **Ability to Interact with aptdaemon:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with `aptdaemon` in a manner that allows them to influence the Locale parameter of the service.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided patch `debian/patches/CVE-2020-15703.patch` mitigates the issue by rejecting locales with full paths in `aptdaemon/core.py`.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Ubuntu versions: 20.04 LTS, 18.04 ESM, and 16.04 ESM.
- The update requires a system reboot after package updates to ensure changes take effect.
