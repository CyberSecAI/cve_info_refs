Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of authentication attempts. Specifically, the affected devices truncate the provided password to match a set number of characters, rather than validating against the entire password string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Password Truncation:** The core weakness is the truncation of passwords during authentication, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass security measures.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability can be classified as an authentication bypass by a primary weakness (CWE-305), as the truncated password bypasses normal authentication procedures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and gain unauthorized access to the Sm@rt Server.
*   **Potential for Further Malicious Activity:** Once access is gained, an attacker could potentially perform further malicious actions, depending on the system's functionality and the attacker's goals. The advisory itself only mentions the ability to obtain access, but doesn't elaborate on secondary impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Brute-Force Attack:** The primary attack vector involves a remote attacker attempting to brute-force user passwords by exploiting the password truncation vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the affected device (SIMATIC HMI Panels) to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No Prior Privileges:** The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges to launch the attack, as stated by the CVSS vector.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Specific Products Affected:** The vulnerability affects SIMATIC HMI Unified Comfort Panels, specifically versions <= V16.
*  **Mitigation:** The advisory recommends updating to V16 Update 5 to resolve the issue. Additionally, for Uniﬁed Comfort Panels using SmartClient, complex passwords are recommended, as the password truncation cannot be resolved due to RFC 6143 and is limited to 8 characters.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3, indicating a medium severity.

**Summary of CVE-2020-15787:**

This CVE identifies a password truncation vulnerability in Siemens SIMATIC HMI Unified Comfort Panels that allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by brute-forcing passwords due to the devices not validating the whole provided string. It is addressed with a software update.
