calls for a rigorous and continuous Security Management
process with:
• Risk analysis including definition of countermeasures

aimed at reducing the risk to an acceptable level
• Coordinated organizational / technical measures
• Regular / event-driven repetition

• Products, systems and processes must meet applicable
duty-of-care requirements, based on laws, standards,

Risk analysis is the first step to determine security measures

The risk analysis is an important precondition for Security
Management relating to a plant or machine, aimed at identifying
and assessing individual hazards and risks.

Typical content of a risk analysis
• Identification of threatened objects
• Analysis of value and damage potential
• Threat and weak points analysis
• Identification of existing security measures
• Risk assessment

The identified and unacceptable risks must be ruled out or reduced
by applying compensating measures.

Which risks are ultimately acceptable can only be specified
individually for the application concerned.

Network Security
Secure network design for protection
of automation systems

Continuous communication from control to field level
is more important than ever, reflected in current trends
such as digital twin or industrial IoT. However, complete
connectivity presents higher levels of risk, which have
to be addressed with security measures:

Separation between production and office networks
• Secure access via demilitarized zone

Usage of cell protection concept
• Segmentation of production in protected cells

Secured remote control for service and maintenance
• Authenticated and authorized access

Secured connection to cloud solutions
• Access protection and secured data transfer

Network Security
Separation of production and office networks

• The first step in network segmentation is strict separation
between the production networks and the other company
networks

• In the simplest case, separation is provided by means
of a single firewall system that controls and regulates
communication between the networks

• In the more secure variant, the link is realized via a

separate network, the so called demilitarized zone (DMZ),
respective perimeter network.

• Direct communication between the production and the
company networks is completely blocked by firewalls;
communication can take place only indirectly via servers
in the DMZ network

Network Security
Criteria for Network Segmentation

• With a cell protection concept a network segment is protected from

external unauthorized access.

• Data transfer within a cell is not controlled by a Security Appliance

and is assumed to be secure or complemented with protection
measures within the cell.

• A cell contains only components with the same protection

requirements.

• Network structure should be derived from the production process.
This allows for the definition of cells with less communication across
cell borders and with minimum firewall approvals.

Page 24

© Siemens 2024 | Version 2.2 | April 2024

• All devices of a PROFINET

system belongs to a single cell

• Devices with a high rate of
communication  should be
combined in a common cell

• External components that only
communicate with devices in a
single cell should be integrated
into the cell if their protection
requirements allow.

• Limit communication based

on actual need
 „Need-to-connect“ principle

Network Security
Example: Network segmentation
with Security Appliances

Alternatively or complementary
to Industrial Security Appliances,
SIMATIC S7 and PC Communication
Processors (CP) can be used
with "Security Integrated“
functionality (firewall and VPN)
for the protection of automated
devices and cells.

S7 communication processors
protect underlying networks by
an integrated firewall.

Additionally, encrypted VPN
connections can be established
directly to the SIMATIC S7-1200,
S7-1500 or Distributed Controller
ET 200SP.

Possible risks and recommended measures

Risks

Measures

• Unauthorized access

Security Mechanisms

• Deterioration in

equipment availability
due to network overload

• Espionage / manipulation
of data transfer between
automation systems

• Division of the automation network into appropriate network segments

and control of incoming and outgoing data traffic by a firewall
(perimeter security). For example, critical network protocols can
be blocked.

• Bandwidth restriction, for example in a cell firewall or in switches.

Network overload from outside the cell cannot affect devices inside
the cell.

• Data transfer via non-secure networks, e.g. between cells or from

clients to cells, can be encrypted and authenticated with the Security or
VPN Appliance that controls access to the cell.

System Integrity
Access protection for configuration (Engineering)

In order to prevent unauthorized configuration changes
to automation components, it is highly recommended
to make use of the integrated access protection
mechanisms.

Plant security

This includes for example:
• Firewalls (User authentication)
• WLAN Access Points (User authentication)
• Managed Switches (User authentication)
• HMI Panels (Access protection for device settings)
• PLCs (Protection levels for configuration and HMI access)
• Drives (Know-how protection).

Use of components with integrated security features such
as the S7-1500 controller or SINUMERIK ONE

Use various passwords that are as secure as possible
(if possible at least 12 upper- and lower-case characters, numbers and where applicable special characters)

For easier password handling a common password manager is recommended. In case of coordination among
multiple persons this one should be stored on a central network share including access rights.

Page 34

© Siemens 2024 | Version 2.2 | April 2024

System Integrity
Access protection for operations (Runtime)

• Since a plant or machinery is usually operated by more than one person,

central user administration is recommended.

• User accounts / groups

• This is based on user accounts of a Windows domain or a Windows Active

• Policies

Directory. SIMATIC (HMI) runtime applications are connected via SIMATIC Logon
or UMC.

• Specifying / enforcing security guidelines (e.g. password validity, monitoring

of incorrect logging on, etc.)

• Central user administration simplifies regular review of access authorizations

(e.g. identifying disused accounts)

• Independent Windows domains can be used to meet the security requirements

of segregated networks.

• Depending on required roles (operator, administrator, etc.) user accounts can

be restricted to the minimum required operating rights.

Page 35

© Siemens 2024 | Version 2.2 | April 2024

System Integrity
Access protection for network components (Network)

Access protection for networks by means of
• Port Security with Switch Ports: MAC or IP access lists restrict access
• Port Security with central device administration and RADIUS authentication (802.1X)
• Perimeter security of a network in relation to other networks (e.g. Internet) with firewalls

System Integrity
System hardening reduces possible attack scenarios

Network Services

HW & System Interfaces

User Accounts

• Active network services are a potential

• Hardware interfaces constitute a risk if

security risk in general

• To minimize risks, only the services that

are actually required should be
activated on automation components.

• All activated services (especially

Webserver, FTP, Remote Desktop, etc.)
should be taken into account  in the
security concept

• Hardening measures (network

robustness and security-by-default
settings) in automation and drives
products enhance security without the
need for separate user configuration

unauthorized access via them to
equipment or the system is possible.
Therefore unused interfaces should be
deactivated:
• USB, Ethernet/PROFINET ports
• WLAN, Bluetooth, Mobile Comm.

• Protection by deactivation or at least

mechanical blocking

• Deactivate booting and Autostart
mechanisms of external media

• Activate access protection to BIOS- /

UEFI settings

• Only use remote management, like

AMT, in a secured manner

• Every active user account enables
access to the system and is thus a
potential risk

• Reduce configured / activated user
accounts to the minimum necessary

• Use secure access data for existing

accounts

• Audit accounts, particularly locally
configured user accounts, regularly

System Integrity
Patch management fixes security vulnerabilities in operating
system and applications

Many security attacks nowadays take place via weak points for which the manufacturers already
have patches. Zero day exploits are encountered rarely, where the weak point is not yet known
or updates are not available.

• The installation of patches and updates is an important measure to enhance security

• Siemens supports compatibility tests of Microsoft security patches:

Internal distribution
of Microsoft Patches

Download of
Microsoft Patches

• SIMATIC PCS 7:  http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/22754447

• SIMATIC WinCC: http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/18752994

• System-specific compatibility tests recommended

• Patch distribution via central patch server in DMZ and

Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).

Industrial Security Services

• Set up of update groups and processes for online update
simplifies patch distribution (e.g. for redundant systems).

System Integrity
Firmware updates for more security within automation devices

• Even such automation components that do not use a standard PC operating system may require

software updates to fix security related vulnerabilities.

• Information is available at our Siemens Industrial Security website

(http://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity) as well as our product newsletters or RSS feeds.

• As soon as information on a vulnerability becomes available, it should be evaluated for relevance

to the application concerned

• Depending thereon, it can be decided whether further measures should be taken:

• No action, as existing measures provide sufficient protection
• Additional external measures in order to uphold the security level
• Installation of latest firmware updates to eliminate the weak point

• The procedure is comparable with a risk analysis, as described earlier in the presentation,

but with restricted focus

System Integrity
Identifying / preventing malware with virus scanners

Suitable antivirus software should be used to identify malware and to prevent
further spreading.

Depending on the particular case, certain aspects should however be taken into
account:

• Performance loss due to scan procedure (e.g. only automatic scan of incoming data

transfer and manual scan during maintenance periods)

• Regular updating of virus signatures – if applicable via central server

• Availability must generally be assured even in the case of infection with malware.

This means that the virus scanner must under no circumstances:

• Remove files or block access thereto or move into Quarantine

• Block communication

• Shut down systems

• McAfee

Industrial Security Services

• Symantec

• Trend Micro

Further information is available
in the Siemens compatibility tool:
http://www.siemens.com/kompatool

*)  Please note: The compatibility must be verified

for each specific configuration

System Integrity
Identifying / preventing malware by whitelisting

Basic principle

• Whitelisting mechanisms provide additional protection against undesired

applications or malware, as well as unauthorized changes to installed applications

• Whitelisting software creates or contains a list of programs and applications

that are allowed to run on the PC

• Software that is not listed in this “white list“ is prevented from running.

Advantages

• No regular or delayed pattern updates

• Additional protection mechanism

• Higher Protection against specific types of malware

• McAfee Application Control

Engineering
Projekt

System Integrity
Access protection of industrial project files

Project files for industrial automation solutions (e.g. Engineering Project files)
often contain internal know-how, which shall not fall into foreign hands. You should
therefore  protect and prevent from disclosure industrial project files by consider
the following guidelines:

• Protect project files at rest (e.g.: access protection using file system rights; storage

in an encrypted drive container)

• Encrypt project files when they are in transit (e.g. via e-mail encryption or encrypted

ZIP archives)

• Enforce the need to know principle

• Assess and configure security measures that are connected with online services

to test for malicious files carefully. Otherwise industrial project files might be uploaded
unintentionally and automatically to external systems. This is for example related
to 3rd party automated e-mail gateway scanners, Endpoint Protection Systems,
DLPs or IDSs.

Reviews and improvements
After implementation of all planned measures a Security Audit is conducted
to ensure that

• measures have been put into practice as scheduled,
• these measures reduce the identified risks as expected.

Depending on the results, measures can be changed / added in order
to attain the necessary security.

Repeat the risk analysis
Due to the changes in security threats, regular repetition of the risk
analysis is required in order to ensure the security of plant / machinery.

• Following certain occurrences (expansion of or changes to plant /

machinery, significant changes in security threats, etc.)

• Annual check of whether a new risk analysis is required.

Security information

Siemens provides products and solutions with industrial security functions that support the secure operation of plants,
systems, machines and networks. In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks against cyber threats, it is
necessary to implement – and continuously maintain – a holistic, state-of-the-art industrial security concept. Siemens’
products and solutions constitute one element of such a concept.

Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Such
systems, machines and components should only be connected to an enterprise network or the internet if and to the extent
such a connection is necessary and only when appropriate security measures (e.g. firewalls and/or network segmentation)
are in place.
For additional information on industrial security measures that may be implemented, please visit
https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity.

Siemens’ products and solutions undergo continuous development to make them more secure. Siemens strongly
recommends that product updates are applied as soon as they are available and that the latest product versions are used.
Use of product versions that are no longer supported, and failure to apply the latest updates may increase customer’s
exposure to cyber threats.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15786

Affected devices insufﬁciently block excessive authentication attempts.
