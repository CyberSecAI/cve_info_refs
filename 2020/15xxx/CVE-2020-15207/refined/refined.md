  "CVE-2020-15207": {
    "description": "In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, to mimic Python's indexing with negative values, TFLite uses `ResolveAxis` to convert negative values to positive indices. However, the only check that the converted index is now valid is only present in debug builds. If the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution moves ahead with a negative index. This, in turn, results in accessing data out of bounds which results in segfaults and/or data corruption.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing validation in the `ResolveAxis` function within TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). This function converts negative indices to positive ones to mimic Python's indexing behavior. However, the check to ensure the resulting index is within bounds was only present in debug builds, which leads to out-of-bounds access in release builds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read/write"
    ],
    "impact": "Accessing data out of bounds can lead to segmentation faults (crashes) or data corruption. This can result in denial of service or unexpected behavior of the affected software.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted TFLite model with negative indices for tensors can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft and deploy a malicious TFLite model."
