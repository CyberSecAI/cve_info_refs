{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `send(ftp, msg)` function in the `asyncftpclient` library allows the `msg` parameter to contain CR-LF control characters. This lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary FTP commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CRLF Injection (CWE-93)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary FTP commands by controlling the input to the `send()` function. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions on the FTP server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects malicious FTP commands via unchecked arguments such as username and password during the establishment of an `AsyncFtpClient` connection.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the input to the `newAsyncFtpClient` function, specifically the username or password parameters, to inject CR-LF sequences. This usually means the attacker controls user-supplied input which is then passed to this function."
  },
  "fix": {
    "description": "The fix involves properly validating user input, and raising an exception if `CR` or `LF` characters are found within the `msg` passed to the `send()` function.",
    "version": "Fixed in version 1.2.6"
  }
