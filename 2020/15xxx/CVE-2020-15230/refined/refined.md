Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of percent-encoded relative paths within the `FileMiddleware` component of the Vapor framework. Specifically, the middleware failed to correctly sanitize or normalize the path before using it to access files on the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By using percent-encoded relative paths (e.g., `%2e%2e/`), attackers could bypass the intended restrictions and access files outside of the designated public directory. The `FileMiddleware` did not properly handle these encoded paths, leading to the ability to navigate up the directory tree.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read any file on the server's file system that the application user has access to. This could potentially expose sensitive data like configuration files, source code, or database credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out via crafted HTTP requests. The attacker manipulates the URL path by including percent-encoded relative path components (e.g., `%2e%2e/`, `%2e%2e%2f`). The `FileMiddleware` then processes this modified path without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is present in the `FileMiddleware`, which typically handles static file serving. Exploitation doesn't require authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in pull request [#2223](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/2223) and fixed by pull request [#2500](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/2500).
- The fix was released in version 4.29.4 of the Vapor framework.
- The vulnerability affects versions between 4.0.0-rc.2.5 and 4.29.3.
- The fix involves ensuring the path is absolute before it is used to access files on the file system.
- The fix added a test case to verify the path traversal protection by using a percent encoded relative path.
