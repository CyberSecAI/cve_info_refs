Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15511:

**CVE-2020-15511:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of symlinks within Terraform workers.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Symlink Handling Issue:** The core weakness lies in how Terraform workers process symbolic links. This could potentially allow malicious actors to manipulate the file system in unexpected ways.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to files or directories, potentially leading to data exposure, modification, or other forms of system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerability through manipulated or malicious Terraform configurations which contain symlinks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need to be able to influence the Terraform configuration that is being executed by a vulnerable Terraform worker. This could involve modifying existing configurations or providing new malicious configurations that are then executed by the worker. This could involve access to the system running the worker or access to the Terraform configuration source.
