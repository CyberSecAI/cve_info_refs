Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15932

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a vulnerability in the Overwolf update mechanism. It is susceptible to file redirection attacks via symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is the improper handling of symbolic links during the update process, which allows for file redirection. This is a classic example of a symlink attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a standard user to elevate privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This means an attacker can gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the update process using symbolic links.
- Standard users can trigger this vulnerability through multiple methods. The advisory mentions multiple bypasses, which indicate that the initial fix was not sufficient.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be a standard user on the system. This means they do not require any prior elevated privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links, which is generally available to standard users.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows a standard user to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level by manipulating the Overwolf update process with symbolic links, enabling them to redirect files and gain complete control of the system. The vendor released a patch after multiple bypass attempts were discovered.
