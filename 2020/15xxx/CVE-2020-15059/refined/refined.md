{
  "CVE-2020-15059": {
    "Root cause": "The web interface of the USB network server does not properly validate if a password was sent with a request. By removing the password parameter from a request, the server interprets it as no password being set and performs the action.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to missing password validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthenticated users can access and execute privileged functions on the administrative interface, effectively disabling access controls.",
     "Attack vectors": "Sending an HTTP POST request to the web interface without the password parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the device and be able to send HTTP requests to the server's web interface."
