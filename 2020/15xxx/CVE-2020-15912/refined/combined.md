[00:00] hi today i'd like to share my experience
[00:03] on how to relay nfc traffic
[00:06] for tesla model 3 and
[00:10] okay so yeah okay so my name is
[00:13] kevin 2600 i currently working for a
[00:16] company
[00:17] called in geek in shanghai china and we
[00:20] are focused on research and fan testing
[00:22] for smart car security
[00:24] we also built a project called car src
[00:27] and which is china first car security
[00:29] response center
[00:31] yeah so you're welcome to uh follow me
[00:34] on twitter on kevin2600 or just
[00:37] if you're interested and check out a
[00:40] barcode here
[00:41] for company website right okay so
[00:45] um here's other contents for today
[00:48] first i like to talk about some basic
[00:50] knowledge um
[00:52] and the applications regarding to nfc
[00:55] and then oh i think maybe i should
[01:01] uh and then i will talk about the key
[01:04] fobs
[01:06] architecture for tesla model 3 and
[01:09] eventually i walk
[01:10] through the challenge we have faced
[01:13] and how do we bypass it and do it during
[01:16] the nfc relay research
[01:18] right so nfc 101
[01:22] i don't think we need to talk about too
[01:24] much unless
[01:25] at this point because a lot of people
[01:27] already know
[01:28] about nfc but basically nfc is a stand
[01:32] for
[01:32] near field communication he most likely
[01:35] operating on passive mode and it's
[01:38] really
[01:39] working in close range we're talking
[01:42] about centimeters here
[01:44] and the operation frequency usually is
[01:46] going to be
[01:47] 13.56 megahertz and that you can using
[01:51] and the things called an ef to change
[01:54] the
[01:55] data back forth right so um
[01:58] the nfc technology is already widely
[02:01] developed
[02:02] right so we can see a lot of application
[02:04] based
[02:05] on it in today's world so for example
[02:07] our payment system
[02:09] our passport and our card for access our
[02:13] business buildings are all most likely
[02:16] uh
[02:17] nfc or r5d based
[02:20] so and then there's a new trend for
[02:22] using mc for car keys
[02:25] and here's some of car manufacture
[02:27] already using it
[02:28] as we can see um like bmw
[02:31] or byd and like our main target today
[02:35] tesla
[02:36] they were using it and they come with
[02:39] different
[02:39] size uh forms right so
[02:42] um interestingly even apple has enabled
[02:46] a new feature
[02:46] called car key for the latest right so
[02:50] yeah
[02:51] i think the digital uh carcass
[02:54] is really uh the future and
[02:59] now speaking of tesla elon musk is so
[03:02] proud of it
[03:03] he mentioned that tesla is a
[03:05] sophisticated computer on wheels
[03:07] right so if his computer the hackers or
[03:11] skill research
[03:12] will be interested in it and so here's a
[03:15] small list
[03:16] that i grabbed from tesla website as you
[03:19] can see there are many research
[03:22] researchers has found vulnerability and
[03:24] report to tesla for the past few years
[03:27] and so for example
[03:32] oh sorry okay so for example the famous
[03:36] hacks from kensington labs
[03:38] they they were able to export the wi-fi
[03:41] stack on tesla model s
[03:43] and then they also done great experiment
[03:47] um tesla autopilot so if you guys are
[03:50] interesting
[03:50] i recommend that you check it out also
[03:53] um there's some some more independent
[03:56] researcher
[03:57] so for example one guy called richie zhu
[03:59] he won the
[04:01] last year pangsuong competition he
[04:04] basically able to
[04:05] punk the tesla ivi system
[04:08] also there is another researcher from
[04:11] biochem
[04:11] he's able to successfully uh crack
[04:15] the key the encryptions of used by tesla
[04:18] model s
[04:19] and you know and then he able to
[04:22] successfully clone the entire key
[04:26] so i think this is a quite quite cool
[04:29] right
[04:30] um but however
[04:34] turns out that not just hackers or skill
[04:36] researchers
[04:37] are interested in tesla so
[04:40] those thefts right but they don't care
[04:43] about how to write
[04:45] perfect exploits for rce they only want
[04:48] to steal the vehicles
[04:50] or something left inside right
[04:53] so they only want to some very simple
[04:56] way
[04:57] and turns out that one of the simplest
[04:58] way for them is called a key file relay
[05:01] attack
[05:02] i think this is all over the news for
[05:04] the past few
[05:06] months or even last year because
[05:09] you you're gonna see uh some guy come to
[05:12] your neighborhood
[05:13] with some mystery device now that you
[05:15] can amplify your key
[05:17] key fob and then turn on somehow turn on
[05:20] your
[05:21] vehicles and drive away so and this is
[05:24] also the reason why
[05:25] we start to research on tesla because
[05:28] we're going to try to see
[05:30] if it's possible to do the nfc relay for
[05:33] for the tesla mod 3 right okay
[05:37] um so
[05:40] tesla keefa architecture so let's talk
[05:43] about this
[05:44] uh okay so before i start i would like
[05:46] to talk about some
[05:48] research procedures well the first
[05:52] usually when we start to research
[05:54] something we
[05:55] usually start with some recurrence recon
[05:58] right
[05:58] so basically at this stage we try to
[06:01] read as many as possible the menus
[06:04] regarding your target and also you can
[06:06] sit down with your
[06:08] friends your colleagues and to
[06:11] do some brainstorming to see what kind
[06:13] of attack factors
[06:15] that you can have right and once you
[06:18] have lots
[06:18] ready then you can really just uh
[06:21] sit down and actually implement some
[06:24] attack plans
[06:25] and and then you can go to uh actually
[06:29] uh doing it right so
[06:33] usually when when we're testing for uh
[06:36] like tesla here we we by not expecting
[06:39] that i will it will success in the first
[06:42] time
[06:43] so usually it will fail but that's okay
[06:46] um we just try harder and repeat
[06:48] eventually we'll find something right
[06:50] cool
[06:52] so um for tesla and
[06:56] now in order to access the model 3 tesla
[06:59] has provided us
[07:00] three different ways like for example we
[07:03] can use
[07:03] nfc tag and tesla
[07:07] also providing uh mobile apps
[07:11] for us to using to try to control your
[07:14] car
[07:15] through bluetooth and later they also
[07:18] provided
[07:19] the physical key fob also happened using
[07:21] bluetooth and
[07:22] nfc here okay
[07:26] and just like any other radio device
[07:28] tesla kfubs we can find a thing called
[07:31] fcc id so this is important for us
[07:35] at a recon stage because first we need
[07:38] to
[07:39] know much as much as possible regarding
[07:41] your
[07:42] your target right so as if from here we
[07:46] can
[07:46] we can uh we search through the ftc id
[07:49] to the website
[07:50] and then we can find uh say for example
[07:54] we can find that
[07:55] uh just a month three key fob using the
[07:58] cc2640
[07:59] chipset and also this is also for
[08:03] for a kifa reader a
[08:06] read module and i also happen to use in
[08:09] cc2640 so by this information really we
[08:12] can have
[08:12] even without even actually open up uh
[08:16] you when you have
[08:17] even without own one of these uh
[08:19] vehicles you already
[08:21] know something about it right that's
[08:23] pretty cool
[08:24] now um regarding the
[08:27] icky tag itself um
[08:31] it actually uh is
[08:34] just a like any other nfc
[08:37] tag he port iso one four four four
[08:41] three type a and also iso seven eight
[08:44] sixteen
[08:46] four um standards
[08:49] and basically the java smart cards so
[08:52] we can use in uh some uh
[08:55] ready or already exist application to to
[09:00] grab those informations right there's a
[09:02] lot of application can do as you can see
[09:04] here
[09:05] um yeah the the difference between those
[09:08] two
[09:09] iso standards uh one is contact
[09:12] and one is contacts um they are very
[09:15] similar
[09:16] and on top of application layer they all
[09:19] send so using aptu to talk to your car
[09:23] okay so and and then
[09:26] i recommend that people uh
[09:30] serious about researching on rfid
[09:33] security
[09:34] you definitely need to go get one of the
[09:36] pn at post mark 3.
[09:39] um yeah i think this is very important
[09:41] so basically
[09:42] we can use in pm3 to um to identify
[09:46] your your targets which is uh
[09:50] keef up here and i can see he identified
[09:53] as a
[09:54] an xp myfair deathfire 4k
[09:59] um ev1 type car
[10:03] okay so and here's our little
[10:06] uh summary here so the tesla nfc key tag
[10:09] is seven bytes
[10:10] uh he uses seven bytes uid and is
[10:14] it is a java based card
[10:18] the most important part is here is
[10:20] actually using
[10:21] ecdh for a challenging response for
[10:24] authentication so and
[10:28] as i mentioned that p progress max 3 is
[10:31] really helpful during the research
[10:32] as you can see the picture right here i
[10:36] we are able to use in first mark 3 to
[10:38] talk to the
[10:39] to send different commands a btu command
[10:43] to
[10:44] to your target to the tag and we can
[10:46] able to get
[10:47] some information out for example public
[10:50] key
[10:51] or different java updates ai like
[10:54] sending different aid to require
[10:56] different java uploads to do some tests
[10:58] so yeah
[11:00] and right
[11:04] so now i think it's time for some real
[11:06] hacks right
[11:07] cool um so
[11:10] since our goal here is actually to get
[11:13] nfc relay working
[11:14] and there are many research has done
[11:16] great jobs in this area already so
[11:19] in beginning we don't want to reinvent
[11:22] the wheels
[11:23] so we just do some research and find
[11:26] there's a very cool application
[11:30] called the nfc gate and msk
[11:33] is basically it's an android application
[11:35] it's meant for
[11:36] capture analyzing or even modified enemy
[11:39] traffic on file
[11:40] so basically it's pretty cool it's
[11:42] perfect for for us
[11:44] right and he operates basically we need
[11:47] two
[11:48] mobile phones at running the ck
[11:51] and we need to set our wi-fi server in
[11:54] the middle
[11:55] right so can true uh to send to relay
[11:58] through
[11:59] the traffic um
[12:04] so yeah so for the first for test run
[12:07] um we will trying to target our credit
[12:10] card system
[12:11] to see if we can buy a coffee for free
[12:14] right
[12:14] so with someone's uh what was my car
[12:17] this car
[12:18] basically so and so here's the result i
[12:21] would like to show you
[12:24] right so basically we try to uh was one
[12:28] of
[12:28] carly to pretend to be a bad guy and me
[12:31] just uh try to reach out to
[12:35] someone else card right um
[12:46] yeah as you can see the traffic is
[12:47] already go through
[12:52] we successfully buy to get coffee
[12:56] for free and by this point
[13:00] we are very yeah yeah by this point
[13:03] we are very happy so we'll run to remote
[13:06] want to look
[13:07] a parking lot for hours uh to test it
[13:10] model 3.
[13:12] um unfortunately
[13:15] it failed for the first attempt right as
[13:18] i mentioned
[13:19] usually it will fail for the first time
[13:22] but let's find out
[13:25] why we have what happened exactly right
[13:29] okay so
[13:32] and again we brought out our personal
[13:35] tree
[13:36] and start to capture and come and
[13:38] compare the nf traffic
[13:40] between the actual tesla key attack and
[13:43] the other
[13:44] which you relate by the nfc gate to to
[13:47] to do some
[13:48] to see if there's anything i'm we were
[13:50] missed
[13:53] and yeah so here
[13:57] are the traffic data we
[14:00] captured by pm3 proposed mark iii
[14:04] and also here all the traffic we
[14:06] captured by nsk itself it has a login
[14:08] file
[14:09] uh function so as you can see one of the
[14:12] response
[14:12] by the the tag is it can convert
[14:16] back to uh convert to the hack string
[14:19] to something we can read as a tester
[14:22] logic which indicate that this is
[14:24] this it is a um
[14:27] tesla's analysis key tag okay
[14:32] so let's walk through some uh
[14:36] those text strings try to understand
[14:39] what's going on here
[14:40] so first um yeah so this is
[14:43] important here right so first the
[14:49] uh the reader
[14:53] the the sorry
[14:56] the reader will send out uh a request
[14:59] asking for testological aid for uh
[15:03] like tbk which stands for tesla
[15:07] phone key um but because we are actually
[15:10] using the nfc key tag
[15:13] the our reader our attack will respond
[15:15] with 66 d
[15:17] 0 0 which means instruction invalid
[15:19] which is which
[15:21] means the this particular id doesn't
[15:24] exist
[15:25] so and then the test i will send another
[15:27] request
[15:28] will send another request asking for tkc
[15:32] which is tesla key card and and yes
[15:36] executed successfully by um like
[15:39] zero zero and because we we are using
[15:42] uh tesla keycard so yeah it does exist
[15:46] so then the the reader will send you
[15:49] select
[15:50] this particular aid okay now like
[15:53] this is a tesla logic update listed
[15:56] right
[15:57] and then the reader will send out
[15:58] authentication command
[16:00] for this particular uh aid and like
[16:03] they they send out a vehicle public key
[16:06] and followed by a 16 byte challenge
[16:09] now for the attack itself we have to
[16:12] respond
[16:13] with a 16 byte response
[16:17] and once we have log sort out then
[16:20] we are uh authenticated to to the reader
[16:24] and then
[16:24] we can do some action like open the open
[16:27] a door or
[16:28] closed door and stuff something like
[16:30] that right so
[16:33] as you can see the whole authentication
[16:36] process
[16:37] kind of simple but why we annually
[16:40] really attack on credit card
[16:41] system it works the model 3 is not
[16:45] and turns out the reason is the payment
[16:48] terminal
[16:49] the por post system is
[16:52] it's not required to stop transaction if
[16:54] it takes longer time
[16:56] but the tesla in the other hand has more
[16:59] restriction on timing
[17:00] it has to be very it has to be respond
[17:04] in a very specific time
[17:06] otherwise it will be time out if we say
[17:09] if we didn't respond the correct answer
[17:11] on id on time
[17:12] and then it failed right so because we
[17:15] are related
[17:16] remember we are related traffic through
[17:18] wi-fi network
[17:19] and there's a lot a lot of
[17:22] things can happen during this
[17:24] transaction so
[17:27] now our job is to increase
[17:31] our speed and luckily there's a great
[17:34] research according to
[17:36] he is kind enough to give us some advice
[17:39] advice um but unfortunately this
[17:42] identifies second
[17:43] which is second attempt also failed but
[17:46] thanks for him
[17:47] um let's try harder
[17:50] right basically and then
[17:54] my uh colleague alex
[17:58] he came up with some idea to verify
[18:00] because we
[18:01] allow at that point we're not really
[18:02] sure if it is a timing
[18:04] issue only or maybe something else
[18:06] sparked the way
[18:07] so his ideas is uh instead
[18:10] really trapped by wi-fi maybe we're
[18:13] using the
[18:14] usb cables because the auto traffic
[18:17] then you transfer
[18:21] locally so it's supposed to be very very
[18:24] fast
[18:24] right let's see if that works
[18:28] so so here's our first video um
[18:32] you can also check out uh youtube on
[18:35] this
[18:36] for later right
[18:39] yeah cool as you can see we actually uh
[18:42] relay by the
[18:44] usb it works so it is
[18:47] timing it is less we have to find a way
[18:50] to
[18:51] increase the speed but how
[18:58] um and then
[19:02] yes we we found another trick from the
[19:04] same
[19:06] same same guy silverado which is
[19:08] inspiring us very
[19:10] a lot because basically he has
[19:13] given a talk um like at defcon 26
[19:17] basically he able to bypass
[19:21] the payment limit by simply replace
[19:25] certain value during the transaction and
[19:27] also he can able to
[19:29] replay also same again centric
[19:32] replace different values in order to
[19:36] instead using emv for for the um they
[19:40] actually turn
[19:40] to using microstrike for for payment
[19:43] systems
[19:44] so let's get our thinking can we do the
[19:47] same
[19:50] um so let's go back to the general
[19:53] traffic
[19:54] traffics we captured by uh pros max 3
[19:58] right so
[20:01] basically remember we we mentioned that
[20:04] um the the first the
[20:08] reader will send out uh they asking for
[20:11] a particular java update aid which not
[20:14] never exists
[20:15] like they actually start f4 and then
[20:19] because it doesn't exist they will be
[20:22] filed right so they
[20:23] send another request asking for another
[20:26] uh java update
[20:27] called star wars 74. so
[20:31] um can we do something about here
[20:36] and definitely yes so let's sorry i
[20:40] dropped
[20:40] draw a very ugly uh picture here but
[20:44] let me try to explain what happened so
[20:47] basically
[20:48] first tesla model 3 will send out the
[20:50] reader will send out
[20:51] the like request looking for a
[20:55] java update f4 right but because it
[20:57] doesn't exist
[20:59] um it will it will the attack will reply
[21:03] response with a 60 60 000 so
[21:07] it's not it doesn't exist okay and
[21:12] so but instead we
[21:16] redirect the 60 000 we we send
[21:20] um we
[21:23] actually four 14 and instead
[21:27] looking for f4 we folding that
[21:30] asking for 74 because we know that 74
[21:33] a java update does exist and
[21:37] because uh and then obviously tag will
[21:40] receive this
[21:41] uh request will say okay you are you're
[21:43] asking for
[21:44] 74 then we it does exist and then we
[21:47] just respond with 90 000
[21:49] and you will and then we're using
[21:51] another uh um
[21:53] skate nfc gate to
[21:56] uh send those uh response back
[22:00] because and that takes some time here so
[22:03] by the time you're there uh
[22:06] processing this command the testimony
[22:10] will send another request
[22:12] looking for the actual request sending
[22:14] they're looking for 74
[22:15] another the one actual the real one sent
[22:18] by
[22:19] by the models read module um but we
[22:22] by we because we are men in the middle
[22:25] so we
[22:26] drop it right we don't need a second
[22:29] uh 74. so now by
[22:32] by the time we finish with we've done
[22:34] this
[22:35] the the knight h0 has already arrived so
[22:40] by this thing so we can just fall into
[22:43] to the test model three
[22:44] and one test model street now seems
[22:47] interesting here now
[22:48] but once they we we bypass those
[22:52] um
[22:55] aid selection we go
[22:58] to a challenge response stage at this
[23:01] stage
[23:03] it it seems it seems like during the
[23:06] test
[23:06] it seems like we don't have any time
[23:08] limits anymore we can send
[23:10] and wait as long as we want
[23:13] right so um so yeah um
[23:16] basically we just dropped one uh instead
[23:18] instead looking for two
[23:20] different aids like f4 and 74. we just
[23:23] drop
[23:24] one of them and send in looking for 74
[23:27] directly we will simply by doing this
[23:31] which successfully by parsley
[23:33] uh the
[23:36] the times the the time limit right
[23:39] so and here's
[23:42] we just play this uh we do that demo to
[23:45] to show the whole process
[23:48] okay
[23:56] as you can see
[24:00] because is a traffic relayed by wi-fi
[24:04] is you can experience sound a little bit
[24:06] slow but it still works right
[24:07] as you can see it will open
[24:15] and you can check out the the current
[24:18] font
[24:19] the firmware
[24:22] right
[24:27] and and then wait drop
[24:31] and driving away
[24:35] okay cool now
[24:39] because we want to see how practical
[24:43] this nfc relay attack this so we we're
[24:46] testing
[24:47] with a lot we want to see the log if
[24:49] that works
[24:50] in long distance right so here's another
[24:52] video i want to show
[24:54] demo i want to show you is we are
[24:57] actually testing
[24:58] in kind of far away um
[25:02] let's see the results
[25:05] right so as you can see my card is
[25:09] kind of far away in the parking lot yeah
[25:12] still works
[25:14] right cool beautiful
[25:19] so by this stage we're very happy and
[25:22] report our funding to to tesla
[25:26] and however
[25:30] tesla replied our email and say that
[25:33] they really attack unknown limitation
[25:36] for
[25:37] for their systems and
[25:40] i really recommend really recommend
[25:42] customers who are concerned about relay
[25:44] attack
[25:45] enable pin to drive so basically there's
[25:48] no bounty
[25:49] and they know the vulnerable
[25:52] availability exists
[25:54] but they don't they don't think it's uh
[25:57] very important because they think there
[25:59] they already have some
[26:00] thing called a pin to drive already so
[26:03] here's a world resolver uh so first
[26:10] basically even so basically what we need
[26:14] to i need to address here is pin to
[26:17] drive
[26:17] is actually not protecting from the
[26:20] relay attack
[26:21] it's only protecting you once you open
[26:23] it with a
[26:24] open door you cannot stop engine you
[26:27] have to
[26:28] enter in something right but we are
[26:31] still
[26:32] able to open the door and so basically
[26:36] the risk still there
[26:37] right so once we're getting oh bad guy
[26:39] getting they can't they
[26:41] yes they they may not able to choose
[26:43] steel vehicle but they still can
[26:46] steal some some stuff inside your car
[26:49] or even worse they can put something in
[26:51] like spec camera or something
[26:55] and yeah so i i think the pin drive
[26:58] is really uh debatable solution for
[27:01] phone from tesla
[27:02] but anyway um we we apply a cve
[27:06] and we get a cv here and we're happy
[27:09] enough right
[27:10] so but what is spin drive anyway
[27:14] um so basically i i
[27:18] i found this pin drive description from
[27:21] tesla website the most interesting most
[27:24] interesting part here is
[27:26] that pin to drive allow you to set a
[27:29] secure
[27:30] four digit modification right four
[27:33] digits
[27:35] so like what could possibly go wrong
[27:38] right only four digit numbers now we
[27:41] also
[27:42] during the research we found there's no
[27:44] ping position randomization
[27:46] so it's always stand fixed um
[27:50] in the middle now late
[27:53] at least up the useless research has
[27:57] done for for for some time now and at a
[28:00] time we're testing
[28:01] on different uh fungal version
[28:05] we tend and at least a lot moments
[28:09] uh there's no proof force rate
[28:12] limitation
[28:13] and no proof force back off time so
[28:16] but maybe layer free fix now but a lot
[28:19] of time
[28:20] it doesn't have anything so footage
[28:23] numbers
[28:24] no proof was protections yeah
[28:28] you got idea so
[28:32] oops so um
[28:38] so we we actually built a hardware
[28:42] based on the thing called m5 stack
[28:46] i i named it pinto crack right
[28:49] so basically we can use the nuts
[28:52] to the of course we can do
[28:56] with the maybe we can do it with the
[28:58] rosary pie or
[28:59] arduino it doesn't have to be m5 stack
[29:01] basically the idea is just
[29:03] just like um instead we put
[29:06] push the pin number itself we can do it
[29:08] automatically
[29:09] right so now but let's catch
[29:13] up oh by the way there's another uh guy
[29:15] doing a similar
[29:16] um attack on on his tesla
[29:20] as well so but uh i think um
[29:24] this is our solution so similar same
[29:26] idea
[29:27] however the catch is um we have to
[29:31] finish
[29:31] the whole setup process and the two
[29:34] minutes
[29:35] otherwise we have to relay the tesla key
[29:38] tag again
[29:39] now by just what we found it by just
[29:42] setting up those p
[29:43] because we have to focus on the exact
[29:45] position to underpin
[29:47] on the screen um but i just set up
[29:50] everything set up already it's already
[29:52] taken a lot of times
[29:54] so with maybe instead
[29:58] using the machine uh device which you
[30:00] think are using our first fingers
[30:02] right so here we're gonna just show you
[30:07] uh the first thing finger
[30:09] will works so first we
[30:13] are able to uh open your
[30:16] the door open the door or get in because
[30:18] there's a pin
[30:19] to drive function already we have to uh
[30:22] enter the pin
[30:24] right so as you can see the firmware
[30:26] version
[30:27] verify the function right um yeah the
[30:30] pin drive so
[30:31] as you can see in the beginning we
[30:33] pretend we don't we don't know anything
[30:35] about a pin
[30:35] so we just randomly or first
[30:40] try to try our luck now the point here
[30:42] is really is
[30:44] we can see there is no rufus protection
[30:47] we can just rent run
[30:50] maybe not random we open we're just
[30:54] entering
[30:54] keep entering uh different pin a piece
[30:57] even digit
[30:58] try try to see if we get a lock so say
[31:02] let me let me speed up a little bit and
[31:08] okay okay see there's no no nothing stop
[31:12] us to keep
[31:12] entering the pin
[31:16] uh right you see the oh
[31:20] huh see
[31:24] let me see where
[31:34] ah actually i don't know where where's
[31:36] the actual key
[31:37] phenomena so i don't know where to stop
[31:39] oh see here we got it
[31:41] right so i see as you can see wait
[31:43] during this long like
[31:45] this is the only demonstration the
[31:47] actual attack may take longer but yeah
[31:49] the point is really they don't have any
[31:51] sympathetic in it right
[31:52] so we can just using our frost finger
[31:54] maybe you can get them
[31:56] yeah so good to go
[32:01] okay
[32:04] right um so
[32:07] the the summary here so like really
[32:11] the security by obscurity is not going
[32:14] to work
[32:14] right so and the
[32:18] hundreds percent security does not exist
[32:20] we have to test
[32:22] properly we need to to uh even like you
[32:25] know vehicles you you may think like
[32:26] those high-end
[32:28] cars are very secure but once they layer
[32:32] implement some like
[32:35] latest technology then it actually opens
[32:39] more attack vectors
[32:40] for the attackers so we need to rethink
[32:42] this uh
[32:43] carefully okay um
[32:48] yeah so here are some reference that if
[32:51] you
[32:51] you guys are interested to continue
[32:53] research i definitely recommend you can
[32:56] try
[32:56] those um skate i just mentioned and you
[32:59] go to
[32:59] uh all those guys uh very good in in
[33:02] this
[33:03] in this area and yeah so
[33:08] uh go check them out all right okay
[33:11] thank you
[33:12] i'm done
