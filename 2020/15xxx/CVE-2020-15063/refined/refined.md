The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in USB network server firmwares. Specifically, it details an authentication bypass vulnerability in the web administration interface, which is associated with CVE-2020-15063.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the web interface not properly enforcing password authentication. When the password parameter is omitted from a request, the server interprets this as no password being set, allowing access to privileged functions without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The web interface fails to properly validate the presence of the password parameter, leading to an authentication bypass.
*   **Insecure design:** The software does not fail the request when no password parameter is provided. Instead it assumes that no password is set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can access and modify settings on the web administration interface, including functions that should be restricted to administrators.
*   **Complete control:** With access to the administrative functions an attacker can completely control the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** Attackers can craft HTTP POST requests to the web interface, omitting the password parameter, to gain access to privileged functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send modified HTTP POST requests to the web server.
