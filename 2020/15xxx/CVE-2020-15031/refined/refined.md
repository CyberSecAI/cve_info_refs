Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the NeDi 1.9C application. Specifically, user-supplied input via URL parameters is not being sanitized before being used in the application's web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application takes user input from the URL and directly displays it on the page without proper encoding or sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable web pages.
*   This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or displaying fake login forms.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Executing malicious code on the user's browser.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data visible to the user.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In specific scenarios, XSS can lead to privilege escalation if the application doesn't implement proper authorization mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs.
*   An attacker would need to entice a user to click on a specially crafted URL containing the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
*   The attacker needs to find a way to deliver the crafted URL to a victim. This can be done through various means such as phishing emails, malicious websites, or forum posts.
*   No specific attacker capabilities within the target network are required, besides having access to the application and network.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the targeted user needs to be logged into the application for the XSS to be triggered.

**Specific Details for CVE-2020-15031:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the "Assets-Management.php" page.
*   The vulnerable parameter is "chg".
*   An example URL to trigger the vulnerability is provided: `https://ip/Assets-Management.php?chg=<img src=a onerror=alert(document.domain)>`

**Additional Notes:**
