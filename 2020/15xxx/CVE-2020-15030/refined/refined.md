Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-15030:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the NeDi 1.9C application, specifically within the "Topology-Routes.php" page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, where malicious scripts are injected through URL parameters and executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `rtr` parameter of the `Topology-Routes.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `rtr` parameter and trick a user of the application into visiting this URL. This could be achieved through social engineering (e.g., sending the link via email) or by injecting the link into another website.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The XSS will trigger even if the targeted user is not logged into NeDi.
*   The victim needs to be logged in to the NeDi application for the exploit to work.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable URL is `https://ip/Topology-Routes.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `rtr`.
*   An example payload is: `https://ip/Topology-Routes.php?rtr=<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that multiple XSS vulnerabilities were found in NeDi 1.9C, with CVE-2020-15030 specifically assigned to the vulnerability in `Topology-Routes.php` using the `rtr` parameter.
