VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15782

Affected devices are vulnerable to a memory protection bypass through a speciﬁc operation.

A remote unauthenticated attacker with network access to port 102/tcp could potentially write arbitrary
data and code to protected memory areas or read sensitive data to launch further attacks.

V1.1

SUMMARY

Several models of SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives are affected by a memory protection
bypass vulnerability in the integrated S7-1500 or S7-1200 CPU that could allow an attacker to write
arbitrary data and code to protected memory areas or read sensitive data to launch further attacks on the
CPU.

Siemens provides new drives with the ﬁx included and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for older
drives. The list of affected drive models can be found in the section “Additional Information”.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180
Drives:
Drives manufactured before 2021-08-13

Drives manufactured on 2021-08-13 or later are
not affected, as they contain a corrected version
of the S7-1500 or S7-1200 CPU.

For drives manufactured before 2021-08-13, see
the recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid compromise of the individually conﬁgured access protection password to the S7-1500 or

S7-1200 CPU

• Ensure that the drive internal network is not externally connected (which is the default conﬁguration

in all drives as described in the operational manual)

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply password protection for S7 communication

SSA-434534

© Siemens 2021

Page 1 of 3

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• Disallow client connections via the ENDIS_PW instruction of the S7-1200 or S7-1500 CPU (This

blocks remote client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password)

• Use the display to conﬁgure additional access protection of the S7-1500 CPU (This blocks remote

client connections, even when the client can provide the correct password)

• Apply “defense in depth” as outlined on pages 12ff of the operational guidelines for Industrial

Security, especially:

– Plant security: Physical prevention of access to critical components
– Network security: Ensure that PLC systems are not connected to untrusted networks

* System integrity: Conﬁgure, maintain and protect your device by applying applicable compensating
controls and using built-in security capabilities

• Update your entire solution to TIA Portal V17 and use TLS communication using individual certiﬁ-

cates between PLC, HMIs and PG/PC

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
