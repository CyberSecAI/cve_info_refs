Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication for the WebSocket protocol in the DevSpace UI server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Authentication: The primary weakness is the absence of proper authentication mechanisms for WebSocket connections to the DevSpace UI server. This allows unauthenticated access to the WebSocket interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution:  An attacker can leverage the lack of authentication to execute arbitrary code on pods managed by DevSpace. This is achieved by sending malicious commands through the vulnerable WebSocket connection, leading to a critical security impact.
- Arbitrary Actions on Pods: The attacker can perform actions on pods on behalf of a victim, meaning they can manipulate or compromise the containers managed by DevSpace.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based Attack: The attack is network-based, meaning the attacker can be remote (logically and physically).
- WebSocket Protocol:  The vulnerability is specifically exploited through the WebSocket protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No Privileges Required:  The attacker does not need any prior privileges on the DevSpace system or the Kubernetes cluster.
- No User Interaction: The attack can be performed without requiring any interaction from the victim user.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable DevSpace UI server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects DevSpace versions 4.13.0 and earlier.
- The fix was introduced in version 4.14.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Barak Tawily and Amit De-Paz.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a Critical severity issue with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8.
- The related CWEs are CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).
