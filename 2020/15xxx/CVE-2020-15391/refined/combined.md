## Description

![@abh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16861?v=4&size=48)[abh](https://github.com/abh)opened [on Jul 3, 2020](https://github.com/devspace-sh/devspace/issues/1126#issue-650409975)

When using loft there's a no default resource limits configured, so kaniko fails with an error that resource limits aren't specified. If devspace set (or had options to configure) limits on kaniko this would work.

I would like to make a responsible disclosure for a security issue with a critical impact on a specific service on Devspace.

I don't want to expose a technical details so potential malicious might exploit it.

I would like to get an email or link so I would be able to explain without exposing it to non-contributors

Thanks.

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-6h8c-gw33-cjm2/dependabot)

## Package

gomod

([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 4.13.0

## Patched versions

4.14.0

## Description

The UI in DevSpace 4.13.0 allows web sites to execute actions on pods (on behalf of a victim) because of a lack of authentication for the WebSocket protocol. This leads to remote code execution.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
