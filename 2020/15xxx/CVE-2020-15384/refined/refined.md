- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the inclusion of internal server information within the initial login response header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The login response header is exposing internal server information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to potentially sensitive internal server information. The specific type of information exposed is not detailed, but the CVSS score indicates a low impact to confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a login request to the server which reveals information in the initial login response header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to send a login request. No special privileges are required (PR:N), and the attack can be done remotely (AV:N).
