Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15669:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition that occurs when an `AbortSignal` is deleted while its followers are being notified of the abort. Specifically, the `AbortSignalImpl` object, which manages the list of followers, can be deallocated during the iteration process when a follower removes the signal itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The code attempts to access the `nsTArray` containing the followers after the memory associated with it has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The bug report suggests that this use-after-free could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution with sufficient effort. This is a high-severity vulnerability due to the potential for complete system compromise.
- **Crash:** A crash can be triggered reliably as demonstrated by the ASan report.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Content:** The vulnerability is triggered through web content, specifically by using the Fetch API and AbortController/AbortSignal to initiate and then cancel operations.
- **JavaScript API:** The vulnerability can be triggered by using the JavaScript Abort API to abort fetch requests with attached AbortSignals

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Page Execution:** An attacker needs to be able to execute malicious JavaScript within the context of a vulnerable browser. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious webpage.
- **Exploitation of Abort Signal:**  An attacker would need to trigger the use-after-free by causing an abort signal to be deleted during the iteration process. This involves carefully crafting the timing and interaction of abort signals and their followers. The provided test case, `testcase.html` (attachment ID 9167723), demonstrates how to achieve this scenario.

**Additional Details:**
- **Pref Requirement:** The `dom.fetchObserver.enabled` preference must be enabled to reproduce the vulnerability.
- **Testcase:** A sample HTML testcase was provided with the bug report, further confirming the ease of exploitation.
- **Fix:** The fix for this issue involves pinning the `AbortSignalImpl` instance with a `RefPtr` during the iteration within `AbortSignalImpl::Abort`, preventing the object from being deallocated while its followers are being notified.
- **Versions Affected:**  This vulnerability affected multiple versions of Firefox, including ESR68, ESR78, Firefox 80, and Firefox 81.
