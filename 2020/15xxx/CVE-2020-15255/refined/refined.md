Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when exporting data to CSV files. Specifically, the application does not prevent the inclusion of characters that are interpreted as formula prefixes by spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection (aka Formula Injection):** The primary weakness is the application's failure to sanitize user-controlled data before exporting it to a CSV file. When a cell value begins with characters like `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`, spreadsheet software interprets the content as a formula, allowing for malicious code execution or data exfiltration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** By crafting malicious formulas in user-provided fields (User, Project, and Note), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when the CSV file is opened with a vulnerable spreadsheet program. This can lead to full system compromise.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious formulas can also be used to extract data from the opened spreadsheet or other open spreadsheets.
*   **System Hijacking:** As a result of arbitrary code execution, attackers can hijack the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Controlled Data:** The vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied data entered in the "User," "Project," and "Note" fields.
*   **CSV Export:** The attack is realized when the user generates a CSV report containing the maliciously crafted input.
*   **Spreadsheet Software:** The vulnerability relies on the spreadsheet software's interpretation of formulas within CSV files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Anuko Time Tracker application.
*   **Ability to Input Data:** The attacker needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields (User, Project, Note).
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to download and open the generated CSV file in a vulnerable spreadsheet application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit code provided shows that the malicious payload `*=rundll32|'URL.dll,OpenURL calc.exe'!A*` is injected into the user, project, and note fields.
*   The fix involves neutralizing user input by removing `=`, `+`, `-`, and `@` characters from the beginning of cell values. Double quote characters are also escaped. This is implemented in the `ttNeutralizeForCsv` function.
*   The vulnerable versions are <= 1.19.23.5324, and the patched version is 1.19.23.5325.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is also known as CSV or Excel macro injection.
*   The OWASP documentation on CSV injection provides further information on the attack and mitigation.
