{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The express-jwt library, in versions before 6.0.0, does not enforce the 'algorithms' configuration entry. When 'algorithms' is not specified, and the 'secret' is obtained from libraries like jwks-rsa, it can lead to an authorization bypass.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The library does not enforce the 'algorithms' configuration, leading to potential use of unexpected algorithms.",
       "Lack of input validation/enforcement"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms if the server relies on express-jwt for verifying JWT tokens.  This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a JWT token with a different algorithm than the server expects.  If the server does not have `algorithms` configured to restrict allowed algorithms, the server may process the token even if it has not been signed with a legitimate secret.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a JWT token, choose a signing algorithm, and send it to the server with express-jwt in place."
