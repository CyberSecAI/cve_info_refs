The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15813.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Graylog LDAP connector does not properly verify TLS certificates presented by the LDAP server. Specifically, it accepts certificates even if the root certificate is not present in the trust store.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper TLS certificate verification during LDAP connections.
- Accepting certificates that are not chained to a trusted root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks become possible. An attacker can intercept and potentially manipulate communications between Graylog and the LDAP server.
- Exposure of sensitive information like usernames and passwords transmitted over the insecure channel.
- Possibility of unauthorized access by the attacker modifying responses from LDAP server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based MITM attack.
- Interception of communication between Graylog server and LDAP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Graylog server and the LDAP server.
- Ability to present a malicious certificate to the Graylog server during the TLS handshake.
- The attacker needs to be on the network path between Graylog and LDAP servers to perform MITM attack.
