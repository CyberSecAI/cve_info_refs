## Details

USN-4451-1 fixed a vulnerability in ppp. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

Thomas Chauchefoin working with Trend Micro´s Zero Day Initiative,

discovered that ppp incorrectly handled module loading. A local attacker

could use this issue to load arbitrary kernel modules and possibly execute

arbitrary code.
