Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15704:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `ppp` (Point-to-Point Protocol) package incorrectly handling module loading. Specifically, the `load_ppp_generic_if_needed` patch, which was intended to load a kernel module, was removed in later versions, as the functionality was built into the kernel. However, the logic to handle module loading remained, and could be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect handling of module loading in the `ppp` package.
- The `ppp` package can be manipulated to load arbitrary kernel modules by a local attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker can load arbitrary kernel modules.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges, potentially taking over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system running a vulnerable version of the `ppp` package.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges initially, but can achieve elevated privileges by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Thomas Chauchefoin, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- The fix for this issue involved removing the problematic logic and ensuring the module loading was properly managed by the kernel directly.
- Ubuntu Security Notices USN-4451-1 and USN-4451-2 address this vulnerability in various Ubuntu releases.
