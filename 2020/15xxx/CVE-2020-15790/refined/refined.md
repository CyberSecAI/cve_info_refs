- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server, if not securely configured, may expose directory contents through directory listing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of information through directory listing (CWE-548).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially retrieve the contents of a directory, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) and does not require user interaction (UI:N). The attack requires high effort due to the insecure configuration being a prerequisite (AC:H).
