Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15668:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A data race exists in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. Specifically, the `NSC_GetTokenInfo` function does not lock `slot->slotLock` before accessing `slot` after obtaining it, even though `slotLock` is defined as its lock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Data Race:** Concurrent access to the `slot` data structure without proper locking can lead to undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided information doesn't explicitly state the impact of this data race, but the bug report suggests it can lead to crashes and correctness issues. It is rated as "sec-low", indicating that while it is a security issue, its impact is likely not critical.
-The specific impact is not detailed beyond "crashes as well as correctness issues". The lack of proper locking in a hot path for TLS connection could have other undefined consequences.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the process of importing certificate information into the trust database.
- This occurs during normal web browsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be in a privileged position.
- The vulnerability is triggered during normal web browsing.

**Additional details:**

- The bug was found by ThreadSanitizer during normal web browsing on mozilla-central.
- The fix involves adding the missing lock to `NSC_GetTokenInfo`.
- The bug was fixed in Firefox 80, but was marked as "wontfix" for older ESR branches like Firefox ESR 68 and 78
