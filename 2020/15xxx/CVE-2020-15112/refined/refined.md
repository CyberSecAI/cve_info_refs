Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `ReadAll` method in the `wal/wal.go` file of the etcd project. The method doesn't properly validate entry indices. It's possible for an entry index to be greater than the actual number of entries present in the WAL (Write-Ahead Log).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Data Validation Failure:** The core issue is a lack of proper validation of entry indices during the reading of WAL entries. This allows for out-of-bounds access during reading.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** When an invalid entry index is encountered, it can lead to a runtime panic (crash) in the etcd process, causing a denial of service. This is particularly problematic in a consensus environment where an arbitrary participant crashing due to this issue can affect the cluster's ability to function.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious WAL Data:** An attacker could craft or manipulate the WAL data in such a way that it contains an invalid index. This could be done by either directly writing to the WAL or through some other etcd operation that ends up writing to the WAL in an unexpected way.
-   **Consensus Disruption:** An attacker does not have to corrupt the WAL directly. Any consensus participant reading the WAL could go down with a panic when reading the corrupted WAL data. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Write Access to WAL:** An attacker would need the ability to influence the WAL data, either by directly modifying it or through the etcd API in a way that creates entries with invalid indices.
-   **Etcd Cluster Membership (potentially):** The attacker might not need to be a member of the cluster. Any etcd instance that reads the corrupted WAL data would crash. This could be a node trying to join the cluster, or a node participating in the consensus.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is described as "Moderate" severity.
- Patches were released in etcd versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23.
- This issue is related to a security audit report available [here](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)
