Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `EditPage.class.php` in the Soy Inquiry plugin of SOY CMS does not properly validate CSRF tokens or check the referrer when processing file edit requests. This allows an attacker to make unauthorized changes to files on the server. Additionally, the application is vulnerable to directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application lacks CSRF protection on the file edit functionality.
*  **Directory Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize the 'target' parameter, allowing attackers to potentially access and modify files outside the intended directory.
*   **Unrestricted File Modification:** The application directly writes the content of a POST request to a file without proper validation or sanitization, making it possible to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the CSRF and unrestricted file modification vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject malicious code into a template file. When this file is accessed by the server, the code will be executed, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious webpage that triggers a POST request to the `EditPage.class.php` with a crafted `target` parameter and `content` field.
*   The administrator of the SOY CMS needs to be logged in and visit the malicious webpage, which will then perform the malicious file modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the CMS, but requires that an authenticated administrator visits their page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in SOY CMS version 3.0.2 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was found by stypr from Flatt Security Inc.
*   A fix was implemented in pull request #15, which added a CSRF token and referrer check.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-15182.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `cms/app/webapp/inquiry/pages/Template/EditPage.class.php`.
