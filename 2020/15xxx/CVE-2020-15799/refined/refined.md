- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The webserver of the affected devices lacks authentication for critical functions. An unauthenticated attacker could reboot the device over the network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can reboot the device via the integrated web server by using special URLs. This leads to denial-of-service and system impact.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, by sending specially crafted requests to the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the device's web server. No authentication is required.
