Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The CSRF prevention token is stored in a request cookie that lacks the `HttpOnly` annotation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing HttpOnly Flag:** The absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on the cookie storing the CSRF token allows client-side scripts (JavaScript) to access and manipulate it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can overwrite the CSRF token in the victim's browser, allowing them to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. This means an attacker can potentially execute actions on behalf of the victim without their knowledge or consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** The primary attack vector relies on the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary code (e.g. through malicious JavaScript) within a user's browser session. This could be achieved through various methods, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or other browser-based exploits.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject and Execute Arbitrary Code:** The attacker needs to inject and execute malicious code within the victim's browser session. This code must be able to access and manipulate the cookies set for the vulnerable application.
- **Target User Must be Logged in:** The user must have an active session with the vulnerable application for the CSRF attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Gradle Enterprise versions 2018.2 to 2020.2.4.
- The fix involves upgrading to Gradle Enterprise 2020.2.5 or later.
- The vulnerability was reported by Compass Security.
