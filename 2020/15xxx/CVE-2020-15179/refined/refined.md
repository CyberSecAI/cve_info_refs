{
  "CVE-2020-15179": {
    "Description": "ScratchSig extension for MediaWiki allows stored Cross-Site Scripting. Using <script> tag inside tag, attackers with edit permission can execute scripts on visitors' browser. With MediaWiki JavaScript API, this can potentially lead to privilege escalation and/or account takeover.",
    "Root cause": "The ScratchSig extension for MediaWiki did not properly sanitize user input within the `<scratchsig>` tag, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML, including `<script>` tags.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with edit permissions can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of visitors viewing the page, leading to privilege escalation or account takeover through the MediaWiki JavaScript API.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with edit permission can inject a `<script>` tag inside a `<scratchsig>` tag, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the page containing the tag.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have edit permission on the MediaWiki site.",
    "Patches": "The vulnerability was patched in release 1.0.1 of the mw-scratchsig2 extension."
