# Stored Cross-site Scripting

Critical

[jacob-g](/jacob-g)
published
GHSA-gp9v-pg9f-vmp6
Sep 15, 2020

## Package

mw-scratchsig2

## Affected versions

1.0

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

ScratchSig extension for MediaWiki allows stored Cross-Site Scripting. Using <script> tag inside tag, attackers with edit permission can execute scripts on visitors' browser. With MediaWiki JavaScript API, this can potentially lead to privilege escalation and/or account takeover.

### Patches

This has been patched in release 1.0.1. This has already been deployed to all Scratch Wikis.

### Workarounds

No workarounds exist other than disabling the extension completely.

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15179

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
