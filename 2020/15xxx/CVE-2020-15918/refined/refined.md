**Verification:**
The content explicitly mentions CVE-2020-15918 as one of the vulnerabilities found in Mida Solutions eFramework.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an undisclosed component of Mida Solutions eFramework.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Stored XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript can be stored in the application's database, and later executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to session hijacking. An attacker could steal a user's session cookies, enabling them to impersonate that user and access sensitive information or perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of the eFramework. The attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code into a field or parameter that is stored by the application. When a user views the stored data containing the injected code, the script is executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (have a valid user account) within the eFramework application to inject the malicious script.
- The attacker needs the ability to inject data into a field that is not properly sanitized.
