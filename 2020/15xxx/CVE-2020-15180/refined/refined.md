  "CVE-2020-15180": {
    "description": "The mysql-wsrep component of Galera Cluster is vulnerable to command injection in the `wsrep_sst_method` field due to insufficient input sanitization. The contents of `wsrep_sst_method` are passed to pthread_create() as arguments, allowing remote command injection across Galera Cluster nodes when a new node joins the cluster.",
    "affected_components": [
      "mysql-wsrep component of Galera Cluster",
        "Percona XtraDB Cluster",
      "MariaDB"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization in the `wsrep_sst_method` field.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on galera cluster nodes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to WSREP service port (4567/TCP)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Malicious party requires access to the WSREP service port (4567/TCP) and knowledge of the Galera cluster name.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs during State Snapshot Transfer (SST), when a new node joins the cluster. The `wsrep_sst_method` field specifies the SST method and is passed to pthread_create() as arguments, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands. Patches introduce routines to validate `wsrep_sst_method` input.",
        "affected_versions": [
          "MariaDB versions before 10.1.47, 10.2.34, 10.3.25, 10.4.15, and 10.5.6",

    "remediation": "Upgrade to patched versions of MariaDB or Percona XtraDB Cluster. Patched versions of Percona XtraDB Cluster include >= 8.0.20-11.2, >= 5.7.31-31.45.2 and >= 5.6.49-28.42.2"
