{
  "CVE-2020-15931": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner service automatically attempts to authenticate to the host that caused the bad authentication over the SMB service without verifying if the host is domain-joined or not. This behavior allows an attacker to capture the NTLMv1/v2 challenge-response of the service account by generating a Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failed event (Event ID 4771) on a domain controller, forcing the vulnerable software to authenticate to the attacker's controlled system.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Unvalidated authentication to arbitrary hosts",
        "NTLMv1/v2 credential disclosure"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain the NTLMv1/v2 hash of the Netwrix service account which typically has Domain Admin privileges. This can lead to the following:",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack is triggered remotely by generating a Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failed (Event ID 4771) event on a domain controller. The vulnerable software then attempts to connect to the attacking host over SMB, disclosing the NTLM challenge-response.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Attacker needs to be on the same routable network with the domain controller(s) and the server running the Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner application.",
         "Needs at least one (1) valid username (no password needed).",
         "Needs the IP address of the target domain controller, and a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)."
