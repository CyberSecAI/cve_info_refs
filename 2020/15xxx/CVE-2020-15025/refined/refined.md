  "CVE-2020-15025": {
    "description": "ntpd in ntp 4.2.8 before 4.2.8p15 and 4.3.x before 4.3.101 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending packets, because memory is not freed in situations where a CMAC key is used and associated with a CMAC algorithm in the ntp.keys file.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "ntp 4.2.8 before 4.2.8p15",
      "ntp 4.3.x before 4.3.101"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Memory is not freed when a CMAC key is used and associated with a CMAC algorithm in the ntp.keys file.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Memory Leak",
        "Denial of Service"
      ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending packets that trigger the memory leak, leading to memory exhaustion and ntpd failure.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, by sending specific packets",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker capable of sending network packets.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered when a CMAC key is used and associated with a CMAC algorithm in the ntp.keys file. An attacker can send packets that leverage CMAC key and algorithm configuration, which causes a memory leak in ntpd, eventually consuming available memory leading to a denial of service."
