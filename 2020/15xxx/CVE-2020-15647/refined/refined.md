Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in the content provider of Firefox for Android. The `provider_paths.xml` file used a `<root-path name="root" path="."/>` configuration which allowed the content provider to access any file on the device. This, combined with how Firefox handled `content://` URIs, allowed a malicious website to access and steal local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Content Provider Configuration:** The use of `path="."` in the `root-path` element of the content provider configuration exposed the entire file system to the provider, rather than just a specific directory as intended.
2.  **Unrestricted `content://` URI Handling:** Firefox was improperly handling `content://` URIs, allowing them to be loaded from web content (through the use of `android-app://` intents).
3.  **Content URI Overwrite:** When a `content://` URI was accessed, Firefox downloaded the file to its cache using the original filename in `/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/cache/contentUri/`. If a new file with the same name was downloaded, it would overwrite the old one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could:

*   **Remotely Steal Files:** By crafting a malicious web page, an attacker could force Firefox to download files using the `content://` scheme, and subsequently steal those files if they knew the path.
*   **Steal Sensitive Data:** This was demonstrated by exfiltrating the cookies database, potentially giving the attacker access to a user's logged-in sessions on various websites. Any file with a known path was vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a malicious website that leverages the vulnerabilities in Firefox for Android.
2.  **`android-app://` Intent:** The malicious website uses an `android-app://` intent to force Firefox to process a `content://` URI.
3.  **Forced File Download:**  Firefox downloads the requested file specified by the crafted `content://` URI, and caches it.
4.  **File Overwrite and Exfiltration:** If the downloaded file is an HTML file it loads and uses nested iframes with content:// URIs to overwrite previously downloaded files from content provider. Using JavaScript, the attacker reads the file contents (bypassing CORS due to the local origin) and exfiltrates them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Web Server:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website accessible to the victim.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs knowledge of the paths of the files they want to steal, however, common application files' paths are well-known.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was specific to Firefox for Android (Fennec) and did not affect the Fenix browser.
*   The fix included multiple patches to:
    *   Restrict `content://` URI access from web content.
    *   Use random file names when caching `content://` URI files.
    *   Always copy `content://` files to a temporary location and prevent overwriting.
    *   Restrict the paths accessible via the content provider to external storage.
    *   Prevent loading web-originated intents that open in the browser.
*   The issue was assigned a `sec-critical` severity due to the potential for widespread data theft.
*   The fix was released in Firefox for Android 68.10.1.
