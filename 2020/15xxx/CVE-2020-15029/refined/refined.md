    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript payload and entice a user to click the link while they are logged into the application or the attacker can also embed the exploit in a malicious site and have the victim access the site while logged in.",
    "additional_information": "The provided example URL is: https://ip/Assets-Management.php?st=10&sn=\"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>&an=&ty=&cl=&lo=&co=&ps=&pc=&pn=&pt=&ew=&es=&el=&ms=0&mp=&sl=&md=&mc=&sm=&em=&com=&lst=&val=&add=Add.
