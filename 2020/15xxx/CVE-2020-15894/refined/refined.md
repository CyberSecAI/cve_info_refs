Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an exposed administration function in the `getcfg.php` file. This function can be used to call various services without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The `getcfg.php` file does not adequately restrict access to administrative functions.
- **Lack of Session Checks:** The system fails to perform necessary session checks before allowing access to administrative functions.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive information, including admin login credentials (specifically the password hash).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive administrative data.
- **Credential Theft:** The disclosure of the admin password hash could lead to account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- **Direct Request:**  The attacker directly accesses the `getcfg.php` with a crafted query string via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be connected to the same network as the target device.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the exposed endpoint and how to craft the specific request.
