```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Zyxel CNM SecuManager uses hardcoded SSH server keys for the main host and chroot environments.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded SSH private keys are used for the SSH server, allowing for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. The private keys also have incorrect permissions, being world-readable. Multiple instances of the same keys are present in different chroot environments.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform MITM attacks and decrypt encrypted traffic, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based. An attacker positioned to intercept the SSH traffic to a Zyxel CNM SecuManager system can leverage the hardcoded keys.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and monitor network traffic between a client and the vulnerable Zyxel CNM SecuManager, and establish a MITM position."
