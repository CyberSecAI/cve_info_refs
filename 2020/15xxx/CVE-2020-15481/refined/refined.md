Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `DirectIo32.sys` and `DirectIo64.sys` kernel drivers, distributed with PassMark Software's BurnInTest, PerformanceTest, and OSForensics applications, contain a flaw in their IOCTL handling. Specifically, they expose functionality that allows unprivileged users to map and access arbitrary physical memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Physical Memory Access:** The drivers provide an IOCTL interface that permits any user mode process to read and write to any physical memory address. This bypasses kernel security mechanisms that are designed to prevent this kind of direct memory manipulation by user applications.
*   **Lack of Privilege Checks:** The IOCTL handler in the kernel drivers doesn't properly validate the caller's privileges before granting access to physical memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Ring-0 Code Execution:** The ability to read and write physical memory enables attackers to:
    *   Scan memory for sensitive kernel data structures and code.
    *   Patch kernel code or data, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution within the kernel's context (Ring-0).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers with low user privileges can escalate their privileges to that of the system (kernel) level. This enables them to gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable driver is loaded.
*   **User-Mode Application:**  The vulnerability is exploited using a user-mode application that interacts with the driver by calling the vulnerable IOCTL code.
* **IOCTL Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the following IOCTL (Input/Output Control) code: `IOCTL_MAP_PHYSICAL_MEMORY = 0x80112044`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine.
*   **Low User Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability, making the exploit easier to perform. The attacker can utilize this vulnerability from a normal user context, assuming the vulnerable driver is already installed on the machine.
*   **Ability to Communicate with Kernel Drivers:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable device driver.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** BurnInTest, PerformanceTest, and OSForensics applications by PassMark Software.
*   **Fix Availability:** The vulnerability was addressed in September 2020 updates of the vendor's products.
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Michal Poslušný.
*   **Timeline:** The issue was reported to the vendor on 23 June 2020 and a final fix was released on 24 July 2020. The fixed driver was integrated into products starting 9 September 2020.
