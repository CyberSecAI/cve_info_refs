Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the JWT validation process within the dp3t-sdk-backend. Specifically, the system failed to properly verify the signature of incoming JWTs when the "alg" (algorithm) header was set to "none". This allowed attackers to bypass signature verification by providing a JWT with no signature, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Signature Validation:** The core vulnerability is the lack of mandatory signature verification for JWTs.
*   **JWT "alg":"none" bypass:** The system incorrectly accepted JWTs with the "alg":"none" header, indicating no signature, without performing any checks. This effectively disables the intended security mechanism.
*   **Improper JWT handling**: The application did not enforce a requirement that JWTs must have a valid signature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Key Uploads:** An attacker could exploit this to upload or publish arbitrary keys to the backend, as the JWT validation was bypassed.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially manipulate data by controlling the uploaded keys. This could compromise the integrity and accuracy of the contact tracing system.
*   **System Compromise:**  In a wider context, this could be used to disrupt or take control of the backend services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** An attacker could construct a malicious HTTP request containing a JWT with the "alg":"none" header and send it to the vulnerable `/v1/gaen/exposed` endpoint.
*   **Direct API Abuse:** The attacker would directly interact with the vulnerable API endpoint and sending the crafted token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the backend service where the dp3t-sdk-backend is deployed.
*   **API Endpoint Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable API endpoint ( `/v1/gaen/exposed`) and the expected JWT format.
*   **Crafting JWT**: The attacker needs to be capable of creating JWTs with the header set to `{"alg":"none"}`.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.1.1 of the `dp3t-sdk-backend`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by MrSuicideParrot.
* The fix enforces that a JWT must have an algorithm other than `none`
* The fix includes a unit test to ensure that unsigned JWTs are rejected.
