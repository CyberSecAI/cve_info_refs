Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15589

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from untrusted communication between the agent and the server. The agent does not verify the identity of the server before establishing communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of server identity verification by the agent.
- Susceptibility to Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the attacker successfully impersonates the server.
- An attacker with network-level privileges could intercept the communication between the agent and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attack.
- The attacker needs network-level privileges to spoof the DNS and intercept communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the agent and the server.
- The attacker must have network-level privileges to perform DNS spoofing.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade Endpoint Central to build 100646 or later.
- Follow the steps outlined in the provided document to enable trusted communication.
