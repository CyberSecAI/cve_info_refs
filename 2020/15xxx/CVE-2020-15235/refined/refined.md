The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15235.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a flaw in the RACTF Core application where sensitive configuration keys were accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: Unauthenticated users could retrieve sensitive config keys which were intended to be restricted to administrators.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: Attackers could potentially obtain sensitive configuration data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access: Unauthenticated users could directly access the configuration data, likely through an API endpoint or similar mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special privileges are required: The attacker only needs to be unauthenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to send a request to the server to get the config data.
