## Features

* **Robust:** tested on a live event with several thousand users, and artifically stress tested to many more.
* **Split architecture:** our architecture allows you to run various components on different hosts for increased performance.
* **Highly configurable:** we have a huge array of options you can configure for your event.
* **Really awesome:** it's in the name, after all!

## Installation

Check out the [Installer](https://github.com/ractf/install/). Want a more custom deployment? Check out our [installation docs](https://docs.ractf.co.uk/installer).

## Development

The backend is a Django project, and you can spin it up easily with our
`docker-compose` setup using `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up [-d]`. Other `docker-compose` commands will also work as expected. Our tests
can be run in Docker by using `make dev-test`, or by manually running
`pytest src` in the container, for example using `docker-compose exec backend pytest src`.

## Getting Support

If you need support, check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FfW2xXR), or if you've found a bug with the framework, open an issue.
