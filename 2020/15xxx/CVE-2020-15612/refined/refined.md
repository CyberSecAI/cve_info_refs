Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_ftp_manager.php` file of CentOS Web Panel. Specifically, the `userLogin` parameter is not properly validated before being used in a system call. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The application directly uses unsanitized user-provided input within a system command, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The root cause stems from the failure to sanitize or validate the `userLogin` parameter before its incorporation into the system command.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the affected CentOS Web Panel installation. This means an attacker can gain complete control over the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
    *   **Unauthenticated access:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, making it easily exploitable by any attacker with network access to the affected server.
    *   **Specific Parameter:** The attack targets the `userLogin` parameter within the `ajax_ftp_manager.php` script.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CentOS Web Panel instance.
    *   No special privileges or authentication is required.

*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on January 23, 2020, but no patch was released by the time of public disclosure on June 25, 2020, due to the ZDI 120-day deadline policy.
    *   The ZDI provided a mitigation strategy of restricting access to the affected service via firewall rules/whitelisting.
    *   The vulnerability was assigned the CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity.
