- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in `ajax_new_account.php` where the `domain` parameter is not properly validated before being used in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can disclose sensitive information in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated attackers can send crafted requests to `ajax_new_account.php` by manipulating the `domain` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, and the attacker only needs network access to the affected system.
