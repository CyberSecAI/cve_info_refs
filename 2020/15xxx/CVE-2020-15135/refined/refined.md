Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15135:

**CVE Description:**  The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15135, which is a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability in the `save-server` npm package.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF mitigation in versions prior to v1.05 of the `save-server` package. This means that the server did not implement any mechanism to verify if a request was made intentionally by the user or by a malicious third party.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application was vulnerable to CSRF attacks due to the absence of CSRF tokens or other mitigation techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.
- **If logged in as a regular user, the impact includes:**
    - Uploading files
    - Deleting files
    - Adding redirects
- **If logged in as the root user, the impact is significantly more severe:**
    - Creating users
    - Deleting users
    - Updating user information (including password changes)
- If the root password is changed, all files would be available to the attacker using the new password.
- Note that malicious actors cannot directly view the gallery or the response to their actions due to the same-origin policy. They will not be certain if their attack was successful.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a malicious website or link that a logged-in user visits.
- When the user's browser loads the malicious site, it could send crafted requests to the vulnerable `save-server` instance, leveraging the user's active session (session key stored in cookies).
- The attacker can use this to perform actions without the user's knowledge or consent if the user has an active session on the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website.
- The user must have an active session with the vulnerable `save-server` instance (i.e. be logged in).
- The attacker doesn't need to directly interact with the server. The malicious website initiates the attack on behalf of the logged-in user's browser.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was patched by implementing the [Double Submit Cookie Pattern](https://medium.com/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/double-submit-cookie-pattern-65bb71d80d9f), which involves sending a random value in both a cookie and as a request parameter, with the server verifying if the cookie value and request value are equal.
- Users are advised to upgrade to version v1.0.7 or above to address this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information indicates that the fix implemented in v1.0.5 unintentionally broke uploading, which was corrected in v1.0.7.
- The content references OWASP for information on CSRF attacks.
- The `save-server` package allows files to be accessed by their name, ignoring the extension, which could be a security concern if not handled properly.
