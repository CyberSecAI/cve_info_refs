  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-15062",
      "vulnerability": "Exposure of the Administrative Password Over Network Broadcast",
      "root_cause": "The USB network server sends the administrator account password repeatedly and without request over the local network via UDP broadcast.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unencrypted transmission of sensitive data",
        "Use of broadcast UDP packets",
        "Lack of authentication or authorization for password retrieval",
		"Exposure of credentials"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can easily retrieve the password from the UDP broadcast messages and thus circumvent the access restrictions to the administrative interface. The attacker can then use all functions provided by the USB network server, including restricted ones. If the password is reused, this could give an attacker access to other systems that use the same password.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker on the same local network as the vulnerable device can passively listen for UDP broadcast packets and extract the admin password.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the affected device. No special access privileges on other systems are needed to intercept this information."
