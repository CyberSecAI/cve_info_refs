{
  "CVE-2020-15204": {
    "Description": "In eager mode, TensorFlow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 does not set the session state. Hence, calling `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandle` or `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandleV2` results in a null pointer dereference. In linked snippet, in eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` returns `nullptr`. Since code immediately dereferences this, we get a segmentation fault.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The session state is not set in eager mode, leading to a null pointer dereference when accessing session state related functions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A segmentation fault leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special privileges or user interaction is required, just the ability to call the affected function in eager mode."
