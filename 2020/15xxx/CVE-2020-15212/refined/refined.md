{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The TFLite implementation of segment sum does not properly validate segment IDs, leading to out-of-bounds writes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted TensorFlow Lite model with unsorted or negative segment IDs can trigger writes outside the bounds of heap-allocated buffers. This can lead to a segmentation fault or potentially be exploited for memory corruption.",
     "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor provides a specially crafted TensorFlow Lite model that contains a segment sum operation with invalid segment IDs.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TensorFlow Lite model to a system that uses it. This could be through a file, network, or other data loading mechanisms."
