The provided content describes a post-authentication SQL injection vulnerability in SiTracker v3.67 p2, specifically within the admin panel.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `criteriafield` parameter in the `report_qbe.php` page, before using it in a SQL query. The `cleanvar()` function is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database, leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application and its underlying database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted POST request to `report_qbe.php` with a malicious payload in the `criteriafield` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user to exploit this vulnerability.
