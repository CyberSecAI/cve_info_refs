Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Grocy application. Specifically, user-controlled data, such as the "Name" field when creating a new shopping list or shopping list item notes, is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the "Name" field when creating a shopping list, which is then stored in the database. When the shopping list is deleted, this stored script is rendered, leading to XSS execution in the user's browser.
*   **HTML Injection:** Arbitrary HTML code can be injected into the same input fields. This allows an attacker to modify the page content seen by the victims.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker could execute malicious JavaScript in the context of a user's session, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking by stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks
*   **HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the vulnerable pages, potentially:
     * Modifying the page content
    * Phishing attacks
    * Redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the "Shopping List" module:
    1.  An attacker logs into the application.
    2.  Navigates to the "Shopping List" module.
    3.  Creates a new shopping list with a malicious payload in the "Name" input field.
    4.  The malicious payload is stored.
    5.  When the shopping list is deleted, the stored payload is rendered without proper sanitization, executing the XSS/HTML Injection.
   * The secondary attack vector is through the shopping list item notes field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs a valid account to log in to the Grocy application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create shopping lists or add notes to shopping list items to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue was addressed by implementing a `SanitizeHtml` function, which is used to escape the HTML code and prevent the execution of malicious scripts. The fix was applied in commit `0df2590de27c60c18b7db6e056347bd2aff5a887` and `0624b0df594a4353ef25e6b1874565ea52ce7772`.
*   The vulnerability was considered low severity due to its limited impact within the intended use case of the Grocy application.
*   The vulnerability was present in versions <= 2.7.1, and fixed in versions > 2.7.1
*   The vulnerability was reported by muffyhub and fixed by berrnd.
