Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15147

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input within the "Streams" module of the Red-DiscordBot. Specifically, the module's live message formatting allowed for injection of arbitrary code through specially crafted "going live" messages. The vulnerability stems from the usage of `format()` method without proper sanitization on user-provided strings used to construct alert messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is RCE, as the injected code could be executed within the context of the bot.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code failed to sanitize user input before using it in string formatting, specifically the format method was vulnerable without proper escaping.
- **Insecure String Formatting:** User-controlled strings, taken from "going live" messages, were directly used in the message formatting logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Destructive Actions:** Attackers could execute malicious code to potentially harm the bot's functionality or the server it's running on.
- **Sensitive Information Access:**  Exploitation could grant access to sensitive information stored or accessible by the bot, potentially including API keys, tokens, or configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Discord Messages:** The attack vector is through specially crafted "going live" messages sent via Discord.
- **Streams Module:** The vulnerability exists within the "Streams" module of the bot, making it the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Discord User:** Any Discord user able to send messages and influence the "going live" message in the affected bot is capable of exploiting this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability existed in the `check_streams` function within the `streams.py` file of the `redbot/cogs/streams/` directory.
- The vulnerable code was present in both mention and nomention message processing logic where alert message string was created.
- The fix implemented was to stop using the `format()` method directly on alert messages. Instead the fix was to replace `{stream.name}` and `{stream}` with stream name using `str()`. And `{mention}` with user's mention string using `str()`.

**Patched Versions:**
The vulnerability was patched in versions `3.3.12` and `3.4` of the Red-DiscordBot.

**Workarounds:**
- Unloading the Streams module using the command `unload streams` can temporarily mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the vulnerable component.
