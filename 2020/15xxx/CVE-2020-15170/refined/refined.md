Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `apollo-adminservice` lacked built-in access control. It was designed to work within an intranet environment and did not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms. This allowed unauthenticated requests to reach the service if it was exposed to the internet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The primary weakness was the absence of access control mechanisms in the `apollo-adminservice`.
*   **Exposure to Internet:** The vulnerability was exacerbated if the `apollo-adminservice` was exposed to the internet, contrary to the intended design for intranet use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Malicious actors could directly access the `apollo-adminservice` APIs without any authentication.
*   **Configuration Modification:** Attackers could potentially access and modify the application's configurations, leading to unexpected application behavior, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exposure:** The primary attack vector was exposing the `apollo-adminservice` to the internet.
*   **Direct API Access:** Attackers could directly send requests to the service's APIs without needing to bypass any security measures.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needed network access to the exposed `apollo-adminservice` instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication credentials were needed to exploit the vulnerability, since the service lacked access control by design.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix was introduced in pull request #3233, which added an `AdminServiceAuthenticationFilter`. This filter verifies the presence of a valid access token in the `Authorization` header.
*   The fix was released in version `1.7.1`.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is considered "Low" severity, due to the fact that the admin service is not designed to be exposed to the internet, but also recognizes that this can happen, thus creating the vulnerability.
*   The advisory also suggests a workaround of not exposing the `apollo-adminservice` to the internet, in the case that upgrading the software is not possible.
