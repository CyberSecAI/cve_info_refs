Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Helm parses plugin metadata files (specifically `plugin.yaml`). It was discovered that the parser allowed duplicate entries within the file, and when duplicates were present, the last entry would always take precedence.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Duplicate Entry Parsing:** The core issue is the lack of validation against duplicate entries in `plugin.yaml`. This allows an attacker to overwrite earlier entries with malicious ones.
- **Lack of Strict YAML Parsing:** Initially, the YAML parsing was not strict, allowing duplicate keys and other undesirable YAML structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Execution Attack:** An attacker with write access to the plugin's git repository or the plugin archive (.tgz) can inject malicious code by adding a duplicate entry for a critical section in the plugin metadata (e.g., `install` hook).
- **Lowered Access Requirements:**  The attacker doesn't need a high level of access; they simply need write access during the plugin's download process (or have the ability to modify the plugin archive directly).
- **MITM Attack Potential:** A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on a non-SSL connection during plugin download could be used to inject a compromised plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Git Repository:** An attacker gaining write access to the plugin's git repository.
- **Compromised Plugin Archive:** An attacker modifies the plugin's .tgz archive.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**  An attacker intercepts the plugin download on a non-SSL connection and substitutes the legitimate archive with a malicious version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to either the plugin's git repository or the plugin archive itself.
- **Network Interception (For MITM):** For a MITM attack, the attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic during the plugin download process.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched by switching to stricter YAML parsing. Specifically, the code was changed from `yaml.Unmarshal` to `yaml.UnmarshalStrict`, which prevents duplicate keys.
- The provided commit d9ef5ce8bad512e325390c0011be1244b8380e4b shows the code changes to fix this vulnerability:
  - The code was changed from `yaml.Unmarshal` to `yaml.UnmarshalStrict` in `pkg/plugin/plugin.go`.
  - Test cases were added in `pkg/plugin/plugin_test.go` to prevent regressions.
  - A test `plugin.yaml` file with duplicate entries was added in `pkg/plugin/testdata/plugdir/bad/duplicate-entries/plugin.yaml` to verify the fix.
-  The vulnerability affects Helm versions 2.0.0-2.16.10 and 3.0.0-3.3.1
-  The patched versions are 2.16.11 and 3.3.2.
