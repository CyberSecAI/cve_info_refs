  "cve": "CVE-2020-15195",
  "description": "In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the implementation of `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` uses a double indexing pattern. It is possible for `reverse_index_map(i)` to be an index outside of bounds of `grad_values`, thus resulting in a heap buffer overflow. The issue is patched in commit 390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.",
  "affected_versions": "< 2.3.0",
  "fixed_versions": [
    "1.15.4",
    "2.0.3",
    "2.1.2",
    "2.2.1",
    "2.3.1"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check when accessing `grad_values` using an index from `reverse_index_map`, within the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` implementation. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Heap buffer overflow due to missing bounds check in SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad."
  ],
  "impact": "A heap buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution or denial of service. A successful exploit can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues.",
  "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted `reverse_index_map` tensor with out-of-bounds indices to the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` operation.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to influence the input tensors passed to the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` operation. This could be a user of the tensorflow library or someone who can control input to a tensorflow model."
