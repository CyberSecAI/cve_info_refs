- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_migration_cpanel.php` file within CentOS Web Panel. The application fails to properly validate the user-supplied `filespace` parameter before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted request containing malicious code within the `filespace` parameter to the `ajax_migration_cpanel.php` file. No authentication is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
