The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15055.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The web interface of the affected USB network servers does not properly handle the absence of the password parameter during authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass vulnerability. Specifically, the web administration interface allows access to privileged functions when the password parameter is omitted from the request.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and access administrative functions without knowing the correct password. This can lead to complete control over the device and its configuration and expose the connected USB devices to malicious manipulation.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web administration interface. By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the server without including the password parameter, an unauthenticated user can access privileged functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web administration interface of the device.
