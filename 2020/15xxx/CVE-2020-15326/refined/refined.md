{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Ejabberd process uses a hardcoded certificate and private key. Additionally, the management web service is reachable on the WAN interface and uses hardcoded credentials for authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Hardcoded certificate and private key in Ejabberd",
    "Insecure access to Ejabberd management interface on the WAN",
    "Hardcoded credentials for Ejabberd management interface",
    "World-readable configuration file containing Ejabberd credentials",
    "Hardcoded Erlang cookie for Ejabberd replication",
    "Incorrect file permissions for the configuration file"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can visit the administration interface, manage all CPEs using the default credentials, and create disruption. It may also be possible to eavesdrop on XMPP communication.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Network access to port 5280/tcp on the WAN",
    "Access to the file system to read configuration files"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the Zyxel CNM SecuManager device on port 5280/tcp and the ability to read the world readable configuration files."
