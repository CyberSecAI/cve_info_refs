{
  "CVE-2020-15900": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "A memory corruption issue was found in Artifex Ghostscript 9.50 and 9.52. Use of a non-standard PostScript operator can allow overriding of file access controls. The 'rsearch' calculation for the 'post' size resulted in a size that was too large, and could underflow to max uint32_t.",
      "Version": "9.50 and 9.52"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The 'rsearch' operator in Ghostscript had a flaw in its calculation of the 'post' size, where the size could be too large and underflow to max uint32_t",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to incorrect size calculation",
        "Ability to override file access controls due to use of non-standard PostScript operator"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary memory modification, potentially leading to sandbox escape, arbitrary file access and execution of arbitrary code.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Processing of a specially crafted PostScript file"
      ],
      "Attacker Capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a user or automated system into processing a malicious postscript file."
    },
    "Affected Products": [
      "Ghostscript 9.50",
      "Ghostscript 9.52"
    ],
     "Patches": [
