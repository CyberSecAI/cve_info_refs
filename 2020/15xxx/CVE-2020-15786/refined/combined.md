SSA-542525: Authentication Vulnerabilities in SIMATIC HMI Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.5

2020-09-08
2021-06-08
V1.3

SUMMARY

SIMATIC HMI Products are affected by two vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker to discover
user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server via a brute-force attack.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
Siemens also suggests following the listed mitigations for the Uniﬁed Comfort Panels.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply Defense-in-Depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security

• For Uniﬁed Comfort Panels using SmartClient: The password truncation (CVE-2020-15787) cannot
be resolved due to RFC 6143 and is limited to 8 characters. It is recommended to use complex
passwords

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15786

Affected devices insufﬁciently block excessive authentication attempts.

This could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server
via a brute-force attack.

CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication At-
tempts

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15787

Affected devices insufﬁciently validate authentication attempts as the information given can be trun-
cated to match only a set number of characters versus the whole provided string.

This could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server
via a brute-force attack.
