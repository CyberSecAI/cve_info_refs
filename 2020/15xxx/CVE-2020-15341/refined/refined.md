Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15341:

**CVE-2020-15341: Backdoor APIs**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Zyxel CNM SecuManager contains undocumented APIs accessible via HTTP requests without authentication. These APIs allow for various actions, including the retrieval of sensitive information.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Lack of Authentication:** The identified APIs do not require any form of authentication, making them accessible to anyone with network access to the device.
    *   **Undocumented Functionality:** These APIs are not officially documented, indicating they are not intended for public use and likely serve as backdoors.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The `/zy_get_user_id_and_key` API specifically allows the retrieval of `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` values, which are used for secure communication with the "Cloud" management platform.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive credentials used for cloud communication by exploiting these APIs.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The exposed credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the cloud management platform, leading to further compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device hosting the Zyxel CNM SecuManager.
    *   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker exploits the vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the exposed API endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
    *   No authentication or prior knowledge of valid credentials is required.

**Summary of relevant APIs:**
*   `http://[ip]:9673/update_all_realm_license?cnmid=%s`
