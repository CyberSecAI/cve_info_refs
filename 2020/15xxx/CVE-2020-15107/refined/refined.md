Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15107:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of x87 Floating Point Unit (FPU) operations within enclaves.
- A malicious host application can manipulate the Linux System V Application Binary Interface (ABI) related to x87 FPU operations. This manipulation can compromise the execution integrity of these operations within the enclave.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Violation of the Linux System V ABI for x87 FPU operations.
- Lack of proper isolation or validation of FPU operations within the enclave environment, allowing a malicious host to interfere.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Compromised Execution Integrity:** A malicious host can manipulate FPU operations in an enclave, leading to incorrect calculations or program behavior.
- **Potential Side-Channel Attacks:** Depending on how the enclave uses FPU operations, the vulnerability can potentially be used for side-channel attacks.
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** If FPU operations are used in secret-dependent paths, a successful side-channel attack could leak sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious host application is the attack vector.
- The attacker needs to control the host environment in which the vulnerable enclave is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have control over the host system.
- The attacker must be able to execute code in the host environment to manipulate the FPU ABI.
- The attacker must have an understanding of the enclave's use of FPU operations for side-channel attacks to be possible.

**Additional details:**

- This vulnerability specifically affects enclaves using x87 FPU operations.
- The issue is addressed in Open Enclave SDK version 0.10.0.
- Users are required to recompile their applications against patched libraries.
- There are no workarounds available other than recompiling against the patched library.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as low.
