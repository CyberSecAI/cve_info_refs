{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the TFLite implementation of segment sum using the last element of the segment ids tensor to determine the size of the output tensor. If the segment ids are not sorted, this can lead to an incorrect output size calculation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code assumes that segment ids are sorted and in increasing order. It uses the last element to determine the output tensor's dimensionality.",
        "There is a lack of validation on the segment IDs, which are expected to be a 1-D tensor with values in the range [0, k-1] and be monotonically increasing without any jumps, with k being the size of the input tensor's first dimension."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a large value as the last element of the segment IDs. This will lead to a large memory allocation, which can result in an out-of-memory condition. Additionally, if the segment IDs are not sorted, this can also lead to an out-of-bounds write due to the allocation of insufficient memory for the output tensor.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted TensorFlow Lite model with unsorted or large last element in segment IDs tensor."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted TFLite model or control the segment IDs input to the TFLite segment sum operation. An attacker with control over the model or inputs can cause a denial-of-service or memory corruption by providing an unsorted array as `segment_ids` or a large last element."
