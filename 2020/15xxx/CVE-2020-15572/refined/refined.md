Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15572

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds memory access during certificate comparison in the connection handshake when Tor is compiled with the NSS (Network Security Services) library.
*   The core issue is an API mismatch where NSS was reporting the number of bits, while the Tor code was expecting the number of bytes leading to out of bound comparison.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Out-of-bounds memory access.
*   Incorrect handling of bit/byte units received from the NSS library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a Tor instance to crash remotely.
*   Affected Tor relays and clients will crash.
*   Relays can be crashed remotely by any party during the handshake.
*   Clients can be crashed by their guards during the handshake.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote attack via connection handshake.
*   Any party initiating a connection handshake with a vulnerable Tor instance can trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a connection handshake with a Tor instance compiled with NSS library. This includes being able to connect to a Tor relay as a client, or a Tor client connecting to a relay.

**Additional Information:**
*   This vulnerability affects all supported versions of Tor when compiled with NSS, which is not the default setting.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as both TROVE-2020-001 and CVE-2020-15572.
*   Fixed in Tor versions 0.3.5.11, 0.4.2.8, 0.4.3.6, and 0.4.4.2-alpha and later.
*   The issue does not affect installations built using OpenSSL.
