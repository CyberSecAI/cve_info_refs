Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `fileName` parameter in the `getDataFilePath` method within the `DataFileTools.java` class. This allows a malicious user to potentially pass a file path instead of a filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By providing a crafted `fileName` that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can navigate outside of the intended data directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker could access arbitrary files on the server that the application server user (e.g., Tomcat) has access to. This includes configuration files, source code, or other potentially sensitive data.
* The impact is limited to files that the application server user has permission to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP request to the file servlet of the Goobi viewer Core application.
*   An attacker would need to manipulate the `fileName` parameter when requesting a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Goobi viewer Core application.
*  **Understanding of API:** The attacker needs to know which API endpoint to target and which parameters to manipulate to trigger the path traversal.
*   **No Authentication required:** No authentication required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented in commit `44ceb8e2e7e888391e8a941127171d6366770df3` involves extracting the filename from the provided path using `Paths.get(fileName).getFileName().toString()`, which effectively strips out any path traversal sequences, ensuring only the filename is used.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 4.8.3 and was fixed in version 4.8.3.
* A workaround is suggested by using mod_rewrite in an Apache proxy server to restrict access to the file servlet.
