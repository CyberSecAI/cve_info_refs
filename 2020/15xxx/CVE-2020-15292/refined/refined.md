- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of validation on data read from guest memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Out-of-bounds read
    - Denial of Service (DoS) due to integer overflow in `IntPeGetDirectory`
    - Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) condition in `IntPeParseUnwindData`
    - Insufficient validations
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Out-of-bounds read
    - Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Attack vectors**: Specific functions within Bitdefender HVI that read from guest memory (`IntPeGetDirectory`, `IntPeParseUnwindData`, `IntLogExceptionRecord`, `IntKsymExpandSymbol`, and `IntLixTaskDumpTree`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access (as indicated by AV:L in CVSS). A malicious guest OS could exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional details**:
- The vulnerability is fixed in Introcore 1.132.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ilja Van Sprundel from IOActive.
