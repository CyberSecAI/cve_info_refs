Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in weak folder permissions for the IDrive for Windows installation directory. By default, the installation directory `C:\Program Files(x86)\IDriveWindows` and its subfolders have "Modify" permissions granted to `NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users`. This allows any authenticated user to modify the contents of this directory, including executable files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File System Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the overly permissive file system permissions on the IDrive installation directory. This allows any authenticated user to write and modify files within the directory.
*   **Privileged Service Execution:** The IDrive application installs a service named `IDriveService` that runs with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. This service executes binaries located within the vulnerable installation directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with standard user privileges can replace the legitimate `IDriveService` executable with a malicious one. When the service is started or restarted, the malicious binary will execute with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, granting the attacker full control over the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges on the system. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the Windows machine where IDrive is installed.
*   **File Replacement:** An attacker must replace the legitimate service binary with a malicious one within the vulnerable installation folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Standard User Account:** The attacker needs only a standard user account on the affected Windows system.
*   **File Modification Rights:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the vulnerable directory which is granted to Authenticated Users.
*   **Knowledge of Service Location:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `IDriveService` executable, which is located within the installation directory.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was patched in IDrive for Windows version 6.7.3.19.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Hashim Jawad of ACTIVELabs.
