  "CVE-2020-15652": {
    "description": "By observing the stack trace for JavaScript errors in web workers, it was possible to leak the result of a cross-origin redirect. This applied only to content that can be parsed as script.",
    "root_cause": "The stack trace of a JavaScript error in web workers contained the full URL of a redirected cross-origin script, leaking potentially sensitive data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "CORS Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially access sensitive information (e.g., authorization tokens, CSRF tokens) embedded in the redirected URL, bypassing CORS restrictions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web worker loading a cross-origin script.",
      "Cross-origin script redirect."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a domain from where the worker is loading the script. Additionally, they need the ability to cause a redirect from that domain to a different one, the resulting redirected URL should contain the sensitive information and be a script that can throw an error",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability only occurs with content that can be parsed as a script, HTML documents do not lead to the vulnerability. The issue was that the final URL was being shown even if the redirect chain resulted in a cross-origin. The fix is to show the initial URL if the final URL is cross-origin."
