Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-15133:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `Faye::WebSocket::Client` class in the `faye-websocket-ruby` gem uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls` method from the `eventmachine` gem for TLS handshakes with `wss:` URLs. This `start_tls` method, by default, does not perform TLS certificate verification, meaning it doesn't check if the server presents a valid and trusted certificate for the expected hostname.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Missing TLS certificate verification.
- Vulnerability to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because the client doesn't verify the identity of the server it connects to.

**Impact of exploitation:**

A successful MitM attack allows an attacker to intercept and modify WebSocket communications between the client and the server. This can lead to:
- Data theft or manipulation.
- Injection of malicious code.
- Impersonation of the server, potentially redirecting the client to a malicious server.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network-level MitM attack: An attacker positioned between the client and the server can intercept the initial handshake, present a malicious certificate, and then eavesdrop/tamper with the communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a network position to intercept the communication between the client and the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to present a TLS certificate, which will be trusted by the client if the client does not perform verification of the certificate.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability exists in `faye-websocket-ruby` versions prior to 0.11.0.
- The fix involves implementing TLS verification using the OpenSSL module, checking both the certificate chain and hostname validity, enabled by default, with a possibility to disable verification.
- The `eventmachine` library provides the `ssl_verify_peer` extension point which `faye-websocket-ruby` now uses to implement the certificate verification.
- The fix includes two new options for the `Faye::WebSocket::Client` constructor: `tls.root_cert_file` and `tls.verify_peer`.
  -  `:root_cert_file` allows users to specify a path to a certificate file to be used instead of system root certificates.
  - `:verify_peer` allows users to disable certificate verification entirely (not recommended).
- The `faye` gem is also affected due to its use of `em-http-request` and `faye-websocket-ruby` but its vulnerability is fixed by requiring the underlying libraries support TLS verification before it can claim to do the same.
- The `em-http-request` gem also had the same vulnerability and was fixed by implementing TLS verification and has the `:verify_peer` option disabled by default, whereas `faye-websocket-ruby` has it enabled by default.
