## Description

![@duesee](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8997731?u=d7c9423ce524f07544a1e95e298b263a0d103b4b&v=4&size=48)[duesee](https://github.com/duesee)opened [on Jun 18, 2020](https://github.com/dinhvh/libetpan/issues/386#issue-641155783)

We found a STARTTLS issue in libEtPan which affects IMAP (and probably other protocols.)

When the server responds with its "let's do TLS now message", e.g. `A OK begin TLS\r\n`, libEtPan will read any data after the \r\n and save it into some internal buffer for later processing. This is problematic, because a MITM attacker can inject arbitrary responses. I havn't tested it to this extent, but I suspect that this is enough to forge entire mailboxes even though STARTTLS is used.

There is a nice blogpost by Wietse Venema about a "command injection" in postfix (<http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html>). What we have here is the problem in reverse, i.e. not a command injection, but a "response injection."

Example trace to give an intuition:

```
C: A STARTTLS
S: A OK begin TLS
   B OK answer future login command // injected response
<--- TLS --->
C: B login user pass
// here, libEtPan interprets the injected "B OK" response and proceeds...
C: C noop
...

```

An attacker can probably inject more responses and (in the worst case) mimic a whole session.

There are (from my view) three possible fixes: 1) discard any remaining data after stls, 2) shovel the extra data into the TLS layer (where it belongs), and 3) error out as this is clearly a protocol violation.

The (maybe silly or even wrong) commit in [duesee@5462750#diff-b01e5693616d9ee0714273a3491bc713](https://github.com/duesee/libetpan/commit/54627507a6979635016e149b1f5f738ff67cedab#diff-b01e5693616d9ee0714273a3491bc713) seems to fix the issue (please ignore the .idea folder :P)

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-15945.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-15954.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-15953 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15953)

#### Description

LibEtPan through 1.9.4, as used in MailCore 2 through 0.6.3 and other products, has a STARTTLS buffering issue that affects IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. When a server sends a "begin TLS" response, the client reads additional data (e.g., from a meddler-in-the-middle attacker) and evaluates it in a TLS context, aka "response injection."

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 33 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [BINUTILS235](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS235 "Changes/BINUTILS235")
* [CMake to do out-of-source builds](/wiki/Changes/CMake_to_do_out-of-source_builds "Changes/CMake to do out-of-source builds")

* [F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 22nd. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f33
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f33. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f33 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f33
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-27 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.
