  "CVE-2020-15953": {
    "Description": "LibEtPan through 1.9.4, as used in MailCore 2 through 0.6.3 and other products, has a STARTTLS buffering issue that affects IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. When a server sends a \"begin TLS\" response, the client reads additional data (e.g., from a meddler-in-the-middle attacker) and evaluates it in a TLS context, aka \"response injection.\"",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The libetpan library improperly handles the STARTTLS handshake, specifically by reading and buffering extra data after the server sends a 'begin TLS' response, before the TLS connection is established.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Response Injection: The vulnerability lies in the fact that the library reads and buffers data beyond the expected STARTTLS response. An attacker can inject malicious data disguised as server responses, which libetpan then processes.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary responses, potentially leading to session hijacking or the forgery of entire mailboxes. This could result in a breach of integrity and confidentiality of the connection and the transmitted data.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: An attacker intercepts network traffic between a client and a server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and server. They need to send malicious responses at the time of the STARTTLS negotiation after the server indicates it is beginning TLS."
