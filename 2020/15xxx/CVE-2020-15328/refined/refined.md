  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ZODB (Zope Object Database) service runs without authentication, and the database files have world-readable permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open ZODB storage without authentication",
      "World-readable file permissions on ZODB storage files"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive information including cookies, passwords, hashes, access control parameters, python code, serialized python variables and logs from TR-069. Potential for pre-auth RCE as 'axess' if exposed on the WAN.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the ZODB service on port 8100/tcp.",
      "File system access to world-readable ZODB data files."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to port 8100/tcp or access to the filesystem on the device to read the world-readable files."
