Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `grub_cmd_initrd` and `grub_initrd_init` functions within GRUB2's efilinux component when handling the `initrd` command. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the size of arguments passed to the initrd command or a crafted filesystem with very large files. This can result in a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Integer overflow in initrd size handling.
*   Lack of size validation when allocating memory for initrd data.
*   Heap-based buffer overflow.
*   The efilinux component of GRUB2 is affected (but not upstream GRUB2).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution during the boot process.
*   Bypassing UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
*   Potential for persistent malware or bootkits to be installed.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local attacker, with administrative privileges (or physical access)
*   Crafting a malicious GRUB2 configuration file (grub.cfg) with a large number of arguments to the initrd command, especially on 32-bit systems.
*  Crafting a filesystem with very large files on any architecture.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Local access to the system with administrative privileges is required to modify the grub.cfg file or to attach a crafted filesystem.
*   Ability to control the contents of the `grub.cfg` file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in GRUB2 as shipped in Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu and their derivatives
*   The issue is specific to the efilinux component and does not affect the upstream GRUB2.
*  The vulnerability can be triggered by an extremely large number of arguments to the initrd command on 32-bit architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on any architecture.
*  Mitigation requires updating GRUB2, and in some cases updated shims and kernels, along with updates to the UEFI revocation list (dbx).

This CVE allows a local attacker with root access or the ability to modify the boot configuration to bypass Secure Boot and take control of the operating system during boot, which is considered a critical security vulnerability.
