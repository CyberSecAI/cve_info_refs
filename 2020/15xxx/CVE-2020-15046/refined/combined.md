We partnered with Triton Infosec to perform a web application test on a critical tool for our clientâs organization. Their findings helped us significantly reduce risk prior to deployment to production. Would certainly use their services again.

**Shay C**

*Managing Partner at Coastal Cyber*

My team was building a system to manage intelliget cities and we wanted to ensure that it was secure. Triton Infosec was hired to test the security of the platform because of their vast experience. Thankfully, they uncovered problems that would have had real world consequences if it was discovered out in the wild. Looking forward to partering with Triton on future projects.

#### OPINION

## What our clients say

One of our large clients needed an external penetration test across infrastructure spanning multiple continents. Because the test required seasoned professionals, we hired Triton Infosec to perform the test. The client was impressed that Triton was able to bypass MFA. Consequently, we have made a long-term client.
