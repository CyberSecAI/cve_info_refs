The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15474.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by a missing length check in the `extractRDNSequence` function within the `tls.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper bounds checking when processing the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) sequence in TLS certificates.
- A fixed-size buffer `rdnSeqBuf` is used to store the RDN sequence which can overflow if the input data is larger than the buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack overflow, potentially leading to a crash or possibly arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TLS certificate with a large RDN sequence.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to provide a malicious TLS certificate to the vulnerable system.
- This likely means the attacker would need to be in a man-in-the-middle position or be able to influence a TLS handshake.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for the vulnerability involves adding a length check to prevent the `rdnSeqBuf` from overflowing and increasing the buffer size.
- The commit message "Fixed stack overflow caused by missing length check" explicitly states the issue being addressed.
- The diff shows the addition of a check `if (*rdnSeqBuf_offset >= rdnSeqBuf_len)` to prevent further processing when the buffer limit is reached.
- The size of `rdnSeqBuf` is also increased from 1024 to 2048.
