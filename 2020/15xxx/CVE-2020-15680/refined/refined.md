Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15680:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles image loading when the `src` attribute references an external protocol handler. Firefox exhibits different behaviors when attempting to load an image from a valid registered protocol handler versus a non-existent one. Specifically, the size of the broken image placeholder differs depending on whether the protocol handler exists or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that Firefox leaks information about the presence of external protocol handlers registered on a user's system. This is achieved by the distinct rendering of broken image placeholders.
*   **Differential Behavior:** The core weakness is the inconsistent handling of image loading for existing vs non-existing protocol handlers, leading to measurable differences.
*   **Image Sizing:** The size of the generated image element differs when loading an image with a registered protocol vs a non-registered one, which is the basis for the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Protocol Handler Enumeration:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to brute-force enumerate the protocol handlers present on a user's system.
*   **Fingerprinting:** This information can be used for browser fingerprinting, improving the accuracy of identifying a user's system configuration.
*   **Reconnaissance:** Attackers could use this information to:
    *   Identify communication channels or social apps installed.
    *   Gain insights into installed applications (music players, IDEs, etc.).
    *   Detect the presence of specific security solutions (antivirus, etc.).
    *   Customize attacks based on the discovered information.
*   **Pre-Exploitation Detection:** Exploit kits could use this to check for the presence of vulnerable applications before launching an exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Tags:** The primary attack vector is embedding image tags on a web page with URLs that use various protocol handlers as the `src`.
*   **JavaScript:** JavaScript is used to measure the size of the rendered image elements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Page Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious HTML (containing the image tags and JavaScript) onto a page viewed by the target user. This can be done through malicious websites, injected ads, or cross-site scripting attacks.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** The attack relies on the ability to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **No user interaction needed** beyond visiting the malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was tested on Firefox 78.0.1 (64-bit) on Windows 10.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the image blocking status is set appropriately when a channel fails to be created during an image request. This makes the browser treat all failures to load from an external protocol the same.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 82.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "moderate" severity.
