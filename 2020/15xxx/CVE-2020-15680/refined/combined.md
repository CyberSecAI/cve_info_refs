Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

Dear Mozilla,

Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs have discovered a security issue in your product Firefox on 8/12/2020. We estimate its risk level is 2, on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest), in terms of its impact. Please advise of the appropriate contact person in your company to handle this issue.

Fortinet's research remains ethical at all times, and we therefore strive to Responsible Disclosure. Fortinet vulnerability disclosure policy can be found at <https://fortiguard.com/zeroday/responsible-disclosure>.

For this particular issue, we will wait until 9/13/2020 for vendor response before we post an advisory on our website (<https://fortiguard.com/zeroday>) and/or any other publication form (e.g. conference talk, demo, podcast, etc.).

In the case you agree to patch this issue, we'll extend the disclosure deadline to 90 days (it's 11/13/2020 for this issue) automatically.

We might disclose it *earlier* than that date only if:

1. Public proof of concept code for the vulnerability is released or it's disclosed by other people, increasing the danger of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild;
2. Active attack against the vulnerability is detected;
3. Or you have patched the vulnerability or released solution/workaround - a positive fact we'll be happy to mention.

Fortinet will use reasonable efforts to communicate a schedule of planned mediums, including conferences with the appropriate stakeholders within the affected company.

Our security researchers work on your product or service either because it is popular and/or interesting, so please take this positively. This research is done free of charge for you, although our researchers will appreciate being mentioned in a Hall of Fame or bug bounty if any. Threats to our security researchers are not acceptable and will be dealt with by our Legal team.

Kind regards,

Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.

## Vulnerability Description:

This vulnerability has been tested on Firefox 78.0.1 (64-bit) under Windows 10. To leak the protocol handlers in Firefox, we leverage differences in the way Firefox renders images sourced from existing and non-existing protocol handlers.

For example, if we try to load a web page containing the following element -

<img src=”search-ms://abc”>

and observe the elements styling using developer tools, we would see that the default styling for broken images generates element with size of 24x24. Unlike the example above, if we try to create an image element and set source to some non-existent handler like the following -

<img src=”NonExistingHandler://abc”>

this will result with an element with different sizing of 0x0.

This difference can be measured using a simple JS script. Basing on this, a malicious actor may perform a brute-force attack to disclose the different protocol handlers on a targeted system.

please note that the ff.html file contains the PoC for this vulnerability.

Thanks,

Rotem Kerner

Some words about impact -

## Vulnerabilities Impact

Such information disclosure vulnerability could be exploited in several different ways. Here are some examples:

* Identifying communication channels: By listing the handlers an attacker can get a hint to what platforms he may use for reaching the targeted user. For instance, detecting social applications such as slack, skype, whatsapp or telegram may be used for communicating with the target.
* General reconnaissance: A wide range of applications nowadays uses custom URL handlers and can be detected using this vulnerability. Some examples: music players, IDE, office applications, crypto-mining, browsers, mail applications, antivirus, video conferencing, virtualizations, database clients, version control clients, chat clients, voice conference apps, shared storages
* Pre-exploitation detection: Exploit kits may leverage this information in order to identify if a potentially vulnerable application is present without exposing the vulnerability itself.
* Detecting Security solutions: The Table bellow contains a list of some security solutions whose presence can be exposed by leveraging the vulnerabilities because they have custom protocol handlers installed. Attackers may use this to further customize their attack to be able to circumvent any protection mechanism set by those security solutions.
* User Fingerprinting: reading what protocol handlers exist on a system may also be used in order to improve browser/user fingerprinting algorithms.

Emilio, I debugged this a little bit, and AFAICT the issue is that for known protocols, creating the channel works but calling AsyncOpen fails with `NS_ERROR_CONTENT_BLOCKED`. For unknown protocols, creating the channel [fails immediately](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3434a9df60373a997263107e6f124fb164ddebf2/uriloader/exthandler/nsExternalProtocolHandler.cpp#518-524).

What I don't really understand is that it would seem that the DOM image loading content's `mBroken` is set in both cases, but only one of them ends up showing the "broken image" placeholder. Do you have ideas about this?

(I'll note that this distinction could well mean that there are event firing differences between the two loads, too, in addition to the broken image difference, and so maybe the correct fix would be to make both attempts fail at the same time rather than only fixing the broken image rendering - it's hard for me to tell as I'm not familiar with the code so I'm unsure which behaviour is closer to the one we want.)

we shoudl check what type of error event is sent to onerror and make sure they can't pick up the difference that way, too.

This looks similar to [bug 1626068](/show_bug.cgi?id=1626068 "NEW - Try to not expose known/unknown protocols so easily."). See the test-case in the dev-platform thread for example, `<iframes>` with unknown protocols show an error page, which is considered cross-origin, and thus `.contentDocument` and so on is not accessible and throws.

We can probably mitigate this for `<img>`, and maybe for `<iframe>` as well. Other browsers also expose this information similarly, see that thread.

Main concerns is that some applications may legitimately use this to detect whether their protocol is registered, and offering you some sort of install prompt instead. This is definitely a fingerprinting surface.

The sizing of the image can probably be explained by different outcome in one of these lines: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3434a9df60373a997263107e6f124fb164ddebf2/layout/generic/nsImageFrame.cpp#192-203>

FWIW, I don't think we should be exposing what URL schemes the user has functionality for to the web even if there might be legitimate usage and we should try getting rid of it mostly per the design Emilio and I came up with. One adjustment we have to make for compatibility, as illustrated by [bug 1650162](/show_bug.cgi?id=1650162 "VERIFIED FIXED - Teams, goedit, Roblox, GoToMeeting and Steam \"hidden iframe\" links in Firefox 78.0.1 don’t work"), is that navigating the frame to such a URL scheme should still cause the new tab or app to be opened.

I agree that we need to be careful about rolling this out, but I don't think it's an acceptable end state to keep leaking this forever.

This is the same status as we do for known no-data protocols here:

I finally took some time to look at this. On the "unregistered protocol" case, we fail to create a channel. We reject the known-protocol image load via CSP instead, which sets a different image blocking status.

Yes; our workflow will issue a CVE when we have issued a fix; now that there is a patch, it will likely go out Firefox 82.

I used the attached file "ff.html" on latest Nightly 83.0a1 (09.22.2020) and on Beta 81.b9. ON both builds I observed under Inspector two elements one of 0x0 size and one of 24x24 size. Also on both I have the following error in browser console:

NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED: Component returned failure code: 0x80004001 (NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED) [nsIHandlerInfo.hasDefaultHandler] HandlerService.js:482

fillHandlerInfo jar:file:///C:/Users/brindusa.tot/Desktop/LatestNightly64/omni.ja!/components/HandlerService.js:482

Rotem, am I missing something? What are the differences I should see on a build with the fix vs a build without the fix?

On fixed builds you should see all handlers reported as "Exists", regardless of whether they exist on your system.

For a build with the fix, latest Nightly 83.0a1 (Build ID 20200922154306), I have 2 handlers reported with "Does not exists":

- Handler https Does not exists

- Handler http Does not exists

For a build without the fix, there are a lot of handlers with does not exists (around 47).

Is this correct?

Yeah, that sounds good. http/https being reported as not existing are kinda a bug in the test-case (because in that case we actually perform a connection but the test-case tests synchronously).

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

# Undefined Behavior in bounded channel

High

[taiki-e](/taiki-e)
published
GHSA-v5m7-53cv-f3hx
Oct 14, 2020

## Package

cargo

crossbeam-channel
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

=0.4.3

## Patched versions

>=0.4.4

## Description

### Impact

The affected version of this crate's the `bounded` channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements.

### Patches

This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.

We recommend users to upgrade to 0.4.4.

### References

See [#533](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/533), [#539](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/539), and [rustsec/advisory-db#425](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/425) for more details.

Mark Wodrich of Google
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free bug in the usersctp library was reported upstream. We assume this could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-15254: Undefined behavior in bounded channel of crossbeam rust crate](#CVE-2020-15254)

Reporter
Caelum van Ispelen
Impact
high
##### Description

In the crossbeam rust crate, the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from\_iter had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from\_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from\_iter had allocated different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined, but in another use case, the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.

#### [#CVE-2020-15680: Presence of external protocol handlers could be determined through image tags](#CVE-2020-15680)

Reporter
Rotem Kerner
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a valid external protocol handler was referenced in an image tag, the resulting broken image size could be distinguished from a broken image size of a non-existent protocol handler. This allowed an attacker to successfully probe whether an external protocol handler was registered.

Reporter
Alon Zakai
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When multiple WASM threads had a reference to a module, and were looking up exported functions, one WASM thread could have overwritten another's entry in a shared stub table, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

Reporter
Lijo A.T.
Impact
low
##### Description

When a link to an external protocol was clicked, a prompt was presented that allowed the user to choose what application to open it in. An attacker could induce that prompt to be associated with an origin they didn't control, resulting in a spoofing attack. This was fixed by changing external protocol prompts to be tab-modal while also ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different origin.
