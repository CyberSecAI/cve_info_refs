{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hardcoded configuration parameters within the `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` file, specifically `APP_KEY`, `OAUTH_SECRET_KEY`, and potentially others.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded secrets, insecure API usage, weak encryption practices.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, and compromise of cloud communication.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the hardcoded keys within `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess`, possibly through network interception or by accessing the file system. The hardcoded keys are used to communicate with the 'Cloud' management.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to the file system or the network traffic involving communication between the appliance and the cloud to extract the hardcoded keys. Access to the web interface or ability to MITM the traffic could be helpful."
