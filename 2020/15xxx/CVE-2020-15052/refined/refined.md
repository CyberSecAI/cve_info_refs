      "content": "The content is related to CVE-2020-15052.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the Artica Proxy software. Specifically, the 'Netmask', 'Hostname', and 'Alias' fields are vulnerable to SQL Injection. This means that user-supplied input to these fields is not properly escaped or validated before being used in an SQL query.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided input into SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- Input Fields: The attack is executed by entering malicious SQL code into the 'Netmask', 'Hostname', and 'Alias' input fields of the Artica Proxy web interface.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to have access to the Artica Proxy web interface to input the malicious SQL code via the vulnerable input fields.\n-The provided payload "*1\" GROUP BY 1,2,--*" can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe affected product is Artica Proxy Community Edition before version 4.28.030418 (or 4.30.000000 per the repository description). The vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability. The exploit was authored by Pratiksha Dhone."
