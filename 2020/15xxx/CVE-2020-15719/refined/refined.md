Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15719:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `lists.opensuse.org` explicitly mentions "CVE-2020-15719" as a cross-reference for a security update affecting `openldap2`.
*  The content from `bugzilla.redhat.com` has a bug report with the summary "TLS setup should not fall back to matching CN if there is a SAN that does not match the server's host name" and cross-references CVE-2020-15719
*   The content from `www.suse.com` specifically addresses CVE-2020-15719, describing it as "libldap in certain third-party OpenLDAP packages has a certificate-validation flaw when the third-party package is asserting RFC6125 support. It considers CN even when there is a non-matching subjectAltName (SAN)."
* The content from `access.redhat.com` also references the CVE.

Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2020-15719.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from `libldap` in certain OpenLDAP packages incorrectly falling back to Common Name (CN) validation when a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) is present, but doesn't match the server's hostname during TLS certificate verification. This behavior violates the recommendations of RFC6125.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper certificate validation
    *   Failure to prioritize SAN over CN during TLS handshake, despite RFC6125 recommendations
    *   Use of custom hostname verification logic instead of the OpenSSL API

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass hostname verification checks. This could allow a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker presents a certificate with a matching CN but a non-matching SAN, thus tricking the client into trusting the attacker's server. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information if a client is tricked into connecting to a malicious server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   Network-based attacks where the attacker can intercept and modify the traffic.
    *   The vulnerability is exploited during the TLS handshake process.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or redirect network traffic between the client and the server.
    *   The attacker needs to have a certificate where the CN matches the targeted server's hostname but a non-matching SAN.
    *   The attacker is impersonating a legitimate server

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `libldap` library where, instead of prioritizing the SAN for hostname verification, it falls back to using the CN if the SAN does not match. The content notes this violates the spirit of RFC6125 which gives SAN the priority, with CN a deprecated fallback.
*   Some content clarifies that the vulnerability isn't present in the stock version of OpenLDAP, but instead, it was introduced by a patch in specific OpenLDAP packages used in Linux distributions.
*  The bug report in `bugzilla.redhat.com` indicates that a custom function was used, rather than leveraging the OpenSSL API directly.
* Patches were made to use the OpenSSL API directly, and avoid the use of custom functions for hostname verification

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The content from `www.oracle.com` discusses a Critical Patch Update that includes fixes for multiple vulnerabilities including one within "Oracle Blockchain Platform". Notably the content states "The patch for CVE-2019-13565 also addresses... CVE-2020-15719". This implies that a vulnerability related to the CVE may exist in Oracle Blockchain Platform and is not the core issue.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that `openldap` versions prior to `2.4.46-10.el8` are affected, while the `access.redhat.com` page points to the fix being present in `openldap-2.4.46-10.el8` and higher.
*   Several SUSE Security Advisories were published to address this issue in various SUSE products.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**
CVE-2020-15719 is a certificate validation issue in the `libldap` library that causes it to incorrectly fall back to CN when the SAN does not match. This flaw breaks the expected order of precedence between CN and SAN defined in RFC 6125 leading to potential MITM attacks. Patches involve a change to use the OpenSSL API instead of custom logic for hostname verification. Affected products and versions include certain OpenLDAP packages as well as related distributions like Red Hat and SUSE Linux.
