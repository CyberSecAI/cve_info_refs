- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Code injection and privilege escalation vulnerability in seccryptocfg templates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection and privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform code injection and privilege escalation. This could lead to full control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the `seccryptocfg` templates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable system remotely and does not require authentication.
