The issue with setup.cache is still problematic. 1, The code to ensure backward comparability is problematic. E.g. in /usr/sbin/faxsetup (but also in other scripts):    780 if [ -e $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache ] && [ ! -e $DIR_LIBDATA/setup.cache ]; then    781     ln $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache $DIR_LIBDATA/setup.cache    782 fi    783 if [ -e $SPOOL/etc/setup.modem ] && [ ! -e $DIR_LIBDATA/setup.modem ]; then    784     ln $SPOOL/etc/setup.modem $DIR_LIBDATA/setup.modem    785 fi   so this hard links the potentially attacker controlled file to /etc/hylafax. If the attacker created this file, then it's linked into /etc/hylafax and can still be controlled by the attacker.     It's tricky to solve this without breaking existing installations, which I see as the bigger problem so I'll skip this 2, Some binaries still use the old file: /var/spool/hylafax/bin/faxrcvd: . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/mkcover: . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/notify:  . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/pcl2fax: . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/pdf2fax.gs:      . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/pollrcvd:        . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/ps2fax.gs:       . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/tiff2fax:        . etc/setup.cache /var/spool/hylafax/bin/tiff2pdf:        . etc/setup.cache  This must be fixed. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-09-18 16:50:41 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:1438-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.

But I will not invest more time into this, I don't see that we will get to a state where this is better and in the end this isn't software that will be used for much longer I assume ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c10)  Hans-Peter Jansen   2020-10-20 08:41:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c9)) > Well we can of course patch this away. But I will not invest more time into > this, I don't see that we will get to a state where this is better and in > the end this isn't software that will be used for much longer I assume  I beg to differ.  As long as we share our planet with bureaucrats and attorneys, fax isn't going to disappear any time soon.  What's mitigating the "dark" side of this package, I cannot imagine a sane reason to run this anywhere but in isolated environments (PBX, etc.). We might want to add a warning to the README.  Thank you for investing your time, Johannes and Axel.  Axel, sorry for leaving you alone with all this mess. I finally tidied up my Asterisk build yesterday, and will hopefully migrate my PBX from * 16.9 to * 17.7 today, with all this pulling behind... I even own a physical fax now (HP 1415 Mufu..), that is already attached to a Cisco SPA112 phone adapter. Symptomatic for this area, it is still dysfunctional. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c11)  Axel Braun   2020-11-01 21:33:20 UTC  ``` As we cant do much on this one - as I understand Johannes - there is not really anything left. @Pete - feel free to add to the README. @Joahnnes - I propose to close the issue ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c12)  Johannes Segitz   2020-11-13 07:42:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Axel Braun from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c11)) agreed ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c13)  Hans-Peter Jansen   2020-11-13 10:01:23 UTC  ``` What do you think about (on top of README.SUSE):  GENERAL NOTE ============ Due to history and structure of this package, the server part of HylaFAX+  should only be installed in isolated environments for security reasons, with direct access for admins only. [[bsc#1173519](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1173519)] ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c14)  Johannes Segitz   2020-11-16 13:59:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Hans-Peter Jansen from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1173519#c13)) yes, that is something we can do, although I don't expect many people will read this ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1852803#c0)  Marian Rehak    2020-07-01 10:53:43 UTC  ``` HylaFAX+ through 7.0.2 and HylaFAX Enterprise have scripts that execute binaries from directories writable by unprivileged users (e.g., locations under /var/spool/hylafax that are writable by the uucp account). This allows these users to execute code in the context of the user calling these binaries (often root).
