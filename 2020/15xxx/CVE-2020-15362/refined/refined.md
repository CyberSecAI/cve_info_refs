- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `wifiscanner` module does not sanitize user-provided inputs for the binary path and arguments, which are directly used in a `childProcess.exec()` call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization, command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution on the server/system running the `wifiscanner` module. An attacker can execute any command with the privileges of the user running the Node.js application.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing malicious arguments or a malicious binary path via the `options` object when instantiating the `wifiscanner` object, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands that are executed by the underlying shell through `childProcess.exec()`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `options` object passed when instantiating the `wifiscanner` module. This could be through insecurely processing user input or configuration.
