Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a tampered APK (Android Package Kit) of the "Chameleon Mini Live Debugger" application found on the Google Play Store. The tampered version includes an additional, unexpected permission: `READ_PHONE_STATE`.
*   The author of the application suspects that a malicious actor may have tampered with the application on the Play Store.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Tampered Application:** The core issue is the presence of a modified application package on the official Google Play Store, not originating from the legitimate developer.
*   **Added Permission:** The tampered APK has a newly added permission, `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`, which is not present in the legitimate version. This permission allows the application to access sensitive phone information.
*   **Lack of Integrity Verification:** The incident highlights a lack of integrity verification mechanisms either within the Play Store distribution process or on the user's device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** The `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission can allow the malicious application to access sensitive user data such as the phone number, IMEI, and other device identifiers.
*   **Potential for Further Malicious Activity:**  This access could be used to enable other malicious activities, such as targeted tracking or fraud.
*   **User Trust Erosion:**  Compromised applications in the official store can erode user trust in the platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Supply Chain Attack:** The attack vector is a supply chain attack on the Google Play Store distribution mechanism. A malicious party was able to upload a compromised version of an existing application.
*   **Distribution Platform Compromise:** The attacker did not directly exploit the application code or the user's device, but rather compromised the distribution channel, specifically the Google Play Store.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Play Store Distribution Channel:** The attacker needs a way to upload the tampered APK onto the Google Play Store, either by gaining access to the developer's account or by exploiting some vulnerability in the store's processes.
*  **APK Modification:**  The attacker needs the capability to modify an existing APK file and inject a new permission without breaking the app's functionality.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.1.8 of the application, and the developer urges users to update immediately.
*   The developer contacted Google to report the compromised app, which means that Google was also aware of this issue.
*   The developer also provided a copy of the tampered manifest file and the tampered APK file as evidence.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE ID CVE-2020-15165.
