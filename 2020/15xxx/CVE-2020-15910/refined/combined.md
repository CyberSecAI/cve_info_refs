N-CENTRAL SESSION HIJACK WRITEUP

PRESS INFORMATION

For more information regarding this report or any related data, Please contact CVE-2020-
15910@limenetworks.nl.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During a planned red teaming exercise internally at Lime Networks, The security specialist Maarten
van der Horst found two vulnerabilities in the Solarwinds N-Central RMM application. Both
vulnerabilities are used to compromise a logged on users’ account and bypass Multifactor
authentication. There are two CVEs assigned as both issues are exploitable using different methods.

Solarwinds N-Central is a Remote management and monitoring application that uses a cookie for
logon. Copying a part of this cookie, namely the “JSESSIONID” allows an attacker to logon to N-
central server from any location as long as that session has not been logged out by the actual user.
Copying this cookie does not invalidate a session and there are no further validation checks in place
to confirm that the user is the actual owner of this cookie.

This allows a bad actor to copy the cookie and circumvent login and multifactor authentication
prompts.

I would like to thank Solarwinds for working together with me / Lime Networks on solving the
problems, the fast response and showing that Solarwinds takes great care in making sure their
products are safe.

Lime Networks believes these issues to be ranked in the medium to high range, depending on all
other security factors.

TIMELINE

7-17-2020:

Found vulnerabilities in N-Central and reported them with a PoC to the Solarwinds
security team.

7-18-2020:

Received response from Solarwinds, informing us about an investigation.

7-22-2020:

Received update acknowledging the vulnerabilities and informing us there is a fix.

7-23-2020:

Requested CVE ID from MITRE.

7-23-2020:

CVE ID 2020-15909 and 2020-15910 acknowledged by MITRE.

7-24-2020:

Sent extra information to Solarwinds explaining the vulnerabilities. Issue in progress
internally at Solarwinds.

CVE-2020-15910: HTTPONLY ATTRIBUTE NOT SET IN THE JSESSIONID COOKIE.

Remote Exploitable:
User interaction required:

Resolved:

Yes
Yes. By visiting infected/prepared webpage

Yes. Version 12.3 HF2

N-Central version 12.3 GA and lower does not set the JSESSIONID attribute to HTTPOnly. This makes
it possible to influence the cookie with javascript. An attacker could send the user to a prepared
webpage or by influencing JavaScript to the extract the JESSIONID. This could then be forwarded to
the attacker. Maarten van der Horst has not made a POC for this, but the exploitability has been
confirmed by Solarwinds.

By not setting the HTTPOnly flag, XSS becomes easy to execute. Solarwinds fixed this issue in later
versions of N-Central on May 2020.

CVE-2020-15909: ATTACK ENGINEERS’ WORKSTATION AND STEAL COOKIE
DATABASE.

Remote Exploitable:
User interaction required:

Resolved:

Partially – Requires manual execution.
Yes.

Yes. Version 2020.1 HF2

CVE-2020-15909 requires user interaction or physical access.

The N-Central JSESSIONID cookie attribute is not checked against multiple sources such as source-
IP, MFA claim, etc. as long as the victim stays logged in within N-Central. To take advantage of
this, the cookie could be stolen and the JSESSIONID can be captured. On its own this is not a
surprising result; cookies in general are meant to be able to roam. The issue is that N-Central is a
highly privileged tool and the expectance is that session anomalies are detected and presented
with re-auth or a multi-factor prompt.

The JSESSION cookie can be used on the attackers’  workstation by browsing to the victim’s N-
Central server URL and replacing the JSESSIONID attribute value by the captured value. Expected
behavior would be to check this against a second source and enforce at least a reauthentication or
multi factor request as N-Central is a highly privileged service.

A PowerShell Proof on Concept has been included. This proof of concept shows it is trivial to hijack
the cookie and send this to a bad actor. In the example the Chrome database is used to extract the
cookie.

Wide range of automated monitoring (Windows, Linux, Mac), automatic monitor/device setup, and auto-deployment of service templates

**Manual effort required**
Templates for common server roles must be manually enabled, and whole-network monitoring is time-consuming

**Manual**
No automation of monitoring; monitors are mostly manually created, and network monitoring is not automatically applied

**Automatic but lacks functionality**
Monitoring supports multiple OSs and network devices, but breadth of monitoring functions is limited

Manageability

**Easy manageability and scalability**
Provides multiple ways to manage a large number of devices and scales as your business grows

**Limited scalability**
Can automate and scale across three servers, so it is less scalable for larger MSPs

**Managable**
Can scale a large number devices

**Manageable but less flexible**
Can scale up to a large number of devices, but with fewer available configurations

Patch management

**Patch It all**
Patch more, anywhere, anytime, and offline. Patch all bands including out-of-band. Rules and filtering allow for powerful automation

**In-band only**
Limited patch coverage that doesn't support out-of-band patches

**In-band only**
 Limited coverage with online patching only and no support for out-of-band patches

**In-band only**
Limited coverage with online patching only and no support for out-of-band patches

No-code automation

**No-code automation for all**
Automation made easy, with no-code automation and an intuitive drag-and-drop automation builder

**Might still require code**
Automation scripting engine might require training and scripting talent to create comprehensive policies

**Might still require code**
Basic automation designer that requires some level of coding expertise

**Code required**
No scripting designer–requires MSPs to design and script their own automation

Scripting engine

**V8 engine**
Robust automation out of the box, with 650+ ready-to-use, pre-scanned automation policies

**Pedal power**
Small list of out-of-the-box scripts available

**V6 engine**
Community automation exchange forum where you must mine their 600 listings of procedures and monitor sets

**V4 engine**
Catalog of 263 components built and maintained by Datto

Security

**Best-in-class security**
Integrates with industry leading SentinelOne EDR, Cove Data Protection, AV, DNS filtering, Email security, password management, and more

**Good security but not top of line**
Offers Connectwise MDR, Bitdefender and focussed on SOC as a service

**Basic security for basic protection**
Integrates with Bitdefender and Webroot

**Good security but not top of line**
Supports some integrations and also has a proprietary solution that isn’t on [2022 MiTRE ATT&CK Results](https://attackevals.mitre-engenuity.org/enterprise/participants?adversaries=wizard-spider-sandworm%2Ccarbanak-fin7%2Capt29%2Capt3)
