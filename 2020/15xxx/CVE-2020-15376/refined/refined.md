- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A weakness in the LDAP implementation within Brocade Fabric OS when configured in Virtual Fabric mode. Specifically, if an LDAP user is not associated with any groups, they can log in with "user" privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege assignment during LDAP authentication for users without group associations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote LDAP user can gain unauthorized access to the Brocade Fibre Channel SAN switch with limited "user" privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access via LDAP authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A valid LDAP user who is not associated with any groups, and network access to the Brocade switch. The attacker must authenticate via LDAP.
