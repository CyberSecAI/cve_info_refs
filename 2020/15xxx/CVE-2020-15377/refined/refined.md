- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A misconfiguration in the Webtools component of Brocade SANnav allows unauthenticated users to make requests to arbitrary hosts, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to misconfiguration in Webtools.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can use the SSRF vulnerability to make the target service send requests to internal or external servers or services that would otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated network requests to the vulnerable Webtools component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Brocade SANnav instance, no authentication is required.
