Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `CMSApplication::printApplication()` function in `cms/app/webapp/base/CMSApplication.class.php` directly printing HTML content without proper sanitization.
*   Specifically, when a requested page doesn't exist, the `$classPath` is returned directly. This path is then printed by `printApplication()`, enabling a reflected XSS attack.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `cms/app/webapp/inquiry/admin.php`. When `SOY2HTMLFactory::pageExists()` returns `false`, the code would return the `$classPath` directly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS issue. By crafting a malicious URL with a non-existent page path, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page rendered in the victim's browser.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `$classPath` before printing it, allowing for XSS injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The XSS vulnerability can lead to RCE. By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can potentially force a logged-in administrator to perform actions, such as editing files, thus achieving RCE.
*   **Content Modification:** An attacker can modify the content displayed on the affected page by injecting JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL with a non-existent page path to trigger the vulnerability. This URL is sent to the victim.
*   **Administrator Interaction:** The administrator needs to be logged into the CMS and then tricked into accessing the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the server but needs to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting the malicious link.
*   The attacker needs to know the general structure of the CMS URLs to target a non-existent page path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found by `@stypr` from Flatt Security Inc.
*   The vulnerability is present in SoyCMS versions 3.0.2 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in a pull request #13 which changed the code to return an error message instead of the path if the page does not exist
*   The provided content includes a link to a YouTube video demonstrating the exploit.

The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-15183. The fix was to change the behavior of the vulnerable code block in `cms/app/webapp/inquiry/admin.php` to return an error message.
```php
if(!SOY2HTMLFactory::pageExists($classPath)){
    return "Error";
}
```
