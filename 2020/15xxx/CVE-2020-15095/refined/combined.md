| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c0)  Guillaume GARDET   2020-06-08 15:56:50 UTC  ``` Since the switch to GCC10, nodejs8/10/12 fail on ReqWrapList test on aarch64. If I force the use of GCC9, it passes again.

I know, but this is completely unrelated. python is only used for the build system.  My plan is to debug understand what is the difference between nodejs14 and the older versions and IF any of the compiler flags actually affect this. I want to introduce the -fno-strict-aliasing flag to the build, just in case, but I don't have too much hope that is actually the solution. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c5)  Guillaume GARDET   2020-07-30 07:28:36 UTC  ``` A workaround is available at <https://github.com/AdamMajer/nodejs-packaging/pull/31>  Could you accept it, please?  Because this bug blocks some packages in Tumbleweed, such as Firefox. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c6)  Adam Majer   2020-08-14 11:24:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Guillaume GARDET from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c5)) > A workaround is available at > <https://github.com/AdamMajer/nodejs-packaging/pull/31> >  > Could you accept it, please?  > Because this bug blocks some packages in Tumbleweed, such as Firefox.  I've traced this to one source file in cctest that seems to require -fno-strict-aliasing flag passed to the compiler. Why Aarch64 is only affected platform is a little funny. I'll let our GCC experts take a look. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c7)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-08-14 11:50:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1172686) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/826661> Factory / nodejs12 ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c8)  Dominique Leuenberger   2020-08-20 11:56:18 UTC  ``` At least on the nodejs10 submission (where this bug is referenced) build fails on i586: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:nodejs/nodejs10](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel%3Alanguages%3Anodejs/nodejs10) ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c9)  Guillaume GARDET   2020-08-20 12:14:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dominique Leuenberger from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c8)) > At least on the nodejs10 submission (where this bug is referenced) build > fails on i586: > [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:nodejs/nodejs10](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel%3Alanguages%3Anodejs/nodejs10)  Same for armv7.

But yes, 32-only seems affected here.  What is happening here is that node is trying to allocate a buffer the size of the node executable. The size of the executable is 660M because of debug symbols. The buffer is allocated a few times.  The workaround is to strip symbols before starting unit tests which reduces the executable to 24M. RSS size of the test is then 250M.  I'll push the solution to Tumbleweed shortly. Closing the bug as fixed. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c12)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-08-21 16:10:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1172686) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/828544> Factory / nodejs10 ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1172686#c17)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-09-30 13:17:52 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:2800-1: An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

## v6.6.0 (2019-01-17):

### REFACTORING OUT npm-REGISTRY-CLIENT

Today is an auspicious day! This release marks the end of a massive internal
refactor to npm that means we finally got rid of the legacy
[`npm-registry-client`](https://npm.im/npm-registry-client) in favor of the
shiny, new, `window.fetch`-like
[`npm-registry-fetch`](https://npm.im/npm-registry-fetch).

Now, the installer had already done most of this work with the release of
`npm@5`, but it turns out *every other command* still used the legacy client.
This release updates all of those commands to use the new client, and while
we're at it, adds a few extra goodies:

* All OTP-requiring commands will now **prompt**. `--otp` is no longer required for `dist-tag`, `access`, et al.
* We're starting to integrate a new config system which will eventually get extracted into a standalone package.
* We now use [`libnpm`](https://npm.im/libnpm) for the API functionality of a lot of our commands! That means you can install a library if you want to write your own tooling around them.
* There's now an `npm org` command for managing users in your org.
* [`pacote`](https://npm.im/pacote) now consumes npm-style configurations, instead of its own naming for various config vars. This will make it easier to load npm configs using `libnpm.config` and hand them directly to `pacote`.

There's too many commits to list all of them here, so check out the PR if you're
curious about details:

### DEPENDENCY UPDATES

A very special dependency update event! Since the [release of
`node-gyp@3.8.0`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/pull/1521), an awkward
version conflict that was preventing `request` from begin flattened was
resolved. This means two things:

1. We've cut down the npm tarball size by another 200kb, to 4.6MB
2. `npm audit` now shows no vulnerabilities for npm itself!

Thanks, [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg)!

## v6.2.0 (2018-07-13):

In case you missed it, [we
moved!](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175587538995/announcing-npmcommunity). We
look forward to seeing future PRs landing in
[npm/cli](https://github.com/npm/cli) in the future, and we'll be chatting with
you all in [npm.community](https://npm.community). Go check it out!

This final release of `npm@6.2.0` includes a couple of features that weren't
quite ready on time but that we'd still like to include. Enjoy!

### FEATURES

* [`244b18380`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/244b18380ee55950b13c293722771130dbad70de)
  [#20554](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20554)
  Add support for tab-separated output for `npm audit` data with the
  `--parseable` flag.
  ([@luislobo](https://github.com/luislobo))
* [`7984206e2`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7984206e2f41b8d8361229cde88d68f0c96ed0b8)
  [#12697](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12697)
  Add new `sign-git-commit` config to control whether the git commit itself gets
  signed, or just the tag (which is the default).
  ([@tribou](https://github.com/tribou))

### FIXES

* [`4c32413a5`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/4c32413a5b42e18a34afb078cf00eed60f08e4ff)
  [#19418](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/19418)
  Do not use `SET` to fetch the env in git-bash or Cygwin.

### DEPENDENCY BUMPS

* [`d9b2712a6`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/d9b2712a670e5e78334e83f89a5ed49616f1f3d3)
  `request@2.81.0`: Downgraded to allow better deduplication. This does
  introduce a bunch of `hoek`-related audit reports, but they don't affect npm
  itself so we consider it safe. We'll upgrade `request` again once `node-gyp`
  unpins it.
  ([@simov](https://github.com/simov))
* [`2ac48f863`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/2ac48f863f90166b2bbf2021ed4cc04343d2503c)

  `cli-table3@0.5.0`: `cli-table2` is unmaintained and required `lodash`. With
  this dependency bump, we've removed `lodash` from our tree, which cut back
  tarball size by another 300kb.

### DEPENDENCY SHUFFLE!

We did some reshuffling and moving around of npm's own dependencies. This
significantly reduces the total bundle size of the npm pack, from 8MB to 4.8MB
for the distributed tarball! We also moved around what we actually commit to the
repo as far as devDeps go.

  When requesting the update of a direct dependency that was also a
  transitive dependency to a version incompatible with the transitive
  requirement and you had a lock-file but did not have a `node_modules`
  folder then npm would fail to provide a new copy of the transitive
  dependency, resulting in an invalid lock-file that could not self heal.

## v6.1.0-next.0 (2018-05-17):

Look at that! A feature bump! `npm@6` was super-exciting not just because it
used a bigger number than ever before, but also because it included a super
shiny new command: `npm audit`. Well, we've kept working on it since then and
have some really nice improvements for it. You can expect more of them, and the
occasional fix, in the next few releases as more users start playing with it and
we get more feedback about what y'all would like to see from something like
this.

I, for one, have started running it (and the new subcommand...) in all my
projects, and it's one of those things that I don't know how I ever functioned
-without- it! This will make a world of difference to so many people as far as
making the npm ecosystem a higher-quality, safer commons for all of us.

This is also a good time to remind y'all that we have a new [RFCs
repository](https://github.com/npm/rfcs), along with a new process for them.
This repo is open to anyone's RFCs, and has already received some great ideas
about where we can take the CLI (and, to a certain extent, the registry). It's a
great place to get feedback, and completely replaces feature requests in the
main repo, so we won't be accepting feature requests there at all anymore. Check
it out if you have something you'd like to suggest, or if you want to keep track
of what the future might look like!

### NEW FEATURE: `npm audit fix`

This is the biggie with this release! `npm audit fix` does exactly what it says
on the tin. It takes all the actionable reports from your `npm audit` and runs
the installs automatically for you, so you don't have to try to do all that
mechanical work yourself!

Note that by default, `npm audit fix` will stick to semver-compatible changes,
so you should be able to safely run it on most projects and carry on with your
day without having to track down what breaking changes were included. If you
want your (toplevel) dependencies to accept semver-major bumps as well, you can
use `npm audit fix --force` and it'll toss those in, as well. Since it's running
the npm installer under the hood, it also supports `--production` and
`--only=dev` flags, as well as things like `--dry-run`, `--json`, and
`--package-lock-only`, if you want more control over what it does.

Give it a whirl and tell us what you think! See `npm help audit` for full docs!

* [`3800a660d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3800a660d99ca45c0175061dbe087520db2f54b7)

  `npm-audit-report@1.2.1`:
  Overhaul audit install and detail output format. The new format is terser and
  fits more closely into the visual style of the CLI, while still providing you
  with the important bits of information you need. They also include a bit more
  detail on the footer about what actions you can take!
  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))

### NEW FEATURE: GIT DEPS AND `npm init <pkg>`!

Another exciting change that came with `npm@6` was the new `npm init` command
that allows for community-authored generators. That means you can, for example,
do `npm init react-app` and it'll one-off download, install, and run
[`create-react-app`](https://npm.im/create-react-app) for you, without requiring
or keeping around any global installs. That is, it basically just calls out to
[`npx`](https://npm.im/npx).

The first version of this command only really supported registry dependencies,
but now, [@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton) went ahead and extended this
feature so you can use hosted git dependencies, and their shorthands.

So go ahead and do `npm init facebook/create-react-app` and it'll grab the
package from the github repo now! Or you can use it with a private github
repository to maintain your organizational scaffolding tools or whatnot. ✨

Hey y'all! Here's another `npm@6` release -- with `node@10` around the corner,
this might well be the last prerelease before we tag `6.0.0`! There's two major
features included with this release, along with a few miscellaneous fixes and
changes.

### EXTENDED `npm init` SCAFFOLDING

Thanks to the wonderful efforts of [@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton) of
lodash fame, `npm init` can now be used to invoke custom scaffolding tools!

You can now do things like `npm init react-app` or `npm init esm` to scaffold an
npm package by running `create-react-app` and `create-esm`, respectively. This
also adds an `npm create` alias, to correspond to Yarn's `yarn create` feature,
which inspired this.

  Add an `npm init` feature that calls out to `npx` when invoked with positional
  arguments. ([@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton))

### DEPENDENCY AUDITING

This version of npm adds a new command, `npm audit`, which will run a security
audit of your project's dependency tree and notify you about any actions you may
need to take.

The registry-side services required for this command to work will be available
on the main npm registry in the coming weeks. Until then, you won't get much out
of trying to use this on the CLI.

As part of this change, the npm CLI now sends scrubbed and cryptographically
anonymized metadata about your dependency tree to your configured registry, to
allow notifying you about the existence of critical security flaws. For details
about how the CLI protects your privacy when it shares this metadata, see `npm help audit`, or [read the docs for `npm audit`
online](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/release-next/doc/cli/npm-audit.md). You
can disable this altogether by doing `npm config set audit false`, but will no
longer benefit from the service.

  [#20384](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20384)
  Add `from` field back into package-lock for git dependencies. This will give
  npm the information it needs to figure out whether git deps are valid,
  specially when running with legacy install metadata or in
  `--package-lock-only` mode when there's no `node_modules`. This should help
  remove a significant amount of git-related churn on the lock-file.

  [#20390](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20390)
  Fix a scenario where a git dependency had a comittish associated with it
  that was not a complete commitid. `npm` would never consider that entry
  in the `package.json` as matching the entry in the `package-lock.json` and
  this resulted in inappropriate pruning or reinstallation of git
  dependencies. This has been addressed in two ways, first, the addition of the
  `from` field as described in [#20384](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20384) means
  we can exactly match the `package.json`. Second, when that's missing (when working with
  older `package-lock.json` files), we assume that the match is ok. (If
  it's not, we'll fix it up when a real installation is done.)

## v6.0.0-0 (2018-03-23):

Sometimes major releases are a big splash, sometimes they're something
smaller. This is the latter kind. That said, we expect to keep this in
release candidate status until Node 10 ships at the end of April. There
will likely be a few more features for the 6.0.0 release line between now
and then. We do expect to have a bigger one later this year though, so keep
an eye out for `npm@7`!

### *BREAKING* AVOID DEPRECATED

When selecting versions to install, we now avoid deprecated versions if
possible. For example:

```
Module: example
Versions:
1.0.0
1.1.0
1.1.2
1.1.3 (deprecated)
1.2.0 (latest)

```

If you ask `npm` to install `example@~1.1.0`, `npm` will now give you `1.1.2`.

By contrast, if you installed `example@~1.1.3` then you'd get `1.1.3`, as
it's the only version that can match the range.

* [`78bebc0ce`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/78bebc0cedc4ce75c974c47b61791e6ca1ccfd7e)
  [#20151](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20151)
  Skip deprecated versions when possible.
  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))

### *BREAKING* UPDATE AND OUTDATED

When `npm install` is finding a version to install, it first checks to see
if the specifier you requested matches the `latest` tag. If it doesn't,
then it looks for the highest version that does. This means you can do
release candidates on tags other than `latest` and users won't see them
unless they ask for them. Promoting them is as easy as setting the `latest`
tag to point at them.

Historically `npm update` and `npm outdated` worked differently. They just
looked for the most recent thing that matched the semver range, disregarding
the `latest` tag. We're changing it to match `npm install`'s behavior.

* [`3aaa6ef42`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3aaa6ef427b7a34ebc49cd656e188b5befc22bae)
  Make update and outdated respect latest interaction with semver as install does.

  `npm-pick-manifest@2.1.0`
  ([@iarna](https://github.com/iarna))

### PLUS ONE SMALLER PATCH

Technically this is a bug fix, but the change in behavior is enough of an
edge case that I held off on bringing it in until a major version.

When we extract a binary and it starts with a shebang (or "hash bang"), that
is, something like:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node

```

If the file has Windows line endings we strip them off of the first line.
The reason for this is that shebangs are only used in Unix-like environments
and the files with them can't be run if the shebang has a Windows line ending.

Previously we converted ALL line endings from Windows to Unix. With this
patch we only convert the line with the shebang. (Node.js works just fine
with either set of line endings.)

  `bin-links@1.1.2`:
  Only rewrite the CR after a shebang (if any) when fixing up CR/LFs.

Node 7, which are no longer supported by the Node.js project.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-8189.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-8223.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-8201 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8201)

#### Description

Node.js < 12.18.4 and < 14.11 can be exploited to perform HTTP desync attacks and deliver malicious payloads to unsuspecting users. The payloads can be crafted by an attacker to hijack user sessions, poison cookies, perform clickjacking, and a multitude of other attacks depending on the architecture of the underlying system. The attack was possible due to a bug in processing of carrier-return symbols in the HTTP header names.
