Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15095:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content directly references CVE-2020-15095 and describes the vulnerability as an information exposure through log files in the npm CLI. This aligns with the official description of the CVE, which is about sensitive information leakage via logs.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The npm CLI prior to version 6.14.6 does not redact password values from URLs when these are printed to stdout or generated log files.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Information exposure: Passwords included in URLs are not redacted when npm CLI logs or outputs these URLs.
  - The CLI supports URLs like `<protocol>://[<user>[:<password>]@]<hostname>[:<port>][:][/]<path>`.
  - The password value is not redacted.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Exposure of sensitive information (passwords) which can be exploited by attackers.
   - Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to systems or resources by obtaining the leaked credentials.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - An attacker could obtain sensitive credentials from log files.
   - If an npm command with a password-embedded URL is executed and its output is saved or logged.
   - If an attacker has access to the output of npm commands that contains the vulnerable URLs.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - Access to log files where the npm CLI output is logged.
   - Ability to execute npm commands and capture output that contains URLs with embedded passwords.
   - No specific privileges are required other than having access to logs or command outputs.

**Additional Information (from the content):**

*   The vulnerability affects npm CLI versions prior to 6.14.6.
*   The fix involves redacting password values before they are logged or outputted.
*   The issue is resolved by a commit in the npm CLI repository that removes the authentication information from logs (`a9857b8f6869451ff058789c4631fadfde5bbcbc`).
*   Several Linux distributions and other products were affected and have been patched.
*   The vulnerability is present in nodejs 8, 10, and 12.
