  "CVE-2020-15210": {
    "Description": "In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a TFLite saved model uses the same tensor as both input and output of an operator, then, depending on the operator, we can observe a segmentation fault or just memory corruption.",
    "Root cause": "A TFLite model uses the same tensor as both input and output of an operator.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of shared input/output tensors"
    ],
    "Impact": "Segmentation fault or memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted TFLite model",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a malicious TFLite model to the vulnerable application."
