- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_mod_security.php` file of CentOS Web Panel. The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input in the `archivo` parameter before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation of the `archivo` parameter. This allows execution of arbitrary system commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected CentOS Web Panel installation.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to `ajax_mod_security.php` containing a malicious payload within the `archivo` parameter. Authentication is not required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability.
