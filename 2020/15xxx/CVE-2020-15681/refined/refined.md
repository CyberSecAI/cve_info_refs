Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how WebAssembly (WASM) threads handle shared stub tables for exported functions. When multiple WASM threads reference the same module and try to look up exported functions, they can potentially overwrite each other's entries in the shared stub table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to the shared stub table without proper synchronization leads to a race condition.
- **Unprotected Shared Resource:** The shared stub table is not protected against concurrent modification by multiple threads.
- **Potential Overwrite:** One WASM thread can overwrite another thread's entry in the stub table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** Overwriting stub table entries can lead to a crash when a thread attempts to use an overwritten entry. The crash is considered potentially exploitable, although the exploitability was not definitively confirmed.
-   **Memory Corruption:** Although not explicitly stated, the nature of the vulnerability suggests a high likelihood of memory corruption due to the overwrite of function pointers or other critical data in the stub table.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Multiple WASM Threads:** The primary attack vector is through the use of multiple WASM threads that are simultaneously trying to access and use functions exported from the same module.
-   **Concurrent Function Lookups:** Triggering concurrent lookups of exported functions from the same WASM module by different threads is necessary for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Create and Run WASM:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create and run WASM code that can utilize multiple threads.
-   **Control Over WASM Execution:**  The attacker needs to have a level of control over the WASM execution environment to trigger the race condition. This likely means they would need to be able to execute WASM code in the context of the vulnerable application (e.g. the Firefox browser).

**Additional Technical Details:**

-   **Lazy Stub Table:** The vulnerability occurs in the lazy stub table, which is used to optimize calls to exported WASM functions. When a function is called for the first time, a stub is created. The stub table is shared across instances of the same WASM module.
-   **`getExportedFunction` and `callExport`:** The `getExportedFunction` call can initialize an entry in the stub table to a sentinel value, and a later `callExport` replaces the entry with the actual compiled function.
-   **`cmpxchg` Fix:** The initial fix used a `cmpxchg` (compare-and-exchange) atomic operation to ensure that the stub table entry is initialized only once and prevents non-null entries from being overwritten, however this is technically racy because other accesses to the table are not atomic.
-   **Long-Term Fix:** A more comprehensive, long-term fix was planned to address the root cause of the race condition through proper locking mechanisms or using safe-for-races atomics.
-   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Firefox versions up to 81, and was fixed in Firefox 82.

In summary, CVE-2020-15681 is a moderate-severity vulnerability caused by a race condition when multiple WASM threads access shared stub tables, leading to potential crashes and possible exploitation. The fix involves ensuring that entries in the shared table are only initialized once using atomic operations.
