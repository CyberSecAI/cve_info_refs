Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15505:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the MobileIron Core & Connector software where user-provided input is deserialized using the Hessian format. This deserialization process is vulnerable and can be exploited by an attacker.
*   The vulnerable endpoint exists within a Tomcat Web Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the insecure deserialization of user-provided input in Hessian format. Attackers can manipulate this input to inject malicious code.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** The management interface, which exposes the vulnerable deserialization endpoint, is usually protected. However, the content indicates that it is possible to bypass Apache rewrite rules designed to block access to the Tomcat server. This bypass is achieved by exploiting inconsistencies between Apache and Tomcat's parsing logic, allowing access to the vulnerable service. Specifically, a URL path with ".;" is used to bypass access controls.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the deserialization flaw and bypassing access controls, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **System Takeover:** An attacker can gain full control of the MobileIron server.
*   **Internal Network Infiltration:** Once the MobileIron server is compromised, attackers can pivot to the internal network as observed in the Facebook case.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** Attackers can steal sensitive data, manipulate configurations, or install backdoors.
*   **Ransomware Deployment:** The content also notes that attackers are known to use MDM vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Exploiting Parser Logic:** Attackers send specially crafted HTTP requests, specifically using the ".;" sequence in the URL path, to bypass Apache rewrite rules and access the vulnerable Tomcat service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the MobileIron server, or specifically the exposed user enrollment interface at `https://mobileiron/mifs/services/` or the management interface, often at `https://mobileiron:8443/mics/services/`.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the deserialization vulnerability and the bypass technique. The provided PoCs on Github and elsewhere show that this information is available.
*   **Crafting Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious payload using the Hessian format and embed it in the HTTP request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects specific versions of MobileIron Core & Connector, Sentry, and Monitor and Reporting Database (RDB) as detailed in the provided content and the official CVE description.
*   Patches were released to address the vulnerability, and applying these patches is a critical mitigation step.
*   The vulnerability has been exploited by state-sponsored actors and other malicious actors.
*   The content includes a Suricata rule to detect the Apache rewrite rule bypass attempts:
