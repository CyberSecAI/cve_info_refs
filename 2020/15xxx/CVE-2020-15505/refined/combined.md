# MobileIron Security Updates Available

Last updated:
October 22, 2020

![](https://static.ivanti.com/sites/marketing/media/images/icons/icon-blog-author.svg)
[Ivanti](/blog/author/ivanti)

[Security](/blog/topics/security)

***\*This post originally appeared on the MobileIron blog prior to the acquisition in December 2020, when MobileIron became part of Ivanti.***

Since June 2020 when MobileIron published the patches to address the vulnerabilities below, we have engaged in ongoing proactive outreach to help customers secure their systems. That outreach has included calls from our account teams, regular targeted emails, and in-product notices. We currently estimate that between 90%-95% of all devices are now managed on patched/updated versions of our software. We continue to follow up with the remaining customers where we can determine that they have not yet patched or upgraded affected products.

**Summary:**

Recently, Orange Tsai from DEVCORE reported to MobileIron that he had identified vulnerabilities in MobileIron Core that could allow an attacker to execute remote exploits without authentication.

The MobileIron security and engineering team validated the reported vulnerabilities and extended the review to all supported MobileIron products to identify any related impacts. We developed and made available patches to address these vulnerabilities.

| **Issue** | **Description** | **CVE** | **CVSS v3 Score** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Remote Code Execution | A remote code execution vulnerability in MobileIron Core & Connector versions 10.3.0.3 and earlier, 10.4.0.0, 10.4.0.1, 10.4.0.2, 10.4.0.3, 10.5.1.0, 10.5.2.0 and 10.6.0.0; Sentry versions 9.7.2 and earlier, and 9.8.0; and Monitor and Reporting Database (RDB) version 2.0.0.1 and earlier that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors. | CVE-2020-15505 | 9.8 CRITICAL |
| Arbitrary File Reading | An arbitrary file reading vulnerability in MobileIron Core versions 10.3.0.3 and earlier, 10.4.0.0, 10.4.0.1, 10.4.0.2, 10.4.0.3, 10.5.1.0, 10.5.2.0 and 10.6.0.0 that allows remote attackers to read files on the system via unspecified vectors. | CVE-2020-15507 | 7.5 HIGH |
| Authentication Bypass | An authentication bypass vulnerability in MobileIron Core & Connector versions 10.3.0.3 and earlier, 10.4.0.0, 10.4.0.1, 10.4.0.2, 10.4.0.3, 10.5.1.0, 10.5.2.0 and 10.6.0.0 that allows remote attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms via unspecified vectors. | CVE-2020-15506 | 9.8 CRITICAL |

**Available Patches:**

* **MobileIron Core & Enterprise Connector**

  Apply one of the following patches (v10.3.0.4, v10.4.0.4, v10.5.1.1, v10.5.2.1, v10.6.0.1) or update to a later version.
* **MobileIron Sentry**

  Apply one of the following patches (v9.7.3, v9.8.1) or update to a later version.
* **MobileIron Monitor and Reporting Database (RDB)**

  Apply the following patch (v2.0.0.2) or update to a later version.
* **MobileIron Cloud**

  Status: Has been updated.

Patches for all impacted products were made available on June 15, 2020. Customers can access all patches at: [https://help.mobileiron.com/s/article-detail-page?Id=kA12T000000g065SAA](https://help.mobileiron.com/redirect.aspx?url=https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Bulletin)

**Recommended Mitigation:**

MobileIron strongly recommends that customers apply these patches and any security updates as soon as possible.

2022 MSP Threat Report

This report was created by the ConnectWise Cyber Research Unit (CRU)—a dedicated team of ConnectWise threat hunters that identifies new vulnerabilities.

[Get my eBook >>](/resources/ebook-2022-msp-threat-report)

##### How did a security researcher infiltrate Facebook’s internal network?

Through the MDM server.

What’s that? An MDM server, or Mobile Device Management server, is used to manage employee mobile devices, install apps, certificates, modify settings, and wipe phones from a central location. MDM servers require employee phones to be able to reach the server for updates, meaning they risk being exposed over the internet.

In a time when more employees are working from home, organizations are looking for remote management products. An MDM’s ability to push code onto corporate devices makes them an excellent target for allowing threat actors to gain a foothold.

On April 3, 2020, Cheng-Da Tsai, also as known as Orange Tsai, the principal security researcher of DEVCORE and member of the CHROOT security group from Taiwan, reported three severe vulnerabilities in MobileIron’s MDM. MobileIron released product updates and disclosed the vulnerabilities publicly on June 15.

On September 12, Tsai published a write-up describing how they infiltrated Facebook’s internal network as part of Facebook’s bug bounty program. Tsai leveraged MobileIron vulnerability CVE-2020-15505 to access Facebook’s MobileIron MDM server and pivot to the internal network around July 2.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGTLIIOb14A) is a video demo. Wait until the end to see the non-interactive shell demonstrated.

Facebook must be looking at what failed in its patch management efforts. Perhaps, the patch management team didn’t realize the bug’s criticality, and it wasn’t correctly prioritized. Or, maybe, they didn’t realize the criticality of the asset. Either way, Facebook failed to patch the 9.8 CVSS score vulnerability before it was exploited.

The National Security Agency [disclosed](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/-1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF) that MobileIron CVE-2020-15505 was one of the top 25 vulnerabilities exploited by Chinese state-sponsored hackers since the vulnerability was disclosed.

Facebook is lucky that Tsai got to them first.

As defenders, we should have an impact analysis for different assets we manage. Your MDM is a critical asset. It should be a high priority for your patch management team. You should also monitor the logs and network-related traffic for threats. Hook up your MDM to your SIEM and monitor it with an IDS to detect threats.

In Perch’s 2020 Threat Report, we warned about attackers using software vulnerabilities in remote management servers to deploy ransomware. Attacking the MDM fits perfectly into this vector.

##### CVE-2020-15505 vulnerability details

Based on the vulnerability description from MobileIron, we don’t have much to go on:

*A remote code execution vulnerability in MobileIron Core & Connector versions 10.3.0.3 and earlier, 10.4.0.0, 10.4.0.1, 10.4.0.2, 10.4.0.3, 10.5.1.0, 10.5.2.0 and 10.6.0.0; and Sentry versions 9.7.2 and earlier, and 9.8.0; and Monitor and Reporting Database (RDB) version 2.0.0.1 and earlier that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.*

This leaves a blue teamer with lots of questions about how to detect both exploit attempts and successful exploitation.

After the bug bounty write-up, we got a few more details. The vulnerability exists in a Tomcat Web Service that deserializes user input with Hessian format. The endpoint is located on both:

* User enrollment interface - https://mobileiron/mifs/services/
* Management interface - https://mobileiron:8443/mics/services/

The deserialization can only be reached through the management interface, but most enterprises won’t have their management interface exposed to the internet.

A way to bypass the controls and access the vulnerable endpoint is required. So how are they blocking it, and how can we get around?

To block access to the Tomcat server, MobileIron relied on Apache rewrite rules:

```
RewriteRule ^/mifs/services/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}:8443/mifs/services/$1 [R=307,L]
RewriteRule ^/mifs/services [F]
```

Tsai has previously published research on [breaking parser logic](https://blog.orange.tw/2018/08/how-i-chained-4-bugs-features-into-rce-on-amazon.html) [in 2015](https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges#blackbox) and at [Black Hat USA 2018](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Orange-Tsai-Breaking-Parser-Logic-Take-Your-Path-Normalization-Off-And-Pop-0days-Out-2.pdf). This technique leverages inconsistencies between Apache and Tomcat to bypass the ACL control and access the vulnerable service. A POST HTTP request to a URL, like below, could be used to bypass controls:

* https://mobileiron/mifs/.;/services/LogService

##### Flock vision

After Tsai’s bug bounty write-up, red team security researchers used the new details to create [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/httpvoid/CVE-Reverse/tree/master/CVE-2020-15505) (PoC) exploits for CVE-2020-15505. The proof of concept was first published on 9/13 with a final commit on 9/21.

![cve-2020-15505-image-1.png](/globalassets/media/blog/2020/cve-2020-15505-image-1.png)

Tsai’s write-up and the PoCs also allowed the blue team to write threat detection signatures and uncover the secrets that only attackers knew, balancing the field.

Perch’s first sighting of recon and exploitation for CVE-2020-15505 occurred on Sep 24, 2020, just 3 days after the final PoC commits were added to GitHub. Perch has evidence that multiple threat actors are exploiting these bugs to take over critical assets and infiltrate internal networks.

![cve-2020-15505-image-2.png](/globalassets/media/blog/2020/cve-2020-15505-image-2.png)

The first round of attacks was launched from an Azure instance and used the Nuclei scanning tool to recon possible victims.

![cve-2020-15505-image-3.png](/globalassets/media/blog/2020/cve-2020-15505-image-3.png)

Perch automates the deployment of Indicators of Compromise from free and paid threat intelligence providers on behalf of licensed customers. On October 12, Emerging Threats added a signature to detect exploit attempts against this vulnerability. If you’re running your own IDS, look at adding this signature:

```
alert http any any -> [$HOME_NET,$HTTP_SERVERS] any (msg:"ET EXPLOIT Possible MobileIron RCE Attempt Inbound (CVE-2020-15505)"; flow:established,to_server; content:"|2f 2e 3b 2f|"; http_uri; fast_pattern; reference:url,blog.orange.tw/2020/09/how-i-hacked-facebook-gain-mobileiron-mdm-rce.html; reference:cve,2020-15505; classtype:attempted-admin; sid:2030997; rev:2; metadata:created_at 2020_10_12, cve CVE_2020_15505, former_category EXPLOIT, signature_severity Major, updated_at 2020_10_12;)
```

This signature is really focused on detecting the Apache RuleRewrite bypass and not the actual exploit of the attack. But, as noted, it’s unlikely that companies are leaving the management interface exposed. So, this rule is not covering attempts against directly exposed management interfaces.

MobileIron estimates its clients at 20,000. However, based on internet scans reviewed by Perch, only 5,000 patched and unpatched MobileIron servers were found, with more than 60 percent of them being patched.

If you’re using an MDM, make sure it’s current on patches. What are you doing to monitor your MDM? Contact Perch today for help in monitoring your MDM.

National Security Agency | Cybersecurity Advisory

Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities

One of the greatest threats to U.S. National Security Systems (NSS), the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and
Department of Defense (DoD) information networks is Chinese state-sponsored malicious cyber activity. These networks
often undergo a full array of tactics and techniques used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors to exploit computer
networks of interest that hold sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information. Since these
techniques include exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities, it is critical that network defenders prioritize patching and
mitigation efforts.

The same process for planning the exploitation of a computer network by any sophisticated cyber actor is used by
Chinese state-sponsored hackers. They often first identify a target, gather technical information on the target, identify any
vulnerabilities associated with the target, develop or re-use an exploit for those vulnerabilities, and then launch their
exploitation operation.

This advisory provides Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) known to be recently leveraged, or scanned-for, by
Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors to enable successful hacking operations against a multitude of victim networks.
Most of the vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited to gain initial access to victim networks using products that are
directly accessible from the Internet and act as gateways to internal networks. The majority of the products are either for
remote access (T1133)1 or for external web services (T1190), and should be prioritized for immediate patching. While
some vulnerabilities have specific additional mitigations below, the following mitigations generally apply:

  Keep systems and products updated and patched as soon as possible after patches are released.2
  Expect that data stolen or modified (including credentials, accounts, and software) before the device was patched

will not be alleviated by patching, making password changes and reviews of accounts a good practice.

  Disable external management capabilities and set up an out-of-band management network.3
  Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge and disable them in device configurations.4


Isolate Internet-facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to reduce the exposure of the internal
network.5

  Enable robust logging of Internet-facing services and monitor the logs for signs of compromise.6

Detailed Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

The following is a list of CVEs being actively used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, a description of the
vulnerability, and the recommended mitigations. (NOTE: The following list of CVEs is non-exhaustive of what is available
or perhaps used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, but is a list of those being operationalized by China.)

NSA is aware that National Security Systems, Defense Industrial Base, and Department of Defense networks are
consistently scanned, targeted, and exploited by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors. NSA recommends that critical
system owners consider these actions a priority, in order to mitigate the loss of sensitive information that could impact
U.S. policies, strategies, plans, and competitive advantage. Additionally, due to the various systems and networks that
could be impacted by the information in this product outside of these sectors, NSA recommends that the CVEs above be
prioritized for action by all network defenders.
