Admittedly, this is a trivial ambition, however, as lame as it sounds, it is one that has kept me enthused to sleep, eat and breathe ‘cyber’ for the better part of my […]

The mission was simple: try to gain unauthorised physical access to the clients headquarters, and if successful, identify as much sensitive data as possible, without touching the network or computers. Our two-man team was assembled and consisted of myself and a colleague, who’ll I’ll only refer to as “Jellybean”. We had 3 days. This is a recounting […]

Operational Security, or OpSec, is a military term that describes the process of identifying and protecting sensitive information, that if otherwise uncovered, would give your adversary an advantage. A familiar example of practicing OpSec in the real-world would be protecting your card pin when using it. Applied to the world of cybersecurity, common OpSec examples […]

When anybody says the word “Phishing” the mind jumps to email-based attacks. We all know the kind; aimed at either enticing you to click the link, open the attachment, or follow the instruction. But this is not the only type of Phishing you need to be aware of. Another type of phishing attack can be […]

A quick post on how to hinder automated attacks against CloudFlare protected sites by implementing rate limits. The ability to perform an automated attack against a web application is a huge bonus for an attacker. If you remove this capability, an attackers ability to perform attacks like brute-forcing account passwords, enumerating files and folders, and […]

  [16th Feb 2020](https://blog.divisionzero.co/2020/02/16/server-side-template-injection-in-lodash-js-analysis/)

Earlier today I read a Tweet regarding a security weakness in the Lodash Javascript utility library. The Tweet explained that Lodash is vulnerable to Server-side Template Injection and that it can be exploited to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the application server. I wanted to see the exploit in action for myself, so quickly […]

The mission was simple: try to gain unauthorised physical access to the clients headquarters, and if successful, identify as much sensitive data as possible, without touching the network or computers.
