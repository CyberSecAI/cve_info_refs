Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of file names returned by a file picker application within Firefox for Android. When a malicious file picker app is selected, it can provide a crafted file path using path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).  Firefox uses this unsanitized path to create a temporary file, which allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files within the application's internal directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the path traversal issue that allows writing to directories outside the intended target.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to validate and sanitize file paths provided by external sources.
*   **Use of Untrusted Data:** Firefox uses the `_display_name` from the content provider without proper validation, treating it as a safe filename.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file inside the private directory of Firefox.
*   **Tampering of Settings:** Attackers can modify important configuration files such as `profile.ini`, which, as shown in the provided bug report, can be used to redirect the profile location to a different app's directory, potentially allowing control over user data.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** By tampering with Firefox internal files, a malicious app could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data or manipulate app behavior.
*   **Application Compromise:** Overwriting core files can lead to complete compromise of the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File Picker Application:** The primary attack vector requires an attacker to have a malicious file picker application installed on the user's Android device.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must interact with a webpage that triggers the file picker and select the attacker's malicious application as the picker.
*   **`content://` URI:** The malicious app must provide the crafted path via a `content://` URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Android App Development:** The attacker must be capable of developing and publishing a malicious file picker application.
*   **App Installation:** The malicious app must be installed on the victim's device.
*   **Webpage Hosting:** The attacker needs to host or control a webpage capable of triggering the file upload functionality.
*   **Understanding of Firefox Internal File Structure:** The attacker must know which files to target for maximum impact.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code was found in `FilePickerResultHandler` class:
    ```java
    String fileName = cursor.getString(0);
    //...
    tempDir = FileUtils.createTempDir(cacheDir, "tmp_");
    File file = new File(tempDir, fileName);
    ```
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `fileName` before creating the temporary file. This is achieved by extracting only the last component of the path, removing any traversal sequences (e.g., `/../../../../../../../../../data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/profiles.ini` becomes just `profiles.ini`).
*   The vulnerability affected Firefox for Android and Fennec browsers.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) app (`mozillatraverse`) was created to demonstrate the issue.

The provided content also indicates that the fix for this vulnerability was included in Firefox ESR 68.11, and a security advisory was issued.
