Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper escaping of user-supplied input when transforming MyCode (a custom BBCode implementation) into HTML for visual preview in the MyBB visual editor. Specifically, the code responsible for processing `[align]`, `[size]`, `[quote]`, and `[font]` MyCode tags doesn't consistently use functions to convert special characters to HTML entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DOM-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS, meaning the malicious payload is not directly injected into the HTML source of the page on the server-side. Instead, the browser's DOM (Document Object Model) is manipulated via Javascript based on the malicious user input.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data when converting MyCode to HTML within the visual editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, such as posting messages, changing settings, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.
*   **Data exfiltration** - Ability to leak sensitive data

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted MyCode:** The attack vector involves injecting specially crafted MyCode into the visual editor.
*   **GET/POST Parameters:** The vulnerability can be exploited through GET or POST parameters where message content is pre-filled (e.g., when composing a new message or replying to a private message) with malicious MyCode.
*   **Stored Messages:** If a user replies to or quotes a previously saved message containing malicious MyCode, the vulnerable code will trigger.
*   **Visual Editor Activation:** The visual editor needs to be enabled, either globally or for an individual user account, to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Post Malicious Content:** The attacker must be able to post messages or content in MyBB that can contain MyCode.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to access a page where the visual editor is active and processes the malicious MyCode.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attack can be carried out by any user with posting privileges, although the impact may depend on the victim's privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   The server-side parser is not affected; the vulnerability lies in the client-side code used by the visual editor.
*   The vulnerability is present in MyBB versions prior to 1.8.24.
*   MyBB 1.8.24 fixes the issue by adding proper escaping of special characters in the `jscripts/bbcodes_sceditor.js` file.
*   Workarounds include disabling the visual editor globally or per-user account.
*   The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2020-15139

**Summary of changes made in the patch:**

The patch modifies `jscripts/bbcodes_sceditor.js` to use `$.sceditor.escapeEntities()` when processing `align`, `size`, `quote`, and `font` MyCode tags. This function converts HTML special characters, mitigating the XSS vulnerability.
