Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15083:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way error messages related to file uploads were handled in the PrestaShop product page. Specifically, the error message, including the filename and the error description, was being appended to the HTML content using `append()`, rather than being treated as plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By crafting a malicious filename, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the error message. Because the error message is appended to the HTML, it gets rendered and the malicious JavaScript would execute within the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- If a user, while using the PrestaShop admin interface, attempts to upload a file with a malicious filename, the injected JavaScript could be executed in the context of the user's session. This could lead to various malicious actions:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing of sensitive information.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    - Altering the content or functionality of the web page.

**Attack vectors:**

- A remote attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious file with a filename containing XSS payload. Then, they need to get a user with access to the PrestaShop admin panel to upload the malicious file via the product image upload functionality on the admin interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to craft a file with a malicious filename.
- The attacker needs a user to upload the malicious file using the vulnerable file upload function on the admin interface.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated; this is a reflected XSS, which means the payload is sent as part of the request.

**Additional details:**

- The provided content includes the commit fixing the vulnerability. It shows that the `append()` function was replaced with the `.text()` function to handle the error message. This change escapes any HTML characters in the file name and the error message, preventing XSS attacks.
- The affected versions are PrestaShop versions > 1.7.0.0, and the patched version is 1.7.6.6.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
