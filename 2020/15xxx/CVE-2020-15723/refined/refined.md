Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-15723:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how 360 Total Security (specifically, the main program) calls `GameChrome.exe`. This improper handling leads to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **DLL Hijacking:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to DLL hijacking. By placing a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by `GameChrome.exe` instead of the legitimate one, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to elevate their privileges on the local system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code of their choosing.
- **Bypass of HIPS:** DLL hijacking also bypasses the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) that is part of the 360 Total Security suite.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack must be performed on the target system.
- **DLL Hijacking:** The specific vector is DLL hijacking which is a well-known technique where the attacker uses a malicious dll instead of a legitimate one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the targeted system to place the malicious DLL where it can be loaded.
- **Knowledge of DLL Loading Mechanism:** The attacker needs to know how DLL loading works in order to successfully hijack a specific DLL and make `GameChrome.exe` load it instead of the legitimate one.

**Affected Versions:**

- 360 Total Security version 12.1.0.1004 and earlier versions.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by a security researcher named "Windows no bugs".
- The vulnerability has been fully patched.
- The vulnerability has not been exploited in the wild.
