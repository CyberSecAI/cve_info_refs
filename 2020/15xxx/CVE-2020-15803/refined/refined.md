Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-15803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the URL widget of Zabbix, allowing the injection of malicious code. Specifically, the vulnerability resides within how Zabbix handles user-supplied URLs for the URL widget, allowing for the insertion of arbitrary HTML elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within the URL widget settings. This code is stored and executed each time a user views the dashboard containing the affected widget.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided URLs, leading to the injection of HTML elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Once the malicious JavaScript is injected and executed within a user's browser, the attacker can potentially perform actions within the user's session such as:
  - Steal session cookies.
  - Modify displayed content or configuration settings.
  - Perform administrative tasks on behalf of the user if the user has the required privileges.
- **Data Modification and Theft:** The injected code could potentially be used to steal data from the application or modify existing data.
- **Phishing:** An attacker could potentially use the injected script to redirect a user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Widget Injection:** An authenticated user, with the ability to create or edit dashboard elements, can inject malicious code by crafting a URL with embedded JavaScript.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would likely need to use social engineering to lure other users into viewing the maliciously crafted dashboards.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account with privileges to create or modify dashboards or widgets.
- **Knowledge of Zabbix Interface:** The attacker must understand the Zabbix interface enough to know where to insert the malicious code and how it will be interpreted.

**Additional Notes:**

- Multiple sources confirm that the vulnerability exists in Zabbix versions prior to 3.0.32rc1, 4.x before 4.0.22rc1, 4.1.x through 4.4.x before 4.4.10rc1, and 5.x before 5.0.2rc1.
- Patches have been released for various Linux distributions including Fedora, Debian and SUSE to address this issue.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input to the URL widget and adding a sandbox parameter to the iFrame to prevent execution of embedded JavaScript code.
-  The severity of the vulnerability is described as 'moderate' by some sources.
