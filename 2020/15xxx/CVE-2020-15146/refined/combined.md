# Remote Code Execution in OptionsParser while using request parameters inside expression language

Critical

[pamil](/pamil)
published
GHSA-h6m7-j4h3-9rf5
Aug 18, 2020

## Package

composer

sylius/resource-bundle
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=1.3.13 || >=1.4.0 <=1.4.6 || >=1.5.0 <=1.5.1 || >=1.6.0 <=1.6.3

## Patched versions

1.3.14, 1.4.7, 1.5.2, 1.6.4

## Description

### Impact

Request parameters injected inside an expression evaluated by `symfony/expression-language` package haven't been sanitized properly. This allows the attacker to access any public service by manipulating that request parameter, allowing for Remote Code Execution.

The vulnerable versions include: `<=1.3.13 || >=1.4.0 <=1.4.6 || >=1.5.0 <=1.5.1 || >=1.6.0 <=1.6.3`.

### Example

```
sylius_grid:
    grids:
        foo:
            fields:
                bar:
                    options:
                        baz: "expr:service('sylius.repository.product').find($id)"
```

In this case, `$id` can be prepared in a way that calls other services.

If you visit `/route?id="~service('doctrine').getManager().getConnection().executeQuery("DELETE * FROM TABLE")~"`, it will result in a following expression `expr:service('repository').find(""~service('doctrine').getManager().getConnection().executeQuery("DELETE * FROM TABLE")~"")`, which will execute a query on the currently connected database.

To find a vulnerability in your application, look for any routing definition that uses request parameters inside expression language.

### Patches

This issue has been patched for versions 1.3.14, 1.4.7, 1.5.2 and 1.6.4. Versions prior to 1.3 were not patched.

### Workarounds

The fix requires adding `addslashes` in `OptionsParser::parseOptionExpression` to sanitize user input before evaluating it using the expression language.

```
- return is_string($variable) ? sprintf('"%s"', $variable) : $variable;
+ return is_string($variable) ? sprintf('"%s"', addslashes($variable)) : $variable;
```
