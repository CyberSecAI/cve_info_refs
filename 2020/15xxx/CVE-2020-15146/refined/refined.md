Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the improper sanitization of request parameters injected into expressions evaluated by the `symfony/expression-language` package. User-supplied input from request parameters is directly used within expressions, without proper escaping, leading to the injection of malicious code or commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the possibility of RCE. By crafting a malicious request parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Expression Language Injection:** The vulnerability occurs because unsanitized input is passed to the expression language evaluator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute any code they want on the server by manipulating the request parameters.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Using expression language injection, attackers can modify, delete, or extract sensitive data from the database. In the example provided, an attacker could delete data from the database.
*   **Access to Internal Services:** Attackers can gain access to any public service through the expression language. This allows further exploitation by using the accessible services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:** The primary attack vector is via HTTP request parameters. An attacker injects malicious code or commands within the request parameters.
*  **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL, specifically the query string, to introduce malicious parameters, and these parameters are used to construct expressions to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of Application:** The attacker must be able to identify routes that make use of request parameters within the expression language and construct the appropriate malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is specifically triggered within the `OptionsParser::parseOptionExpression` function. The fix involves adding `addslashes` to sanitize user input before it's evaluated by the expression language.

The vulnerable code:

```
return is_string($variable) ? sprintf('"%s"', $variable) : $variable;
```

The patched code:

```
return is_string($variable) ? sprintf('"%s"', addslashes($variable)) : $variable;
```

The example in the advisory shows how an attacker could inject code through an `$id` parameter to execute a database query:

```
sylius_grid:
    grids:
        foo:
            fields:
                bar:
                    options:
                        baz: "expr:service('sylius.repository.product').find($id)"
```
Visiting the route with a crafted `id` parameter like `/route?id="~service('doctrine').getManager().getConnection().executeQuery("DELETE * FROM TABLE")~"` results in the following expression being executed, which deletes data from the database:
`expr:service('repository').find(""~service('doctrine').getManager().getConnection().executeQuery("DELETE * FROM TABLE")~"")`
