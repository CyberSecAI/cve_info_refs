Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize or escape backticks (`\``) in user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries. Specifically, the `isNameQuoted()` function was not sufficient in preventing SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities. By injecting malicious SQL code through backticks, an attacker can manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive information from the database, including passwords, reset tokens, and personal details.
*   **Data Modification:** It could be possible to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious SQL code containing backticks into input fields that are subsequently used to construct SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application that will be used in a SQL query and have that input include a backtick. It can be assumed this is generally an authenticated user with access to data fields where this could be exploited.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in GLPI versions >= 0.68.
*   The patch is available in version 9.5.2.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by SchneiderSec.
*   The fix involved removing the ability to use SQL expressions as strings in criterion values within SQL iterators and replacing it with `QueryExpression`.
