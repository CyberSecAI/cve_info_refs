Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the server-side processing of XML metadata files uploaded when configuring Gradle Enterprise to integrate with a SAML identity provider. Specifically, the server improperly handles XML External Entities (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is the presence of XXE injection, allowing the server to dereference external entities defined within the uploaded XML metadata file. This gives an attacker control over what the server fetches, potentially from internal systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Successful exploitation of the XXE injection vulnerability leads to Server-Side Request Forgery. An attacker can cause the server to make requests to internal resources, external resources, or other servers, which can disclose sensitive information or interact with other parts of the network.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** If the server is made to request internal system resources, the attacker can gain access to data that should not be publicly available.
- **Other potential impacts:** By controlling the server's requests, an attacker could attempt to trigger other vulnerabilities on internal services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SAML Metadata File Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted XML metadata file during the configuration of a SAML identity provider within the Gradle Enterprise application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative access to the Gradle Enterprise application to upload the malicious XML metadata file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Gradle Enterprise versions 2018.5 through 2020.2.4.
- The issue is mitigated by upgrading to Gradle Enterprise version 2020.2.5 or later.
