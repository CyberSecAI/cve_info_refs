{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `sanitized_join` function in `xhu.py` did not properly handle `..` sequences in paths, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper path sanitization",
      "Directory traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could read arbitrary files with `.data` suffixes and accompanying `.meta` JSON files on the server. In scenarios where multiple instances of the application run on the same server (shared hosting), an attacker could access data from other instances. This could also circumvent authentication or other traffic limitations. If an attacker possesses the HMAC key, they could write files outside the designated data directory, potentially including symlinks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTTP GET/PUT requests with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the path.",
        "Local access to create malicious .meta files and .data symlinks.",
         "Exploiting the application across multiple instances on shared hosting."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the server",
        "Knowledge of the server's directory structure (for shared-hosting scenarios)",
        "Possession of the HMAC key (for writing files outside the data directory)"
    ]
