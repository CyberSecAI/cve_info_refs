# Local privilege elevation vulnerability in default admin installation

Low

[johnstevenson](/johnstevenson)
published
GHSA-wgrx-r3qv-332c
Aug 14, 2020

## Package

composer

Composer-Setup.exe
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 6.0.0

## Patched versions

6.0.0

## Description

### Impact

If the developer's computer is shared with other users, a local attacker may be able to exploit the following scenarios.

1. A local regular user may modify the existing `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin\composer.bat` in order to get elevated command execution when composer is run by an administrator.
2. A local regular user may create a specially crafted dll in the `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin` folder in order to get Local System privileges. See: [https://itm4n.github.io/windows-server-netman-dll-hijacking](https://itm4n.github.io/windows-server-netman-dll-hijacking/).
3. If the directory of the php.exe selected by the user is not in the system path, it is added without checking that it is admin secured, as per Microsoft guidelines. See: [https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2018/04/04/triaging-a-dll-planting-vulnerability](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2018/04/04/triaging-a-dll-planting-vulnerability/).

### Workarounds

Change `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin` user permissions to read and execute only.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15145

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
