Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inadequate permission management during the installation of Composer on Windows. Specifically, the installer creates the `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin` directory which contains the `composer.bat` file and other binaries and does not properly secure this directory, leading to potential privilege escalation. The installer also adds the directory of the php.exe selected by the user to the system path without checking if it is admin secured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Permissions:** The `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin` directory is created with write permissions for standard users. This allows a malicious local user to modify the `composer.bat` file to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges when an administrator uses the Composer.
2.  **DLL Hijacking:** A local attacker can create a malicious DLL within the same directory, which may be loaded instead of legitimate DLLs, thus achieving Local System privileges due to how the Netman service handles DLL loading.
3. **Insecure Path Addition:** The installer adds the selected php.exe path to the system path without verifying the path's security, leading to a potential DLL planting vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, non-admin user can gain elevated privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By modifying `composer.bat` or leveraging DLL hijacking, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `composer` or Local System.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise by a local user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:**  An attacker must have local access to the affected machine.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker modifies or adds files to the `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a regular user account on the target Windows system.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker must be able to write files to `C:\ProgramData\ComposerSetup\bin` which is achievable due to the default permissions set.

**Additional details:**

* The provided content includes the fix for the vulnerability. The commit `ca9f1435d368e3377e82d60ef0c7b795afa9f804` introduces changes to `src/composer.iss` and `src/scripts/acls.bat` to lock down the permissions on the bin directory. The fix removes inheritance, removes creator owner and builtin users' permissions and then grants read-execute permissions to builtin users.
*   The content confirms that the vulnerability affects versions prior to 6.0.0 and is patched in version 6.0.0.

**Severity**
* Low
