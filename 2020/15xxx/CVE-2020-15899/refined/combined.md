## Summary
On Saturday June 6, 2020, the Grin security team was made aware of a critical vulnerability in the proof of work verification code. Discovered by Grin core team member and Proof-of-Work (PoW) developer John Tromp, the vulnerability, had it been exploited, would have lead to solution speedups of 1000x and more.
The vulnerability was fixed in v4.0.0-rc.1 as part of the mandatory upgrade ahead of the [scheduled hard fork on July 16, 2020](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-v4-0-0-network-upgrade-hard-fork-3-july-2020/7001) (HF3). This document provides details on the vulnerability, the fix, and what measures were taken to protect Grin users.
\*\*It has been verified that this vulnerability was never exploited.\*\*
An oversight in the implementation of the Cuckaroom29 proof of work led the number of nodes in a valid graph to be restricted to half, `2^28`, rather than the expected `2^29`. As is shown below, this could lead to solution speedups in the range of 1000x or more. Even as the network no longer would use the PoW algorithm in question from HF3 and onwards, it was still vulnerable to an attack, as the speedup achieved would allow an attacker to mine from the beginning of the previous hard fork (HF2) chain and make it valid according to the longest chain rule. The fix was obscured in a refactoring of the PoW codebase that was merged and released as part of the first v4.0.0 release candidate of the Grin node.
This has been assigned [CVE-2020-15899](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15899).
## Recommended actions
\* \*\*None.\*\* Nodes and wallets that are running v4.0.0 or greater are not affected by this vulnerability.
## Background
### Disclosure
As per [Grin's security process document](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/SECURITY.md#bilateral-responsible-disclosure-agreements), the project does not currently have any established bilateral disclosure agreements. In line with our security policy, no disclosure has therefore been made to third parties prior to to this publication.
A review of the Grin++ codebase led us to determine it was not vulnerable as it was derived from the correct implementation in the Cuckoo Cycle repository at https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo/blob/master/src/cuckaroom/cuckaroom.hpp .
As the consensus rules of the network requires running software that includes a fix, no additional action is required by mining pools, wallet software providers, or exchanges.
### Timeline of events
\* Jun 06 2020: The Grin security team is notified of the vulnerability, an encrypted chat group is created with John Tromp.
\* It is confirmed that the vulnerability has not yet been exploited.
\* A fix is ready to go once a roll-out plan is agreed.
\* Monitor nodes are set up that are configured to detect an attack on the network and send alerts on keybase and local consoles.
\* It is determined that the current Cuckarooz verifier suffers the same bug, and that this should be addressed immediately in a refactoring / code simplification PR.
\* Jun 07: Cuckarooz bug fix disguised as a simplification is introduced in PR https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3343. This leaves the bug in Cuckaroom still intact in production.
\* Jun 10: Emergency action plan agreed in the event of an exploit being detected in production by the monitoring nodes.
\* Jun 17: Agreement on what approach to take as Plan A. The fix will be targeted for HF3. @tromp will sneak the fix into a refactoring of all verify code shortly prior to the final 4.0.0 binaries being released.
\* Jun 24: Cuckaroom bug fix disguised in a larger refactoring of all verify code is introduced in PR https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3365.
\* Jun 26: @antiochp and @quentinlesceller raise questions in private about the PR and its timing and are made aware that there is an underlying security related aspect behind the PR, but not the details. The PR is merged and the fix is included in v4.0.0-rc.1 which is released the same day.
\* Jul 16: At block height 786,240, the network successfully upgrades to v4.0.0 and consensus rules that fix the Cuckaroom vulnerability.
\* Jul 24: Grin core team notified that a fixed critical vulnerability in Grin's PoW will be disclosed imminently.
\* Jul 27: Disclosure of the vulnerability through the publication of this document.
## Technical details
The vulnerability resided in the implementation of Cuckaroom29, the third
instance of Grin's ASIC-resistant secondary PoW. All instances belong to the
Cuckoo Cycle family of PoWs, in which the puzzle is a random graph and the
solution is a proper (non-self-intersecting) cycle of length 42, which we'll
call a 42-cycle.
The Cuckaroom29 graphs have 2^29 edges and 2^29 nodes, which results in an
expected number of 42-cycles of approximately 1/42. The implementation was
provided in [Pull Request #3136](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3136)
in file `core/src/pow/cuckaroom.rs`. Edge endpoints are generated by computing
a siphash function on the edge index, and masking the low and high 32-bit words
of the 64-bit result with a nodemask.
This file was produced by modifying a copy of the corresponding file for the
previous instance `core/src/pow/cuckarood.rs`. However, whereas Cuckarood29
graphs are bipartite, with the 2^29 nodes split into two groups of 2^28 nodes,
Cuckaroom graphs are monopartite with a single group of 2^29 nodes. By
forgetting to adjust the setting `let nodemask = self.params.edge\_mask >> 1;`
to the appropriate `let nodemask = self.params.edge\_mask;`, the implementation
effectively restricted the Cuckaroom29 graph to only 2^28 nodes. The oversight
was only noticed when preparing the fourth instance, Cuckarooz29, which doubled
the number of nodes to 2^30.
This effectively constitutes a different PoW puzzle `HalfCuckaroom29`.
Almost every Cuckaroom29 42-cycle is also a HalfCuckaroom29 42-cycle
(identifying nodes that only differ in bit 28). The "almost" reflects the tiny
chance that node identification causes an unwanted cycle self-intersection. The
reverse however fails catastrophically, as a HalfCuckaroom29 graph has an
expected number of about 100B (100 billion) 42-cycles.
For the 6 months during which it was active, miners have been solving
HalfCuckaroom29 as if it were Cuckaroom29. This can be seen as taking a
HalfCuckaroom29 graph, splitting each of its `2^28` nodes into two, and making
incident edges choose randomly among the two, to end up with a Cuckaroom29
graph. They could have instead thrown away half of the `2^29` edges in the
Cuckaroom29 graph, to end up with a Cuckaroom28 graph. That gives a speedup of
2x.
We now propose a solving method that should achieve much larger speedups, of well over 1000x.
It builds an efficiently indexable representation of the graph in which each node
has room to store up to 4 incoming edges and up to 4 outgoing edges. Then it
picks a single node `v` that has at least 4 incoming and 4 outgoing edges. It
can be shown that the expected number of 42-cycles going through `v` is at
least `2^14`. From there it builds, layer by layer, a tree of incoming paths
each of length 21, and a tree of outgoing paths each of length 21. Denote the
set of nodes found to have 21-paths to `v` as `U`, and the nodes reached by
21-path from `v` as `W`. With the average in- an out-degree equal to 2, we
expect `U` and `W` to be of size at least `2^21`, which is `1/128` of all nodes.
We then expect U and W to intersect in at least `2^21/128 = 2^14` nodes. These
common nodes can be efficiently enumerated as can their paths to and from `v`,
each forming a 42-cycle. These must still be filtered for self-intersection,
but the vast majority will survive. The total effort to generate these roughly
`2^14` 42-cycles through `v` is proportional to size of the double trees, or
about `2^24`. If none of the 42-cycles meets the network difficulty, then the
process can be repeated with a different `v`.
## Fix necessity
It might appear at first, that with Cuckaroom29 no longer being active after
HF3, the bug would no longer be exploitable, and would not need to be fixed.
But the vulnerability would remain. An attacker, equipped with a vastly more
efficient HalfCuckaroom29 solver, could begin to rewrite history all the way from
HardFork2, setting initial timestamps just 1 second apart in order to drive up
difficulty, afterwards setting them 60 seconds apart to stabilize difficulty,
all the time while only mining the secondary PoW. The secondary scale would then be
adjusted downward making secondary blocks more difficult, but would soon reach
its minimum value of 13. Once the rewritten history would reach the height of
HF3, its cumulative difficulty would be far higher than the real chain and a
6-month deep re-org would occur.
## Fix details
To obscure the fixed nodemask setting in Cuckaroom29, a [large refactoring](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3365) of the PoW code was undertaken which, amongst various other changes, adds a `node\_mask` field to the `CuckooParams` struct and sets it in the constructor from an additional `node\_bits` parameter:
```rust
pub fn new(edge\_bits: u8, node\_bits: u8, proof\_size: usize) -> Result {
let num\_edges = 1u64 << edge\_bits;
let edge\_mask = num\_edges - 1;
let num\_nodes = 1u64 << node\_bits;
let node\_mask = num\_nodes - 1;
```
For the actual fix, the Cuckaroom29 struct is created as `let params = CuckooParams::new(edge\_bits, edge\_bits, proof\_size)?;`, which passes `edge\_bits=29` for parameter `node\_bits`.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions.

If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

## Summary

On Saturday June 6, 2020, the Grin security team was made aware of a critical vulnerability in the proof of work verification code. Discovered by Grin core team member and Proof-of-Work (PoW) developer John Tromp, the vulnerability, had it been exploited, would have lead to solution speedups of 1000x and more.

The vulnerability was fixed in v4.0.0-rc.1 as part of the mandatory upgrade ahead of the [scheduled hard fork on July 16, 2020](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-v4-0-0-network-upgrade-hard-fork-3-july-2020/7001) (HF3). This document provides details on the vulnerability, the fix, and what measures were taken to protect Grin users.

**It has been verified that this vulnerability was never exploited.**

An oversight in the implementation of the Cuckaroom29 proof of work led the number of nodes in a valid graph to be restricted to half, `2^28`, rather than the expected `2^29`. As is shown below, this could lead to solution speedups in the range of 1000x or more. Even as the network no longer would use the PoW algorithm in question from HF3 and onwards, it was still vulnerable to an attack, as the speedup achieved would allow an attacker to mine from the beginning of the previous hard fork (HF2) chain and make it valid according to the longest chain rule. The fix was obscured in a refactoring of the PoW codebase that was merged and released as part of the first v4.0.0 release candidate of the Grin node.

This has been assigned [CVE-2020-15899](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15899).

## Recommended actions

* **None.** Nodes and wallets that are running v4.0.0 or greater are not affected by this vulnerability.

## Background

### Disclosure

As per [Grin's security process document](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/SECURITY.md#bilateral-responsible-disclosure-agreements), the project does not currently have any established bilateral disclosure agreements. In line with our security policy, no disclosure has therefore been made to third parties prior to to this publication.

A review of the Grin++ codebase led us to determine it was not vulnerable as it was derived from the correct implementation in the Cuckoo Cycle repository at <https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo/blob/master/src/cuckaroom/cuckaroom.hpp> .

As the consensus rules of the network requires running software that includes a fix, no additional action is required by mining pools, wallet software providers, or exchanges.

### Timeline of events

* Jun 06 2020: The Grin security team is notified of the vulnerability, an encrypted chat group is created with John Tromp.
  + It is confirmed that the vulnerability has not yet been exploited.
  + A fix is ready to go once a roll-out plan is agreed.
  + Monitor nodes are set up that are configured to detect an attack on the network and send alerts on keybase and local consoles.
  + It is determined that the current Cuckarooz verifier suffers the same bug, and that this should be addressed immediately in a refactoring / code simplification PR.
* Jun 07: Cuckarooz bug fix disguised as a simplification is introduced in PR [mimblewimble/grin#3343](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3343). This leaves the bug in Cuckaroom still intact in production.
* Jun 10: Emergency action plan agreed in the event of an exploit being detected in production by the monitoring nodes.
* Jun 17: Agreement on what approach to take as Plan A. The fix will be targeted for HF3. @tromp will sneak the fix into a refactoring of all verify code shortly prior to the final 4.0.0 binaries being released.
* Jun 24: Cuckaroom bug fix disguised in a larger refactoring of all verify code is introduced in PR [mimblewimble/grin#3365](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3365).
* Jun 26: @antiochp and @quentinlesceller raise questions in private about the PR and its timing and are made aware that there is an underlying security related aspect behind the PR, but not the details. The PR is merged and the fix is included in v4.0.0-rc.1 which is released the same day.
* Jul 16: At block height 786,240, the network successfully upgrades to v4.0.0 and consensus rules that fix the Cuckaroom vulnerability.
* Jul 24: Grin core team notified that a fixed critical vulnerability in Grin's PoW will be disclosed imminently.
* Jul 27: Disclosure of the vulnerability through the publication of this document.

## Technical details

The vulnerability resided in the implementation of Cuckaroom29, the third
instance of Grin's ASIC-resistant secondary PoW. All instances belong to the
Cuckoo Cycle family of PoWs, in which the puzzle is a random graph and the
solution is a proper (non-self-intersecting) cycle of length 42, which we'll
call a 42-cycle.

The Cuckaroom29 graphs have 2^29 edges and 2^29 nodes, which results in an
expected number of 42-cycles of approximately 1/42. The implementation was
provided in [Pull Request #3136](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3136)
in file `core/src/pow/cuckaroom.rs`. Edge endpoints are generated by computing
a siphash function on the edge index, and masking the low and high 32-bit words
of the 64-bit result with a nodemask.

This file was produced by modifying a copy of the corresponding file for the
previous instance `core/src/pow/cuckarood.rs`. However, whereas Cuckarood29
graphs are bipartite, with the 2^29 nodes split into two groups of 2^28 nodes,
Cuckaroom graphs are monopartite with a single group of 2^29 nodes. By
forgetting to adjust the setting `let nodemask = self.params.edge_mask >> 1;`
to the appropriate `let nodemask = self.params.edge_mask;`, the implementation
effectively restricted the Cuckaroom29 graph to only 2^28 nodes. The oversight
was only noticed when preparing the fourth instance, Cuckarooz29, which doubled
the number of nodes to 2^30.

This effectively constitutes a different PoW puzzle `HalfCuckaroom29`.

Almost every Cuckaroom29 42-cycle is also a HalfCuckaroom29 42-cycle
(identifying nodes that only differ in bit 28). The "almost" reflects the tiny
chance that node identification causes an unwanted cycle self-intersection. The
reverse however fails catastrophically, as a HalfCuckaroom29 graph has an
expected number of about 100B (100 billion) 42-cycles.

For the 6 months during which it was active, miners have been solving
HalfCuckaroom29 as if it were Cuckaroom29. This can be seen as taking a
HalfCuckaroom29 graph, splitting each of its `2^28` nodes into two, and making
incident edges choose randomly among the two, to end up with a Cuckaroom29
graph. They could have instead thrown away half of the `2^29` edges in the
Cuckaroom29 graph, to end up with a Cuckaroom28 graph. That gives a speedup of
2x.

We now propose a solving method that should achieve much larger speedups, of well over 1000x.
It builds an efficiently indexable representation of the graph in which each node
has room to store up to 4 incoming edges and up to 4 outgoing edges. Then it
picks a single node `v` that has at least 4 incoming and 4 outgoing edges. It
can be shown that the expected number of 42-cycles going through `v` is at
least `2^14`. From there it builds, layer by layer, a tree of incoming paths
each of length 21, and a tree of outgoing paths each of length 21. Denote the
set of nodes found to have 21-paths to `v` as `U`, and the nodes reached by
21-path from `v` as `W`. With the average in- an out-degree equal to 2, we
expect `U` and `W` to be of size at least `2^21`, which is `1/128` of all nodes.
We then expect U and W to intersect in at least `2^21/128 = 2^14` nodes. These
common nodes can be efficiently enumerated as can their paths to and from `v`,
each forming a 42-cycle. These must still be filtered for self-intersection,
but the vast majority will survive. The total effort to generate these roughly
`2^14` 42-cycles through `v` is proportional to size of the double trees, or
about `2^24`. If none of the 42-cycles meets the network difficulty, then the
process can be repeated with a different `v`.

## Fix necessity

It might appear at first, that with Cuckaroom29 no longer being active after
HF3, the bug would no longer be exploitable, and would not need to be fixed.
But the vulnerability would remain. An attacker, equipped with a vastly more
efficient HalfCuckaroom29 solver, could begin to rewrite history all the way from
HardFork2, setting initial timestamps just 1 second apart in order to drive up
difficulty, afterwards setting them 60 seconds apart to stabilize difficulty,
all the time while only mining the secondary PoW. The secondary scale would then be
adjusted downward making secondary blocks more difficult, but would soon reach
its minimum value of 13. Once the rewritten history would reach the height of
HF3, its cumulative difficulty would be far higher than the real chain and a
6-month deep re-org would occur.

## Fix details

To obscure the fixed nodemask setting in Cuckaroom29, a [large refactoring](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3365) of the PoW code was undertaken which, amongst various other changes, adds a `node_mask` field to the `CuckooParams` struct and sets it in the constructor from an additional `node_bits` parameter:

```
    pub fn new(edge_bits: u8, node_bits: u8, proof_size: usize) -> Result<CuckooParams, Error> {
        let num_edges = 1u64 << edge_bits;
        let edge_mask = num_edges - 1;
        let num_nodes = 1u64 << node_bits;
        let node_mask = num_nodes - 1;
```

For the actual fix, the Cuckaroom29 struct is created as `let params = CuckooParams::new(edge_bits, edge_bits, proof_size)?;`, which passes `edge_bits=29` for parameter `node_bits`.
