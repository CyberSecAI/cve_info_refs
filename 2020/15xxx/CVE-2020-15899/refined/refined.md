```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An oversight in the implementation of the Cuckaroom29 proof of work algorithm led to an incorrect node mask, effectively restricting the graph to 2^28 nodes instead of the intended 2^29.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect implementation of the Cuckaroom29 PoW algorithm.",
       "Use of an incorrect nodemask value in graph construction.",
       "Failure to properly adapt code from a previous, similar implementation."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability would have allowed an attacker to achieve solution speedups of 1000x or more. An attacker could have rewritten the blockchain history from HardFork2 to HardFork3 by quickly creating blocks with the flawed PoW and then performing a deep reorg, invalidating the current blockchain.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation of the flawed Cuckaroom29 PoW implementation to mine blocks faster than the rest of the network.",
       "Performing a blockchain reorganisation by generating a longer chain with the flawed PoW."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be capable of implementing an optimized solver for the 'HalfCuckaroom29' variant of the PoW, which was made possible by the vulnerability. The attacker would also need to be able to generate a significant number of blocks to outperform the main network."
