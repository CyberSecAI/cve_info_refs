- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The authentication protocol between a client and a PLC via port 102/tcp (ISO-TSAP) insufficiently protects the transmitted password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain valid PLC credentials by intercepting network traffic. This could allow further unauthorized access and control of the PLC.
- **Attack vectors:** Network traffic interception on port 102/tcp (ISO-TSAP).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the affected PLC.
