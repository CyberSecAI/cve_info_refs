• Apply cell protection concept: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-

security

• For SIMATIC S7-CPU 410 CPUs: Activate Field Interface Security in PCS 7 V9.0, and use a

CP443-1 Adv. to communicate with ES/OS

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the Siemens SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous
control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries
worldwide.

Products in the SIMATIC S7-400 CPU family have been designed for process control in industrial
environments. They are used worldwide, e.g. in the automotive industry, mechanical equipment manu-
facture, warehousing systems, building engineering, steel industry, power generation and distribution,
pharmaceuticals, food and beverages industry, or chemical industry.

SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop ﬂoor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15791

The authentication protocol between a client and a PLC via port 102/tcp (ISO-TSAP) insufﬁciently
protects the transmitted password. This could allow an attacker that is able to intercept the network
trafﬁc to obtain valid PLC credentials.
