Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-controlled data used in the iTop console breadcrumb. By modifying the browser's local storage, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are then rendered in the breadcrumb.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability exists because the injected script is stored in local storage and then rendered in the browser, affecting any user accessing the compromised application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they use the iTop application. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Account compromise
    - Data theft
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Defacement of the iTop application

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Browser local storage modification:** An attacker manipulates the browser's local storage associated with the iTop application to inject the malicious script.
- **Breadcrumb display:** The iTop application's breadcrumb feature renders the attacker-controlled data without proper sanitization or encoding, leading to the execution of the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the local storage of the victim's browser, which could potentially involve:
    - Direct access to the victim's machine/browser if using local storage
    - Alternatively, a separate XSS vulnerability (on another part of the application) could be used by an attacker to modify local storage
    - Social engineering attacks to lure victims into malicious sites that exploit this issue

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in iTop versions prior to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
- The fix involves sanitizing or encoding the data used in the breadcrumb.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by Cyblex Technologies.
