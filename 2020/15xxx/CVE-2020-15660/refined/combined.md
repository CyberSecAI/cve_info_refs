Subject: Browser-mediated attacks on WebDriver servers

Several browser-mediated attacks on WebDriver servers:

* GeckoDriver CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-15660);
* GeckoDriver DNS-rebinding vulnerability (CVE-2021-4138);
* Chromedriver localhost-bound same-site/cross-origin request forgery
vulnerability;
* Selenium server/Grid CSRF vulnerability;
* Selenium server/Grid DNS-rebinding vulnerability.

In all cases this could be used to trigger arbitrary code execution.

GeckoDriver CSRF vulnerability
==============================

This is CVE-2020-15660. Fixed in GeckoDriver v0.27.0.

GeckoDriver DNS-rebinding vulnerability
=======================================

This is CVE-2021-4138. Fixed in GeckoDriver v0.30.0.

Chromedriver localhost-bound same-site/cross-origin request forgery
===================================================================

A XSS on another localhost-bound service could be exploited to trigger
arbitrary code execution.

Reference: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1100097>

Selenium server/Grid CSRF vulnerability
=======================================

A CVE-ID has been requested from MITRE.

This is fixed in SeleniumServer 4.

# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your account on GitHub as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

## 0.27.0 (2020-07-27, `7b8c4f32cdde`)

### Security Fixes

* [CVE-2020-15660](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jxv7-gvxq-248q "CVE-2020-15660")

  + Added additional checks on the `Content-Type` header for `POST` requests to disallow `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` and `text/plain`.
  + Added checking of the `Origin` header for `POST` requests.
  + The version number of Firefox is now checked when establishing a session.

### Known problems

* *macOS 10.15 (Catalina):*

  Due to the requirement from Apple that all programs must be notarized, geckodriver will not work on Catalina if you manually download it through another notarized program, such as Firefox.

  Whilst we are working on a repackaging fix for this problem, you can find more details on how to work around this issue in the [macOS notarization](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/geckodriver/Notarization.html) section of the documentation.
* *Android:*

  Marionette will only be enabled in GeckoView based applications when the

  Firefox preference `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` is set to `True` via

  [`moz:firefoxOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities/firefoxOptions). This will be fixed in the Firefox 90 release for Android.

  In some cases geckodriver could crash due to a stack overflow when handling

  certain device errors.

### Added

* To set environment variables for the launched Firefox for Android, it is now possible to add an `env` object on `moz:firefoxOptions` (note: this is not supported for Firefox Desktop)
* Support for print-to-PDF

  The newly standardised WebDriver [Print] endpoint provides a way to render pages to a paginated PDF representation. This endpoint is supported by geckodriver when using Firefox version ≥78.
* Support for same-site cookies

  Cookies can now be set with a `same-site` parameter, and the value of that parameter will be returned when cookies are retrieved. Requires Firefox version ≥79. Thanks to [Peter Major](https://github.com/aldaris) for the patch.

### Fixed

* *Android:*

  + Firefox running on Android devices can now be controlled from a Windows host.
  + Setups with multiple connected Android devices are now supported.
  + Improved cleanup of configuration files. This prevents crashes if the application is started manually after launching it through geckodriver.
* Windows and Linux binaries are again statically linked.
