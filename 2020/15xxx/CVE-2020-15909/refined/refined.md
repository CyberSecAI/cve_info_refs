Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The N-Central application does not properly validate the `JSESSIONID` cookie against multiple sources such as source IP or MFA claims. This allows an attacker to use a stolen session cookie from a different location and bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of sufficient validation of the `JSESSIONID` cookie.
- The `JSESSIONID` cookie can be used from a different location, which goes against the expected behavior for a highly privileged tool.
- No secondary checks or re-authentication is enforced when a `JSESSIONID` cookie is used from a new location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass login and multifactor authentication.
- Full access to an N-Central server by hijacking a legitimate user session, potentially gaining highly privileged access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is stealing the `JSESSIONID` cookie of a logged-in user.
- This can be achieved using a PowerShell script that extracts the cookie from the Chrome browser's database (as demonstrated in the provided proof-of-concept), or through other means.
- Once stolen, the attacker replaces their own `JSESSIONID` cookie with the stolen one and is logged in as the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have some form of access to the victim's machine (physical or remote) to extract the `JSESSIONID` cookie.
- The attacker needs to be able to browse to the victim's N-Central server.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate their own `JSESSIONID` cookie value when browsing to the N-Central server.
- No network-level access is required if the attacker has already acquired the cookie.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content is more descriptive than the basic CVE description, offering details about the vulnerable component, attack method, and impact.
- The vulnerability is described as partially resolved, requiring manual execution by the attacker, meaning it's not fully automated but is still a high-risk issue due to the ease of exploitation.
- The included PoC script uses Chrome's database to extract the cookie but also mentions other methods to exfiltrate the cookie.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 2020.1 HF2.
