SSA-436520: XSS and CSRF Vulnerabilities in Polarion Subversion
Webclient

SUMMARY

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found in the subversion webclient of Polarion. In
addition, the webclient doesn’t have any cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection. An attacker could
inject client side script to induce the victim to issue an HTTP request that would lead to a state changing
operation. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures as there are currently no ﬁxes available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

Polarion Subversion Webclient:
All versions

The tool is considered shareware, distributed “as
is” and there will not be a ﬁx as it is no longer
supported

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open unknown links while working on Polarion Subversion webclient

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Polarion WebClient for SVN, one of several free Subversion tools from Polarion Software, is a SVN client
that enables Subversion users to work with SVN repositories using a web browser.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15788

The Polarion subversion web application does not ﬁlter user input in a way that prevents Cross-Site
Scripting.

If a user is enticed into passing specially crafted, malicious input to the web client (e.g. by clicking on
a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript), then JavaScript code can be returned and may then be
executed by the user’s client.

Various actions could be triggered by running malicious JavaScript code.

CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags
in a Web Page (Basic XSS)

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15789

The web interface could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is
tricked into accessing a malicious link.

Successful exploitation requires user interaction by a legitimate user, who must be authenticated to
the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface
that the legitimate user is allowed to perform. This could allow the attacker to read or modify contents
of the web application.
