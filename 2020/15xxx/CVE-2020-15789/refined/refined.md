- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of Polarion Subversion Webclient lacks CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could trigger actions via the web interface that the legitimate user is allowed to perform, potentially allowing the attacker to read or modify the contents of the web application.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious link that an unsuspecting authenticated user is tricked into accessing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a legitimate, authenticated user into accessing a malicious link.
