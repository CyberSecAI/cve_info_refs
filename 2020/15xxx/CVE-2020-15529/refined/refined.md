The provided content describes multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the GOG Galaxy client, and includes CVE-2020-15529.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GOG Galaxy client service runs as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" and interacts with the client to perform tasks like game installation, updates, and uninstallation. Several files and folders within the GOG Galaxy installation directory have weak permissions allowing modification by regular users. This, combined with how the client executes certain operations, allows for privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Writable Game Installation Folder:** Regular users can modify the game installation directory ("Games" folder).
2.  **Writable Temporary Script Interpreter:** The temporary file `scriptinterpreter.tmp` (later `scriptinterpreter.exe`) is created during game installations and is located in a user-writable folder, and is later executed by the privileged service.
3.  **Insecure Execution of Games:** The client launches games via command line arguments that can be manipulated.
4.  **Insecure Uninstaller:** The game uninstaller located in the game folder can be replaced.
5.  **Opportunistic Lock (Oplock) Exploitation:** The file `scriptinterpreter.exe`, although downloaded every time it's executed, can be replaced using oplocks during the download process, before it's executed by the privileged service.
6.  **Writable Service Executable:** The service executable `GalaxyCommunication.exe` can be replaced after achieving elevated privileges through the other vulnerabilities.
7.  **Insecure Autostart Registry Entry:** The autostart registry entry for GOG Galaxy can be modified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to complete control of the affected system, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Evil Game:** Replace the game executable with a malicious one and launch it via the GOG Galaxy client.
2. **Evil Uninstall:** Replace the game uninstaller with a malicious one, which will then be executed elevated when the user uninstalls the game.
3.  **Evil Repair/Install:** Replace `scriptinterpreter.exe` with a malicious version using oplocks during game repair/installation.
4.  **Evil Service:** Replace the `GalaxyCommunication.exe` service executable with a malicious one, which will then be executed with SYSTEM privileges when the service is started.
5.  **Evil Autostart:** Modify the autostart entry to execute a malicious command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify files in the GOG Galaxy installation directories.
- For the oplock exploit, the attacker must be able to set an oplock on `winsta.dll`.
- The attacker can be a standard user without administrative privileges.
