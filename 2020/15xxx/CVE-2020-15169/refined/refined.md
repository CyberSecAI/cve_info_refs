Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-15169:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Rails' `t` and `translate` helpers handle default values for missing translation keys. Specifically, when an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default value for a missing translation key that is either named `html` or ends with `_html`, the string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core weakness is the failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.
- Improper HTML escaping: The `t` and `translate` helpers are not correctly escaping HTML-unsafe strings when they are used as default values for specific translation keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable web application. This could allow attackers to:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Deface web pages.
    - Redirect users to malicious sites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-controlled input that is passed as a default value to the `t` or `translate` helpers. This could be achieved by manipulating URL parameters, form data, or any other input mechanism that the application uses.
- The attacker needs to craft an HTML-unsafe string that contains malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control, at least partially, the default value passed to the `t` or `translate` helpers in a vulnerable Rails application.
- No special privileges are needed, just the ability to influence the input used in the translation helpers.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Rails prior to the patched versions.
- The patched versions are 6.0.3.3 and 5.2.4.4.
- Workarounds include manually escaping default translations with the `html_escape` helper (aliased as `h`).
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.
- The issue is present in the `actionview` component of the Rails framework.
- Patches are available for the `5-2-stable` and `6-0-stable` branches of Rails on GitHub.
