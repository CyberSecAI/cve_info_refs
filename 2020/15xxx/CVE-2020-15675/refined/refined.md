Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs when processing surfaces in WebGL. The lifetime of a `BorrowedSourceSurface` could outlive the `PresistentBufferProvider` it relies on, leading to a dangling pointer. This happens due to a WebGL refactor for out-of-process compositing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: A raw pointer (`mReturnTo` in `CanvasRenderer.cpp`) is used to access the `PresistentBufferProvider` after it has been freed.
- Dangling pointer: The `BorrowedSourceSurface` holds a raw pointer to a resource that may be released before the surface is destroyed.
- Memory corruption: Accessing the freed memory can lead to memory corruption and potentially a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High Impact:** The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to run arbitrary code. The provided crash data shows memory corruption, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering the use-after-free condition: An attacker needs to construct a scenario where the `BorrowedSourceSurface` outlives the `PresistentBufferProvider`. This is likely achieved through a crafted WebGL scene.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the use-after-free condition, likely via a malicious webpage using WebGL.
- Ability to control the lifetime of `BorrowedSourceSurface` and `PresistentBufferProvider` objects via the WebGL API.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug was introduced by a WebGL refactoring (bug 1632249) for out-of-process compositing.
- The crash was observed on multiple operating systems, including Linux and Windows.
-  The vulnerability affects Firefox versions 79 and later but was fixed in Firefox 81 and 82.
