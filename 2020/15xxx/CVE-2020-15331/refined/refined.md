The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15331.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from hardcoded secrets within the `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` configuration file. These secrets are used for secure communications between the appliance and the 'Cloud' management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded `APP_KEY` and `OAUTH_SECRET_KEY` are used for secure communications with the cloud.
- The configuration file `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` is world-readable, allowing any user to extract these secrets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the device or these hardcoded secrets can:
- Impersonate the device.
- Intercept and decrypt communications to the 'Cloud'.
- Potentially manipulate or control the device through the 'Cloud' management interface.
- Achieve unauthorized access to cloud services linked with the affected appliance

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing the configuration file `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` on a compromised device.
- Exploiting backdoors APIs to extract the secrets.
- Decrypting the secret `account_id` value from the ZODB interface which can be used to get access_key_id and secret_access_key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the device or a method to obtain the content of the `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` file.
- Alternatively, the attacker can use one of the multiple backdoors or vulnerabilities to gain access to the device and the file or directly extract the secrets from the ZODB interface.
