- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of the `type` parameter in `ajax_list_accounts.php` before using it to construct SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive information disclosure in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can send malicious requests to `ajax_list_accounts.php` with a crafted `type` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, meaning that the attacker can be unauthenticated.
