Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15958

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** vulnerability due to missing authorization checks combined with the storage of sensitive files within the web root. The application does not properly restrict access to files stored in the web server's document root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  Direct access to files stored within the web root is possible by knowing the file path.
*   **Missing Authorization:**  The application fails to properly authorize requests for files, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive data.
*   **Predictable File Paths and Names:** The application uses a predictable folder structure (e.g., `/files/upload/<id>/`, `/files/backups/`) and predictable/guessable filenames (e.g. `backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip`), which further exacerbates the IDOR vulnerability, making it easier for an attacker to target sensitive files.
*  **Storage of Sensitive Data in Web Root:** The application stores sensitive data such as backups (which may include database dumps, configurations with passwords and uploaded files) within the web server's document root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files such as:
    *   Customer data (orders, invoices, personal information)
    *   Employee data (resumes)
    *   System backups (containing database, configurations, passwords, and attachments)
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposure of system backups could lead to full system compromise due to the presence of database credentials, potentially leading to data manipulation or further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP requests** to the affected file paths without authentication. An attacker would need to know or guess the location and filename of the targeted files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to authenticate to the application.
*   **Knowledge or Guessing of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the file paths, including folder structure, filenames, especially for sensitive files such as backups.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in 1CRM versions <= 8.6.7.
*   The advisory mentions a `download.php` script, intended for secure file downloads, but the vulnerability lies in direct access to files not handled by that script.
*   The advisory recommends storing sensitive files outside the web root, implementing a secure download mechanism, using random file names, and encrypting backup files. It also recommends securing directories with `.htaccess` for Apache servers and similar configurations for other web servers like NGINX or IIS.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-219 (Storage of File with Sensitive Data Under Web Root).
