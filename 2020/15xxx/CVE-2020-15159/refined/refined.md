{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and validation in the ThemeFilesController.php and UploaderFilesController.php components, which allows for arbitrary file uploads and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE) through arbitrary file upload"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve XSS and RCE. XSS can be achieved by injecting malicious code through the content management or theme editing interfaces. RCE can be achieved by uploading and executing arbitrary files (like PHP scripts).",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vectors include the file upload functionality within ThemeFilesController.php and UploaderFilesController.php. An authenticated administrator must be logged in to exploit the RCE vulnerability by uploading malicious PHP files. XSS can be triggered via content management screens and theme file editors.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the baserCMS system. For RCE, the attacker needs the ability to upload files. For XSS, they need to be able to access content management or theme editing sections."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "ThemeFilesController.php",
    "UploaderFilesController.php"
  ],
  "affected_versions": "< 4.3.6",
  "patched_versions": "4.3.7",
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was found by the Vulnerability Research team at Flatt Security Inc. The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary files. XSS can be achieved in content management or theme file editors. The fix includes sanitizing user input and restricting file uploads."
