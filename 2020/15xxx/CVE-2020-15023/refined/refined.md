Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2020-15023 is a flaw in the implementation of the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) protocol in the Askey AP5100W Access Point. Specifically, the access point uses "random" numbers that can be guessed or calculated during the M3 message exchange of the WPS "cryptodance".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **WPS PIN Code Cracking:** The vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of the M3 message exchange within the WPS protocol. The AP does not properly seal its bid (encryption), allowing an attacker to crack the encryption and reveal the WPS PIN.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Network Access:** By successfully cracking the WPS PIN, an attacker gains access to the Wi-Fi network's WPA2 passphrase.
- **Further Attacks:** Once connected to the network, the attacker can perform further attacks on other devices and resources within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within a reasonable distance (up to approximately 50m if a strong device is being used) of the vulnerable AP.
- **Wireless Card:** The attacker requires a wireless card that supports monitor mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Proximity:** The attacker must be in close physical proximity to the target access point.
- **Technical Skills:** The attacker requires a moderate level of technical skills to utilize tools like `reaver` and `pixiewps`.
- **Tools:** The attacker needs access to tools like Kali Linux (or similar with Reaver) and a wireless card supporting monitor mode.
- **Knowledge:** The attacker must know how to use the attack tools and have knowledge of the WPS protocol's weaknesses.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content gives significant detail about the vulnerability and exploitation process including commands used for exploitation.
- The content explains that the vulnerability is due to the AP's failure to properly encrypt data within the WPS protocol, making the "random numbers" used guessable and the WPS PIN easily obtainable by the attacker.
- The content also mentions that the fix for the vulnerability was a patch (Dual_SIG_1.01.101) rolled out to users after the researcher's findings.
- The vulnerability is easily exploitable, where an attacker is able to obtain the network's WPA2 passphrase in seconds using the 'pixiedust' tool.
