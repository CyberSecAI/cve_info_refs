Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `os.MkdirAll` in etcd, which creates directories, including the etcd data directory and the directory path used for generating self-signed certificates. `os.MkdirAll` does not check existing directory permissions. If a directory exists with weaker permissions than expected (e.g., 700), `os.MkdirAll` will not change them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The primary weakness is the lack of permission checks on existing directories created via `os.MkdirAll`. This could lead to a situation where etcd creates or uses directories with overly permissive access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** If a directory used by etcd has overly permissive permissions, unauthorized users might be able to access or modify sensitive data or configuration information.
*   **Compromise:** Depending on the data and the context, unauthorized access might lead to compromise of the system or etcd itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system could potentially create a directory with weak permissions before etcd creates the directory.
*   **Pre-existing Misconfiguration:** If an existing directory had incorrect permissions prior to etcd's use of the directory via `os.MkdirAll`, the incorrect permissions would not be corrected by etcd.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where etcd is running, with the ability to create directories.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to create the target directory with weak permissions prior to etcd attempting to create it.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix for this issue was included in etcd versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23.
*   The vulnerability is considered to be of moderate severity.
*   The identified workaround is to ensure that the relevant directories have the correct permissions (700).
*   The vulnerability is also addressed in Fedora 32 by updating the etcd package to version 3.4.13-1.fc32.
