Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in PHP. Specifically, the `yii\db\BatchQueryResult` class in versions prior to 2.0.38 was susceptible to arbitrary code execution via `unserialize()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary weakness is the ability to pass a specially crafted serialized string to `unserialize()` that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is because `unserialize()` in PHP can instantiate objects, which might trigger vulnerable methods or properties during the deserialization process.
- The `BatchQueryResult` class was serializable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the vulnerable Yii framework application is hosted. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-provided input being passed to the `unserialize()` function without proper sanitization or validation, specifically when the application calls `unserialize()` on user-controlled input containing a specially crafted serialized `BatchQueryResult` object.
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a serialized string to `unserialize()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the data that is being passed to the `unserialize()` function.
- The attacker needs to know that the application uses `unserialize()` on some user controlled input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the unserialization of `yii\db\BatchQueryResult` objects in version 2.0.38 by throwing a `BadMethodCallException` within the `__wakeup()` method. Additionally, the `__sleep()` method was also added to throw an exception to prevent serialization of the object.
- The commit message indicates the `unserialize()` was disabled to prevent remote code execution.
- The vulnerability was discovered by nt0xa.
