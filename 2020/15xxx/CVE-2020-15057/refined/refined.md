The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15057.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation when setting the server name, allowing a buffer overflow by sending long input values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: Sending excessively long input values for the server name can cause a buffer overflow in the device's memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The buffer overflow can crash the USB network server, rendering it unresponsive and requiring a reboot or reset. The overflow could also overwrite other variables.
- Potential for Code Execution: Although not investigated, the buffer overflow could potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker on the local network can send specially crafted network packets with long server name inputs to the vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable USB network server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server.
