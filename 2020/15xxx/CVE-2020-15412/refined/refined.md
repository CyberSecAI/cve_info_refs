Based on the provided commit diff, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `contact` function of the `EventsController.php` file within the MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) application.  The code was not checking if the user had the necessary permissions (ACL - Access Control List) before allowing them to send an event contact form.  This meant that a user could potentially send a contact form for an event they did not have proper access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control Check:** The code lacked a check to verify if the user has the required permissions to access and interact with the event via the contact form. This allows unauthorized users to potentially trigger actions related to events that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker without the correct permissions could potentially gather information about an event by interacting with the contact form, even if they are not authorized to view the event's details directly.
*   **Potential for Misuse/Abuse:** The contact form could be potentially misused.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request:** An attacker could directly access the `contact` action for an event by crafting a request and sending it to the server without going through the expected user interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker would need to be an authenticated user on the MISP platform, even if they do not have the required privileges to access the specific event.
*   **Knowledge of Event ID:**  The attacker would need to know or be able to obtain a valid event ID for an event they do not have access to.

**Additional Details:**
The fix in the commit adds the following line:
```php
if (!$this->Acl->check($this->Auth->user(), 'Events/view', $id, 'Event')) {
    throw new UnauthorizedException('You are not authorized to contact the event owner');
}
```
This code checks that the user is authorized to view the event before allowing them to continue.
