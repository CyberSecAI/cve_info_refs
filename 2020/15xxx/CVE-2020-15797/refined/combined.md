**PRODUCT DESCRIPTION**
The DCA Vantage Analyzer is a multi-parameter, point-of-care analyzer for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes and detecting early kidney disease.
 **VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION**
The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1)<https://www.first.org/cvss>. The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

**Vulnerability CVE-2020-7590**
Affected devices use a hard-coded password to protect the onboard database. This could allow an attacker to open and or modify the onboard database. Successful exploitation requires direct physical access to the device.
CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.4
CVSS Vector CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
CWE: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
 **Vulnerability CVE-2020-15797**
Improper Access Control could allow an unauthenticated attacker to escape from the restricted environment (“kiosk mode”) and access the underlying operating system. Successful exploitation requires direct physical access to the system.
CVSS v3.1 Base Score 2.4
CVSS Vector CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
