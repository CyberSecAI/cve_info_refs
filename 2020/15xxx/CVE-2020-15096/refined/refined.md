Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15096:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in V8's Promise.then implementation allowed a context isolation bypass in Electron applications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Context Isolation Bypass: Code running in the main world context of a renderer process could access the isolated Electron context. This violates the intended security boundary of context isolation, which is designed to prevent such access.
- Privilege Escalation: By bypassing context isolation, malicious code in the main world context could perform actions with the elevated privileges available in the Electron context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious code in the renderer could perform privileged actions, potentially compromising the entire application and the system it runs on. This could lead to data breaches, arbitrary code execution, or other forms of malicious activity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through malicious JavaScript code running in the main world context of a renderer process. This code can exploit the V8 bug to gain access to the isolated Electron context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject or execute malicious JavaScript code within the main world context of an Electron application's renderer process. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting a vulnerability in the application itself (e.g., XSS), or compromising a resource that the application loads (e.g., a compromised website).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in Electron versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x and 9.x before specific patch releases.
- There were no app-side workarounds available.
- The vulnerability was assigned a "High" severity rating.
