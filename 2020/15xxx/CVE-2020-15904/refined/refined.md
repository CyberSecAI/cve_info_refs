Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15904:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing or incorrect bounds check in the `patch` function within the `bsdiff4/core.c` file. Specifically, during the patch application process, the code was not properly checking for potential buffer overflows when reading and applying diff and extra data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing bounds check:** The original code lacked a proper check to ensure that the calculated `newpos + x` and `newpos + y` values (representing positions in the new data buffer) did not exceed the allocated buffer size (`newDataLength`). Also, checks related to `diffPtr` and `extraPtr` were insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** An attacker could craft a malicious patch file that, when applied, would cause the `patch` function to write data beyond the allocated buffer (`newData`). This could lead to:
    - **Memory Corruption:** Overwriting adjacent memory regions.
    - **Crash:** Causing the application to crash due to memory access violations.
    - **Potential Code Execution:** In some scenarios, if the attacker can precisely control the overflow, they might achieve code execution by overwriting return addresses or other critical data on the stack or heap.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Patch File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted patch file that contains carefully chosen values for x, y and z that cause the bounds check to fail and write outside of the allocated buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Supply Patch File:** The attacker must be able to supply the vulnerable application with a crafted patch file. This could be achieved through various means depending on the application's use case (e.g. a compromised software update mechanism, an application taking user-provided patch files etc.).

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a fix for this vulnerability, by adding additional checks to prevent buffer overflows and returning an error if a malformed patch file is detected.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.0, which includes the commit `49a4cee2feef7deaf9d89e5e793a8824930284d7`.
- The changelog states: "*apply patch from Robert Scott to fix some bounds checking (this fixes an issue which has been assigned CVE-2020-15904)*"
