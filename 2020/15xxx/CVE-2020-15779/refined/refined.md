{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `socket.io-file` package does not properly sanitize user-provided file names during upload, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload files to arbitrary locations on the server file system, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones outside of the intended upload directory. This can lead to various malicious outcomes such as arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted `socket.io-file::createFile` message with a malicious `name` option containing relative path specifiers (e.g., `../../`), an attacker can bypass the intended upload directory and write files elsewhere.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send messages to the socket.io server."
  },
  "affected_versions": "<= 2.0.31",
