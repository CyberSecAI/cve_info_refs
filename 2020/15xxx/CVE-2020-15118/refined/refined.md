{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the `wagtail.contrib.forms` form builder app where HTML tags within form field help text are rendered unescaped when using Django's standard form rendering helpers (e.g., `form.as_p`). This is because Django's `help_text` field is designed to allow HTML, but Wagtail's policy is to prevent arbitrary HTML from editor-level users due to the risk of XSS attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "HTML Injection",
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code via form field help text, leading to XSS attacks, potentially including privilege escalation if the attacker targets admin users.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the Wagtail admin interface where editors can define form field help text. If the form page template renders form fields using Django's standard rendering helpers (e.g., `form.as_p`), the injected HTML will be rendered without escaping.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to the Wagtail admin interface with the ability to create or edit form pages and their fields."
