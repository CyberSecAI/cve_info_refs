Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15956

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `ActiveMediaServer.exe` component of ACTi NVR3 Standard Server. This occurs when the server receives a malformed authorization header with a payload of at least 760 bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, where the application attempts to write more data into a fixed-size buffer than it can hold.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to the termination of the `ActiveMediaServer.exe` process, causing a denial of service. This effectively renders the server unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based, meaning it can be launched remotely.
- **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers. This means that no login credentials are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to Send Malformed HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed HTTP request containing a crafted authorization header.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ACTi NVR 2.3 Standard/Professional Server and ACTi NVR3 Standard/Professional Server. Specifically, versions such as ACTi NVR3 Standard Server V.3.0.12.42 are mentioned as vulnerable.
- The vendor has fixed the vulnerability in NVR3 V.3.0.15.50.
- A Python exploit script (`cve-2020-15956.py`) is available, demonstrating the exploit.
