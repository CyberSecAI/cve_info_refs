Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) issue. Specifically, the `apport` package lacks proper locking mechanisms when performing operations on a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition arising from the lack of proper locking during file operations within `apport`. This means that the state of a file can change between the time it's checked and the time it's actually used by the program.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to root.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system, implying they already have some form of low-privileged account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must possess the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker needs to leverage the TOCTOU race condition within the `apport` package.
- Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation and the ability to execute code as root.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ryota Shiga working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Canonical has released updates to correct this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in Ubuntu releases 20.04 LTS, 18.04 ESM, 16.04 ESM, and 14.04 ESM.
