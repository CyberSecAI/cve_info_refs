Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-15969:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Use-after-free error in the WebRTC component of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** A memory corruption vulnerability occurs when code attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to various issues including crashes, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Heap corruption:** By exploiting the UAF, a remote attacker can corrupt the heap, a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Sandbox escape:** The vulnerability can be used to potentially escape the browser's sandbox, which aims to restrict the browser's access to system resources and other applications and thereby compromise the underlying operating system.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit can lead to an attacker executing arbitrary code, potentially taking control of the affected system.
*   **Information disclosure:** A successful exploit can expose sensitive data due to the use-after-free.
*   **Denial of Service:** The exploitation may cause the application to crash and become unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote attackers.
*   **Crafted HTML page:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by enticing a user to load a specially crafted HTML page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Compromised renderer process (Chrome context):**  The attacker needs to have compromised the renderer process (which executes web content) in Chrome to perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to interact with the crafted malicious page.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Google Chrome prior to version 86.0.4240.75
*   The vulnerability is also present in Apple's Safari browser.
*   The vulnerability also affects Apple's tvOS and watchOS.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "important" in severity by SUSE, and "high" by RedHat.
*   SUSE bugzilla entries [1177408](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177408), [1177872](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177872), [1177977](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177977) are related to this CVE.
*   Apple's advisory mentions the vulnerability was reported by "an anonymous researcher."
*   The fix for this vulnerability requires an update of the browser.
