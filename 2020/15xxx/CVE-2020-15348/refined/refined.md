{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unsafe calls to `eval()` in the `/live/CPEManager/AXCampaignManager/delete_cpes_by_ids` API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unsafe use of `eval()` leading to command injection.",
     "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) as the `axess` user within a chrooted environment.  Chroot escape is possible, achieving root access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable API endpoint with a payload that executes arbitrary code within `eval()`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface on port 9673, reachable over the WAN interface."
