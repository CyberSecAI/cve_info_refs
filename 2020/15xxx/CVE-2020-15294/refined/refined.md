- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Compiler optimization removes or modifies security-critical code in `IntPeParseUnwindData()`, leading to multiple dereferences of the same pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition due to multiple dereferences of a pointer located in guest-mapped memory. The compiler optimization caused the same memory location to be read multiple times without ensuring the data consistency in between reads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires the pointer being dereferenced to be located in memory mapped from the guest space.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to control the guest space and influence the memory being mapped to the hypervisor to trigger the race condition. This requires low level privileges within the guest.
