- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in Arista's EOS routing process related to malformed IS-IS link-state PDUs. Specifically, the `isis_pdu_parse_xngb_subtlvs` function is affected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of malformed IS-IS link-state PDUs which results in a crash of the routing agent.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - The IS-IS protocol (in Multi-Agent mode) or all layer 3 protocols (in Ribd, single routing agent mode) can be affected if the IS-IS Router receives a malformed link-state PDU.
    - The effect will be agent restarts (Rib process or IS-IS process, depending on the routing protocol mode).
    - These restarts can trigger route churn, leading to potential traffic loss or incorrect forwarding.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed IS-IS link-state PDU to an affected Arista EOS device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to send malformed IS-IS packets to the targeted Arista device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attack can be performed from an adjacent network.
