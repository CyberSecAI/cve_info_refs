{
  "CVE-2020-15673": {
    "Description": "Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Memory safety bugs",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "Unspecified. Presumed to be via a crafted web page",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unspecified. Requires user interaction to open the malicious page.",
        "More Details": "Fixed in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3"
  },
  "CVE-2020-15676": {
    "Description": "Firefox sometimes ran the onload handler for SVG elements that the DOM sanitizer decided to remove, resulting in JavaScript being executed after pasting attacker-controlled data into a contenteditable element.",
        "Root cause": "Improper handling of SVG onload handler after DOM sanitization.",
        "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
        "Impact": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
    "Attack vectors": "Pasting attacker-controlled data into a contenteditable element.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control the data that is pasted. Requires user interaction.",
    "More Details": "This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3."
  },
  "CVE-2020-15677": {
    "Description": "By exploiting an Open Redirect vulnerability on a website, an attacker could have spoofed the site displayed in the download file dialog to show the original site (the one suffering from the open redirect) rather than the site the file was actually downloaded from.",
    "Root cause": "Open Redirect vulnerability on a website",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Open Redirect",
      "Spoofing"
    ],
    "Impact": "Spoofed site displayed in download file dialog.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting an Open Redirect vulnerability on a website and downloading a file from it.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control the website used to initiate download. Requires user interaction to initiate download.",
    "More Details": "This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3."
  },
  "CVE-2020-15678": {
    "Description": "When recursing through layers while scrolling, an iterator may have become invalid, resulting in a potential use-after-free.",
    "Root cause": "Improper iterator handling in APZCTreeManager::ComputeClippedCompositionBounds.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential use-after-free vulnerability, may lead to memory corruption.",
     "Attack vectors": "Triggering recursion through layers while scrolling.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control the scrolling behavior. Requires user interaction to perform the scrolling.",
        "More Details": "This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3."
