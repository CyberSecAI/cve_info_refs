# Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name

Critical

[Kenny2github](/Kenny2github)
published
GHSA-8fq5-g4m5-6j43
Aug 28, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.1

## Patched versions

1.1

## Description

### Impact

Affects all users on any wiki using this extension. Any account can be logged into by using the same username with leading, trailing, or repeated underscore(s), since those are treated as whitespace and trimmed by MediaWiki.

### Patches

Since version 1.1, comments by users whose usernames would be trimmed on MediaWiki are ignored when searching for the verification code.

### Workarounds

* Disable the extension (remove `wfLoadExtension( 'ScratchLogin' )` or `wfLoadExtension( 'mediawiki-scratch-login' )`)
* If you still want to use the extension, update your version of the extension now.

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15164

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
