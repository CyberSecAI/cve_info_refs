**Summary of CVE-2020-15811 Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Squid's incorrect handling and string search of Transfer-Encoding headers, allowing injection of a second HTTP request and causing HTTP request splitting and cache poisoning, and its failure to properly validate HTTP header data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper input validation leading to HTTP Request Splitting, relaxed header parsing.
*   **Impact:** Cache poisoning, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary content into the cache, bypassing local security controls and potentially affecting downstream caches.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Sending crafted HTTP requests with specially formed headers (Transfer-Encoding or malformed Content-Length headers) over network access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access is required, low privileges are sufficient.

The documents indicate that this vulnerability affects various versions of Squid before 4.13 and 5.0.4 and has been addressed through updates in multiple distributions, such as SUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, as well as in NetApp's Cloud Manager.
