- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation in the Bitdefender Update Server and BEST Relay components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-side request forgery (SSRF) due to insufficient validation, allowing an attacker to interact with hosts on the network.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged attacker can bypass in-place mitigations and interact with hosts on the network. The vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** Local network access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unprivileged attacker needs access to the local network where the vulnerable Bitdefender Update Server is located.
