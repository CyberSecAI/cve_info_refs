Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2020-15677:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **Open Redirect (CWE-601)** on a website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Download origin spoofing**: An attacker could exploit the open redirect to make the download file dialog display the *original* site (with the open redirect) rather than the *actual* site the file is downloaded from.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofed Download Origin**: Attackers can trick users into downloading and executing malicious files by falsely representing the source of the download, increasing the likelihood that users will trust and run the file.
*   **Circumvention of Security Features**: On macOS, Gatekeeper, which is intended to verify downloads, could wrongly state the trusted site as the origin rather than the actual download source.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Open Redirect Exploitation**: The attacker needs a website with an existing Open Redirect vulnerability.
*   **HTTP POST Redirect**: Specifically, the issue is triggered by the use of the HTTP POST method when a redirect occurs. The problem occurs when a POST request redirects to a download.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to control a website that they can make the browser redirect to via an open redirect.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to initiate the download somehow, such as by clicking submit on a malicious form on a trusted website or navigating directly to a malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Browser Behaviour:** The vulnerability is primarily related to the display information in Firefox's Download Manager UI after a redirect occurs with a POST request.
    *   The download dialog correctly shows the actual download location.
    *   However, once the download finishes, the browser download list incorrectly attributes the file origin as the original site.
*   **Fix**:  The fix is to stop using the referrer in the download UI, so that the actual download location is displayed rather than the location where the redirect originated.

This vulnerability was addressed in:

*   Firefox ESR 78.3
*   Firefox 81
*   Thunderbird 78.3
