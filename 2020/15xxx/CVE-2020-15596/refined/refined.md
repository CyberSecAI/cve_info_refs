Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2020-15596:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ALPS ALPINE Touchpad driver attempts to load DLLs that are not consistently included in the driver package.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
DLL preloading vulnerability/DLL hijacking

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially execute malicious code by placing a malicious DLL in a directory that the vulnerable driver searches for DLLs. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the driver.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to gain control of one of the DLL search directories used by the ALPS ALPINE Touchpad driver to place their malicious DLL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the DLL search paths. The provided CVSS vector indicates that high privileges are needed (`PR:H`) along with local access (`AV:L`). While user interaction is not required `UI:N`, the attack requires high privileges.
