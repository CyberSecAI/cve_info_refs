{
  "CVE-2020-15503": {
    "description": "LibRaw before 0.20-RC1 lacks a thumbnail size range check. This affects decoders/unpack_thumb.cpp, postprocessing/mem_image.cpp, and utils/thumb_utils.cpp. For example, malloc(sizeof(libraw_processed_image_t)+T.tlength) occurs without validating T.tlength.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of thumbnail sizes before memory allocation. Specifically, the `tlength` variable, which determines the amount of memory to allocate for a thumbnail, isn't checked for excessively large values before being used in `malloc` calls.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input validation",
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a buffer overflow by providing a crafted RAW image with a large thumbnail size, leading to a denial of service or possibly other exploitable consequences due to out-of-bounds memory access.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Processing a specially crafted RAW image file."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted RAW image file to a vulnerable application that uses LibRaw to process it."
    },
     "affected_components":[
        "decoders/unpack_thumb.cpp",
        "postprocessing/mem_image.cpp",
        "utils/thumb_utils.cpp"
    ],
    "additional_information": {
      "fix_details": "The fix involves adding checks to ensure the thumbnail size does not exceed a maximum allowed value and is not less than a minimum value, preventing the allocation of excessively large or invalid memory chunks, by adding the macros `THUMB_SIZE_CHECKT`, `THUMB_SIZE_CHECKTNZ`, and `THUMB_SIZE_CHECKWH`.",
      "affected_versions": "LibRaw versions before 0.20-RC1 are affected.",
       "cvss_v3_vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (NVD) , CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L (SUSE)"
