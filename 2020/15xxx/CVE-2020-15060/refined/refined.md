  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The server name parameter is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it is embedded into a JavaScript file unfiltered and unescaped.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper input validation",
       "Lack of output encoding"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they visit the web administration interface. This can lead to persistent access to the interface and further attacks on other systems in the local network through the victim's browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the stored server name via HTTP request to the web server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker on the local network can insert a malicious script into the server name. This can be done through the web interface. This is more effective when combined with the authentication bypass vulnerability. The attacker does not need to know the administrative password for the web interface if the authentication bypass vulnerability is also present."
