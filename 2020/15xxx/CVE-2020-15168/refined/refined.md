Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15168

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `node-fetch` library did not properly enforce the `size` option when following HTTP redirects. This means that if a server responded with a redirect to a resource exceeding the specified size limit, `node-fetch` would not throw a `FetchError` as expected. It would continue downloading the large file, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or other issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Failure to enforce the `size` option after redirects.
- Vulnerability to Denial of Service (DoS) if the server redirects to an overly large file.
- Unexpected behavior, making it difficult for developers to rely on the size limit option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause a server to redirect to a very large file which `node-fetch` would download. This could cause the JavaScript thread to get tied up doing work on the large file, potentially leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness and increased computing costs.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Downloading a very large file without a size limit can consume significant resources, including memory and network bandwidth.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Applications relying on `node-fetch` to enforce size limits could fail to detect when they receive files larger than the limit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can control a server that the affected application is requesting data from, and configure the server to respond with a redirect to a large file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a server that the application is making requests to.
- The attacker needs to be able to set the `Location` header in the HTTP response to redirect the request to a large file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `node-fetch` versions prior to 2.6.1 and 3.0.0-beta.9.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in versions 2.6.1 and 3.0.0-beta.9.
- It is strongly recommended to update to the patched versions to address this issue.
- This vulnerability is categorized as having "Moderate" severity.
