- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Certificate Validation in the Online Threat Prevention module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a bypass of HSTS, potentially allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers could intercept or modify communication between the user and the server. This can lead to data exposure or manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is in the Online Threat Prevention module, which suggests a network-based attack vector where an attacker could manipulate network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, potentially through a man-in-the-middle attack. User interaction is required, as indicated by the UI:R (User Interaction: Required) CVSS vector. The CVSS vector indicates a network attack vector (AV:N) with low complexity (AC:L) and no privileges required (PR:N).
