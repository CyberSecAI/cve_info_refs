Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15706:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2020-15706 and describes the vulnerability as a "use-after-free" issue in GRUB2's script handling code. This aligns with the official description of the CVE (when available).

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: A race condition exists in the `grub_script_function_create()` function. When a function is redefined during its execution, it can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    *   Use-after-free vulnerability due to lack of proper handling of function redefinition during execution in grub2's script handling code.
    *   The race condition leads to a heap based memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   Arbitrary code execution
    *   Bypass of UEFI Secure Boot restrictions
    *   Ability to load untrusted binaries.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   Local access with administrative privileges (or physical access to the system) is required to modify GRUB2 configuration or files.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting a use-after-free race condition while redefining function during execution.
    *   Crafted configuration files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   Local access to the system with administrative privileges.
    *   Ability to modify or inject code into grub configuration files.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.
*   The fix for this issue involves a patch to the GRUB2 source code to properly handle the function redefinition, and also a revocation list is published to prevent loading of previously released vulnerable binaries.
*  Multiple vendors are releasing updates including SUSE and Ubuntu.

**4. Summary of Relevant Content**

The vulnerability is a race condition that leads to use-after-free in the script handling code of GRUB2. An attacker needs local access with administrative privileges to trigger the vulnerability by redefining functions during execution, which leads to arbitrary code execution. This can be exploited to bypass secure boot and execute unsigned code. Patches, updated shims and revocation lists are required to fix this vulnerability.
