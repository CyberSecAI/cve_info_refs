Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15275:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of SVG files uploaded to the MoinMoin wiki.  Malicious JavaScript code embedded within an SVG file can be executed when a user views the file on the wiki.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the ability to store malicious JavaScript within an SVG file, which then executes in the context of other users' browsers when they view the SVG file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the wiki
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File upload:** The primary attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **User interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the malicious SVG file on the wiki.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Write permissions:** The attacker needs write permissions on the MoinMoin wiki to be able to upload attachments.
*   **Ability to craft malicious SVG:** The attacker needs to create or obtain a malicious SVG file that contains JavaScript.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in MoinMoin Wiki version 1.9.11
*   The fix involves adding 'image/svg+xml' to the list of mimetypes that are XSS protected.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Catarina Leite from the Checkmarx SCA AppSec team.
*   Workarounds are discouraged, and upgrading to the patched version is advised. However, a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the web server could provide some mitigation. Restricting write permissions to trusted users is also a suggested preventative measure.
