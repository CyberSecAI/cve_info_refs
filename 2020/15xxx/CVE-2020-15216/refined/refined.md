  "cveId": "CVE-2020-15216",
  "description": "In goxmldsig (XML Digital Signatures implemented in pure Go) before version 1.1.0, with a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely bypass signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one. A patch is available, all users of goxmldsig should upgrade to at least revision f6188febf0c29d7ffe26a0436212b19cb9615e64 or version 1.1.0",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in how the library parses and validates the XML signature. It does not properly check the structure of the Signature element, which can be exploited to bypass validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The library fails to validate the structure of the Signature element, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML and bypass signature verification.",
        "Specifically, the library does not enforce the expected number of SignedInfo, KeyInfo, and SignatureValue tags within a Signature element. This oversight allows an attacker to construct a malicious XML structure that is still considered valid by the library's parsing logic."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can completely bypass signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one. This could allow for the execution of malicious code, data tampering, or other security breaches, depending on the context in which XML signatures are being used.",
    "attackVectors": "The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted XML file. By manipulating the structure of the XML, specifically the number of occurrences of specific tags within the Signature element, an attacker can bypass signature validation.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft or modify an XML file that includes a signature that would normally be validated by the goxmldsig library. The attacker also needs to have the ability to get the application to process the crafted XML file."
  },
  "affectedSoftware": {
    "name": "goxmldsig",
    "version": "<= 1.1.0"
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Upgrade to version 1.1.0 or later which includes a fix that validates the structure of the Signature element prior to processing.",
        "The fix involves validating the shape of the signature object by checking for the existence of exactly one SignedInfo tag, at most one KeyInfo tag, and exactly one SignatureValue tag. This check is performed before unmarshalling the signature."
  ],
   "additonalNotes": [
        "The vulnerability is addressed in commit `f6188febf0c29d7ffe26a0436212b19cb9615e64`",
        "This issue was assigned the GitHub Security Advisory `GHSA-q547-gmf8-8jr7`"
