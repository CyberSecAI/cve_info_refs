# OWASP CRSProject

## The 1st Line of Defense

The **OWASP¬Æ CRS** is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with
[ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) or compatible web application firewalls.
The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks,
including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts.
The CRS provides protection against many common attack categories.

# ModSecurity v3 affected by DoS (CVE-2020-15598)

---

*From*: Christian Folini <christian.folini () netnea com>

*Date*: Mon, 14 Sep 2020 09:53:44 +0200

```
ModSecurity v3.0.x is affected by a Denial of Service vulnerability due to the
global matching of regular expressions. The combination of a non-anchored
regular expression and the ModSecurity ‚Äúcapture‚Äù action can be exploited via a
specially crafted payload.

While ModSecurity v2.x used to quit the execution of a regular expression
after the first match. ModSecurity v3.0.x silently changed the behavior to
global matching. This results in a DoS for existing non-anchored regexes in
rules containing the ‚Äúcapture‚Äù action. It also fills the TX variable space
beyond the documented limit of 10 instances. The defense is handicapped due to
the absence of the SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit directive. The vendor Trustwave
Spiderlabs dropped this functionality for ModSecurity v3.

The vendor did not publish a new release, but there is a patch that brings
back the former behavior.

Core Rule Set developers say high-impact bug was introduced via undocumented changes to open source WAF

![ModSecurity maintainers contest denial-of-service security vulnerability](/cms/images/2f/3d/aadb-article-200914-modsecurity-1200-675.jpg "Image: PortSwigger Ltd")

UPDATED The maintainers of the open source ModSecurity web application firewall (WAF) module have rejected claims that the technology is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) exploit that could halt servers running the software.

In a [security advisory](https://coreruleset.org/20200914/cve-2020-15598/) issued today (September 14), developers from the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) said ModSecurity v3 is exposed to DoS exploits due to the global matching of regular expressions (regex).

The vulnerability, CRS developers said, was introduced via undocumented changes to the underlying ModSecurity engine.

‚ÄúThe combination of a non-anchored regular expression and the ModSecurity ‚Äòcapture‚Äô action can be exploited via a specially crafted payload,‚Äù the researchers said in their official advisory for CVE-2020-15598.

‚ÄúWhile ModSecurity v2.x used to quit the execution of a regular expression after the first match, ModSecurity v3.0.x silently changed the behavior to global matching.‚Äù

According to the researchers, this results in a DoS for existing non-anchored regexes containing the ‚Äòcapture‚Äô action.

### Denial of denial-of-service

ModSecurity is a popular WAF that‚Äôs designed to help stop [attacks](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cyber-attacks) or unwanted behavior against applications by monitoring all HTTP traffic in real time. The open source project is maintained by Trustwave SpiderLabs.

The tool works through the implementation of WAF rules. Web admins can create their own custom rules or deploy existing libraries, such as the free-to-install OWASP Core Rule Set.

Responding to The Daily Swig‚Äôs request for comment on the CRS developers‚Äô purported discovery, a Trustwave spokesperson said that while changes were made to the ModSecurity engine, they did not introduce a security vulnerability:

There was a change in regular expression matching in ModSecurity 3.x (libModSecurity) that provided additional functionality for our users. We do not consider this a vulnerability for a couple of reasons.

First, there is no default configuration issue here. An attacker would need to know that a rule using a potentially problematic regular expression was in place.

Second, the attacker would need to know the basic nature of the regular expression itself in order to exploit any resource issues and while those resources issues may cause a slowdown for resources, we have not been able to replicate.

It‚Äôs well known that regular expression usage can be taxing on system resources regardless of the use case. It is up to the administrator to make the decision on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential security benefit.

### Back and forth

Christian Folini, co-lead of the OWASP Core Rule Set development team, called Trustwave‚Äôs response into question.

‚ÄúAs ModSecurity is only the engine, you need rules to expose the vulnerability,‚Äù Folini told The Daily Swig.

‚ÄúTo blame the problem on the rules does not make much sense in this architecture. It‚Äôs like stating that the server would have been secure if nobody has hooked it on the internet.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúNow, can you guess what rules are installed on the server? Most people have CRS installed when they run ModSecurity. And CRS has dozens of rules that are affected by this silent change of behavior.‚Äù

[Read more of the latest open source software security news](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/open-source-software)

According to Folini, the CRS team has insisted that the ModSecurity maintainers fast-track a release that includes mitigations to the alleged vulnerability.

However, with SpiderLabs maintaining that the changes have not introduced a security flaw, the CRS team said it would roll out its own mitigations.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll provide users with the minimal patch for 3.0.4, so they can fix this themselves,‚Äù Folini said. ‚ÄúWe'll also provide workarounds for users running CRS and being stuck on the old and insecure ModSecurity 3.0.4.‚Äù

Trustwave has released more information on the disputed CVE in a [blog post](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/modsecurity-regular-expressions-and-disputed-cve-2020-15598/).

‚ÄúWe continue to tune the regular expression functionality in ModSecurity based on the use cases our user base most commonly employ,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

‚ÄúWe expect the next release will cover both methods of regular expression matching (global and single matching) to provide users the ultimate in flexibility in rule development.‚Äù

# OWASPModsecurity Project

![Rules protecting a safe](/images/plugged.png)
## The 1st Line of Defense

[ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/) is an open source, cross-platform web application firewall (WAF) module.
Known as the ‚ÄúSwiss Army Knife‚Äù of WAFs, it enables web application defenders to gain
visibility into HTTP(S) traffic and provides a power rules language and API to implement
advanced protections.

[Get latest v2: 2.9.7](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/releases/tag/v2.9.7)
[Get latest v3: 3.0.12](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/releases/tag/v3.0.12)
## The most widespread open source WAF

Used by businesses, government organizations, internet service providers, and commercial WAF vendors alike on

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them ‚Äî but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named ‚ÄúSecurity Product of the Year‚Äù by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap¬†-v¬†-A¬†*targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (‚ÄúNetwork Mapper‚Äù) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the ‚Äúinteresting ports
table‚Äù.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example¬†15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example¬†15.1.¬†A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

![ModSecurity Regular Expressions and Disputed CVE-2020-15598](https://www.trustwave.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Web/Spiders/2024/spider_01-mob.png?width=450&height=250&name=spider_01-mob.png)

8 Minute Read
by SpiderLabs Researcher

ModSecurity is an open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF) engine maintained by Trustwave. The core of ModSecurity‚Äôs strength as an engine lies in providing a rule language that can be utilized by ModSecurity users to create protections against whichever vulnerabilities are relevant for the user‚Äôs use case. This means that it can do a lot of things, but like any scripting language, the wider the range of capabilities you provide, the greater the responsibility you put on users to use them correctly. That is a tradeoff we constantly have to manage in ModSecurity.

This blog post will discuss that tradeoff in the context of regular expressions in ModSecurity. It will cover an issue raised by a member of the community as a security issue (assigned CVE-2020-15598), which we disputed, and some tips for how to avoid the more problematic aspects of regular expressions in ModSecurity.

For those of you who don‚Äôt care for the details, feel free to jump directly to the **‚ÄúHow to Avoid Taxing Your ModSecurity Regular Expressions‚Äù** section of this post.

### The Evolution of Regular Expressions in ModSecurity

Regular expressions in particular are challenging because they can easily become taxing in terms of performance, but at the same time, they are an absolute necessity for our users to be able to craft complex (and even not-so-complex) rules. As such, the use of regular expression (regex) matching is available via several operators in the ModSecurity language, with a general warning in the [documentation](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#rx) indicating that it is a powerful tool and should be used carefully. The phrase ‚Äúuse carefully‚Äù is not an ideal piece of advice since it‚Äôs very general, but at the same time covering all the risks involved in using regular expressions in ModSecurity (and in general) would be lengthy and beyond the proper scope of ModSecurity documentation, so at some point, we have to leave that in the hands of our users.

This gets somewhat more complicated, however, as we make changes and improvements to the engine, which is what happened in ModSecurity v3 (libModSecurity). libModSecurity was a full rewrite of the engine, moving away from dependency on Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and allowing ModSecurity to become more modular as well as interact with anything that could make use of ModSecurity‚Äôs capability through connectors. In terms of the rule language, the first goal of the engine rewrite was to bring it up to par with the latest version of ModSecurity 2.x at the time, which meant supporting the same set of variables, operators, actions, etc.

Not all of these ended up happening fully: certain things that existed in 2.x no longer made sense in 3.x, and thanks to this being an open-source project some features turned out not to be important to the community (i.e. nobody missed them) so we focused our attention on what we and the community saw as a priority.

Other than re-creating what we already had, libModSecurity was an opportunity to make some improvements along the way as code was rewritten and refactored. One such change that was made during the development of libModSecurity was to the @rx operator, the most common operator that uses regular expression matching.

The @rx operator in 2.x performed a single match, meaning that if you created a rule with the logic:

`SecRule ARGS:someArg ‚Äú@rx (badstring[0-9])‚Äù ‚Ä¶`

ModSecurity would attempt to match an argument called ‚ÄúsomeArg‚Äù with the provided expression. Once it found a match it would instantly stop processing and proceed to perform whatever action the rule defined. In libModSecurity‚Äôs implementation, the @rx operator performed global matching, meaning ModSecurity would attempt to look for **all** matches for the given expression, not just the first one.

This may seem like a curious choice since in many cases a single match is enough to satisfy the rule‚Äôs logic, but it makes more sense when you consider the ‚Äúcapture‚Äù action in ModSecurity, which allows you to save the matches of a regular expression into variables which can then be further processed by a different rule. If you wanted to capture and save all appearances of an expression within a variable, and you didn‚Äôt know how many there might be, you would not be able to do this in 2.x. Global matching makes this a possibility. In addition, since a single match would still be captured the same way, that functionality is not lost in the process. The downside of global matching is that it inevitably requires more resources. If you ask ModSecurity to capture many instances of a string within a lot of data, that is going to take both time and resources to find (and save) all of those instances.

### Dispute Over CVE-2020-15598

Fast-forward several years to June 12th, 2020 when one of our researchers was looking into [an issue](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/issues/2336) related to capture groups not being recorded correctly. During the investigation, the researcher also noticed the global matching behavior and raised the point that for many common use cases a single match is sufficient and there is no need to continue searching. However, while we were discussing this change we encountered real use cases where the functionality of global matching would be needed and concluded that removing the functionality altogether would take that option away from our users. In the end, we decided that the best resolution was to return the @rx operator to performing a single match (and thus sparing the processing time in most use cases) and moving the global matching functionality to its own operator, [@rxGlobal](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/pull/2396).¬† The first part was incorporated into the main branch shortly after (as it also addressed the user‚Äôs original issue with capture groups) with plans to implement the second part by the release of the upcoming version of ModSecurity.

On June 15th we received a report about a potential DoS vulnerability in ModSecurity. The reported use case was a rule which searches for a specific ‚Äúbadstring‚Äù, and the test input is that variable containing many matches of ‚Äúbadstring‚Äù (to give an idea of what ‚Äúmany‚Äù means, in his example, over 65,000 matches existed). This produced the situation described above, where we ask the engine to do a lot of work (find all instances of ‚Äúbadstring‚Äù in a large variable that contains many instances of ‚Äúbadstring‚Äù) and that work takes a significant amount of time to complete. No crash or any other abnormality in the execution flow occurred, the delayed response was directly proportional to the rules, the input provided, and the hardware resources available. Because of the single match implementation in 2.x, this behavior did not reproduce there (as we would stop matching once the first instance was found).

In our response we explained several things:

* The difference in behavior between 2.x and libModSecurity and why processing that request with that rule together takes as long as it does.
* We acknowledge that the lack of documentation for this change in behavior means that the above point is not immediately obvious to a rule writer.
* We don‚Äôt consider this a DoS vulnerability (as the engine is doing exactly the amount of work it was asked to do).
* Due to the above-mentioned internal discussions, the behavior of the @rx operator will be returned to single matching behavior in the upcoming version, so his concerns would be alleviated. However, due to certain use cases, global matching will actually be added back to the engine in addition to single matching.
* Because we do not consider this a vulnerability, we will not be issuing an urgent security release to address this.
* We proposed an alternative way to rewrite potentially problematic rules such that they don‚Äôt perform global matching.

The researcher indicated that they were dissatisfied with our response and approached the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) team who reserved a CVE for this issue and continued the discussion with us. We explained the above chain of events, as well as our views and proposed alternative, but the CRS team insisted that whether or not the change was well-documented, they consider the change in behavior from 2.x to 3.x as a high severity security vulnerability.

At this point, we were at an impasse. The purpose of libModSecurity was to make a better version of ModSecurity 2.x, not re-create the exact same engine in every aspect. We try to retain backward compatibility whenever possible, but sometimes that is not possible, other times it is not the best approach. With the @rx operator we did end up deciding to go back to the old behavior and split the global matching off to an operator of its own, but that was done after weighing the performance benefits of the change (with performance still being a top priority for libModSecurity) against the cost of introducing a new operator, which adds levels of complexity and confusion for rule writers and landing on the side of performance.

Given that we could not reach an agreement, the CRS team insisted on a security release by September 13th to address what they considered to be a high severity vulnerability. Since we do not consider this a vulnerability and do not intend on making a security release for it, we submitted a [dispute](https://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#disputed_signify_in_cve_entry) for the reserved CVE, which indicates a disagreement between the vulnerability reporter and the software developer and encourages users to research the topic.

The CRS team‚Äôs concerns could also be addressed through the rule language itself. They could release their own update which would make sure CRS rules are not subject to such performance issues. Addressing this through the rules would allow the CRS team to resolve what they consider to be an urgent issue as quickly as they see fit. We on the ModSecurity side would make our own release per our original schedule, based on the risk as we see it (which, once more, does not warrant such urgency).

It‚Äôs important to note that while we are disputing this CVE, we welcome this dialogue as it reminds admins of all walks that regular expressions can be a minefield if not understood and properly used.

### How to Avoid Taxing Your ModSecurity Regular Expressions

This section will cover options for how to put some constraints on ModSecurity‚Äôs rule processing in general and regular expressions in particular. These will help address the above-described issues for anyone concerned, and, depending on one‚Äôs environment, might generally be good practices to reduce performance costs for ModSecurity.

Before we get to these, it‚Äôs worth noting that not all rules that use the @rx operator are likely to be of equal relevance to this discussion:

* Since the resource consumption under discussion here relates to long strings, portions of an HTTP request that are typically limited in length by the web server are unlikely to cause notable delays. Examples include query arguments and request headers. Regular expressions that attempt to match content from the request body, on the other hand, are more likely to see an effect.
* If a request is a result of a malicious actor, it‚Äôs difficult to achieve excessive resource consumption unless the payload is crafted against a particular rule. To that end, rule sets that are publicly visible ‚Äì such as CRS ‚Äì are more likely to be at risk than non-public rule sets that you may be using, or custom rules that you have written yourself.

**Option #1: Reject requests with very large argument sizes**

For most common use-cases, the size of arguments should not be ‚Äúvery large‚Äù, in order to trigger issues like the above-described we typically require a payload of over 100k in size (we say ‚Äútypically‚Äù because performance is always affected by hardware so we can‚Äôt provide exact numbers that will be accurate for every environment).

One can limit the size of the overall arguments in a given request by using a variable in ModSecurity called [‚ÄúARGS\_COMBINED\_SIZE‚Äù](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#ARGS_COMBINED_SIZE) , for example:

`SecRule ARGS_COMBINED_SIZE "@gt 64000" "id:1,phase:2,deny,status:403,msg:'Arguments size too large'"`

**Option #2: Reject requests containing an argument that is very large in size**

Similar to the above, you can use the [length](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#length) transformation in order to check each argument‚Äôs size and reject any arguments that exceed a chosen limit.

`SecRule ARGS "@gt 10000" "t:length,id:2,phase:2,deny,status:403,msg:'Single argument size exceeded'"`

Note that if you have a single argument that you expect to exceed that limit (we‚Äôll call it ‚Äúbigarg‚Äù) and you wish to still allow the request, you could exclude it from such logic:

`SecRule ARGS|!ARGS:bigarg "@gt 1000" "t:length,id:3,phase:2,deny,status:403,msg:'Single argument except for bigarg size exceeded"`

‚Ä¶ just make sure that you don‚Äôt test that argument against monstrous regular expressions. This is generally good advice regardless of any of the above.

**Option #3: Write your regular expressions to force single matching behavior**

Any global-matching regular expression could be adapted to only perform a single match by appending the ‚Äú.\*‚Äù characters at the end of the expression you would like to match. For example, if the original rule looks for:

`SecRule ARGS:somearg "@rx test" ‚Äúid:4,phase:2,deny,status:403"`

And the input is:

`somearg=test_test_test_moredata`

Global matching will find the first occurrence of ‚Äútest‚Äù, then continue at position 4 of the string to find the next occurrence of ‚Äútest‚Äù, and repeat once more at position 9, it will then find the last occurrence and at position 14 there will be no more matches and the search will stop.

The same rule could be written this way:

`SecRule ARGS:somearg "@rx test.*" "id:4,phase:2,deny,status:403"`

Given the same input as the above, the @rx operator will now find the first occurrence of ‚Äútest‚Äù as well as the rest of the string (since .\* means ‚Äúany number of any characters‚Äù), so the next lookup will attempt to begin at position 23 and find that it is the end of the string, and the search will stop.

There are many other ways to limit excessive processing of regular expressions and arguments in general in ModSecurity, some will make more sense than others depending on the environment. ModSecurity strives to be the ‚ÄúSwiss army knife‚Äù of WAFs, and like a Swiss army knife it has many tools, you just have to pick the one that best suits the task at hand.

# Addressing a DoS Vulnerability (CVE-2020-15598) in ModSecurity

Published September 14, 2020

*[**Editor**¬†‚Äì The [NGINX ModSecurity WAF](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/modules/nginx-waf/) module for NGINX¬†Plus officially went End-of-Sale as of April 1, 2022 and is transitioning to End-of-Life effective March 31, 2024. For more details, see [F5 NGINX ModSecurity WAF Is Transitioning to End-of-Life<.htmla> on our blog.]](f5-nginx-modsecurity-waf-transitioning-to-eol)*

On 14 September 2020, the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) team [published details of a vulnerability in ModSecurity](https://coreruleset.org/20200914/cve-2020-15598/). The vulnerability has been assigned the identifier [CVE-2020-15598](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15598), but details have not been published as of this writing. [The nature of the issue is disputed by Trustwave](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/modsecurity-regular-expressions-and-disputed-cve-2020-15598/), the maintainer of the ModSecurity project, who has proposed mitigations for the problematic behavior.

The issue can affect the [NGINX ModSecurity WAF](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/modules/nginx-waf/) module for NGINX¬†Plus, which is based on the current ModSecurity¬†3.0.4 release. The NGINX team at F5 worked with the reporter and has validated and applied their recommended update to recent releases of NGINX ModSecurity WAF (for NGINX Plus R20, R21, and R22).

For more details on the issue, please refer to the following resources:

* OWASP CRS team: [CVE-2020-15598¬†‚Äì ModSecurity v3 Affected By DoS (Severity HIGH)](https://coreruleset.org/20200914/cve-2020-15598/)
* Trustwave: [ModSecurity, Regular Expressions and Disputed CVE-2020-15598](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/modsecurity-regular-expressions-and-disputed-cve-2020-15598/)
* Mitre.org: [CVE-2020-15598](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15598) (currently reserved, not published)

The NGINX product team at F5 is grateful to [Christian¬†Folini](https://coreruleset.org/author/christian-folini/) at NetNEA and CRS developer [Ervin¬†Heged√ºs](https://twitter.com/IamAirWeen) for their support to create a patch for NGINX ModSecurity WAF. We strongly encourage NGINX¬†Plus subscribers to upgrade their NGINX ModSecurity WAF module to the latest version for NGINX Plus R20, R21, or R22.

Subscribers who are running versions 20-1.0.0-12, 21-1.0.1-2, or 22-1.0.1-2 or later of the nginx-plus-module-modsecurity package are protected from this issue. To confirm the installed version, you can run the following command:

* Ubuntu and related platforms:
```
# apt list --installed nginx-plus-module-modsecurityListing... Done
nginx-plus-module-modsecurity/stable,now 22+1.0.1-2~focal amd64 [installed]
```
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux and related platforms:

  ```
  # yum list --installed nginx-plus-module-modsecuritynginx-plus-module-modsecurity.x86_64  22+1.0.1-2.el8.ngx    @nginx-plus
  ```

Please reach out to your NGINX support representative at F5 if you require any assistance.

If using a private, open source build of ModSecurity, refer to the official Trustwave SpiderLabs [ModSecurity repository](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/releases) on GitHub, consider the [alternative mitigations proposed by Trustwave](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/modsecurity-regular-expressions-and-disputed-cve-2020-15598/), and evaluate the patch provided by the [OWASP CRS team](https://coreruleset.org/20200914/cve-2020-15598/). If you use ModSecurity from another source, please contact the maintainer of that source or consider the mitigations described by the OWASP CRS team and TrustWave.

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) team has identified a Denial of Service vulnerability in the underlying ModSecurity engine. This affects all releases in the ModSecurity v3 release line. The vendor Trustwave Spiderlabs did not release an update yet. However, we are providing users with a patch for ModSecurity and a workaround if they can not patch. Likewise, we are coordinating the patching with the Linux distributors.

This blog post tries to give you a comprehensive overview of the problem with all the resources you need to cope with the situation.

This is what you will find here:

### Official Advisory for CVE-2020-15598

ModSecurity v3.0.x is affected by a Denial of Service vulnerability due to the global matching of regular expressions. The combination of a non-anchored regular expression and the ModSecurity ‚Äúcapture‚Äù action can be exploited via a specially crafted payload.

While ModSecurity v2.x used to quit the execution of a regular expression after the first match. ModSecurity v3.0.x silently changed the behavior to global matching. This results in a DoS for existing non-anchored regexes containing the ‚Äúcapture‚Äù action. It also fills the TX variable space beyond the documented limit of 10 instances. The defense is handicapped due to the absence of the SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit directive. The vendor Trustwave Spiderlabs dropped this functionality for ModSecurity v3.

The vendor did not publish a new release, but there is a patch that brings back the former behavior.

### Video of the PoC (we are not sharing an exploit though)

While we are not sharing an exploit, here is a video demonstrating a proof of concept attack. This is a python script killing an NGINX server running ModSecurity v3 and CRS3.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

Please note that this was a script using ten threads and NGINX runs on 8 cores. The payload is about 700K per request and the server becomes unresponsive within seconds. A positive observation is that the server recovers relatively fast once the attack stops.

### Description of the Problem

Let us give you a detailed look into this problem. It may be worth to take a seat, this is going to take a while.

Consider the following ModSecurity rule:

```
SecRule ARGS "@rx \d" "id:1000,phase:2,deny,capture,log,msg:'Numeric payload'"

```

For those not familiar with ModSecurity rules, this tells the engine to inspect all GET and POST parameters and look for digits (-> `\d`). If there is one in any of the payloads, the request is blocked, and the match is written into a transaction variable (TX.0) thanks to the capture action.

And now we send the following payload, apparently expecting a match.

```
foo=123456789012345

```

The operator `@rx` will execute the regular expression `\d` and look for a match. What happens after match is not identical across various different ModSecurity versions, though:

**ModSecurity v2.x**: operator matches at ‚Äú1‚Äù, transaction variable `TX.0` filled with ‚Äú1‚Äù, remaining payload is dropped, no additional `TX` variables filled, rule execution aborts and request is being blocked.

**ModSecurity v3.x**: operator matches at ‚Äú1‚Äù, `TX.0` filled with ‚Äú1‚Äù, remaining payload is used for new regular expression match, operator matches at ‚Äú2‚Äù, `TX.1` filled with ‚Äú2‚Äù, remaining payload is used for new regular expression match, operator matches at ‚Äú3‚Äù, `TX.2` filled with ‚Äú3‚Äù, remaining payload is used for new regular expression match, ‚Ä¶ and so on until `TX.14` is filled with ‚Äú5‚Äù and there is no payload remaining anymore, rule execution comes to an end and the request is being blocked.

So our reference platform ModSecurity v2 stops the execution of the regular expression after the first match. ModSecurity v3, which we also try to support as good as we can, continues to execute the regular expression again and again until the whole payload is consumed. In the regex world, this is called global matching.

Essentially, ModSecurity v3 is executing the following code:

```
do { rc = pcre_exec(m_pc, ‚Ä¶) ‚Ä¶ } while (rc > 0)

```

This does not make any sense at all in this situation, since the first match will lead to a blockade and all remaining matches are going to be ignored. Also, there is no need to fill the additional transaction variables as no other rule is going to look at them after the deny. So the while loop should simply abort after the first match.

**This repetitive and futile call of the regular expression execution function leads to a DoS.** In the video above, the payload was fairly big, but the deciding factor is the number of matches: the number of transaction variables that are being written.

Global regular expression matching was introduced silently with the release of ModSecurity v3. ModSecurity v2 does not do global matching. The ModSecurity v2 Reference Manual does not mention global matching anywhere and all but two instances of all the ‚Äúcapture‚Äù rules in the manual are affected by this vulnerability unless they are rewritten to avoid it. (For the record: This has not happened).

Documentation is lacking with ModSecurity v3. A sign of this is that there is no reference manual for v3 and there was no announcement (or release notes) that mention this fundamental change in the behavior of the regular expression matching.

When CRS developer Ervin Heged√ºs contacted Trustwave with information about this vulnerability, Trustwave refused to acknowledge a security problem despite the devastating effect on a server. Instead they claimed it was the more natural form of behavior and that the rules should be adopted. But they also reverted to the old behavior - mostly that is. However, they did this for the ModSecurity v3.1 development tree. Trustwave has refused to backport the fix and they stated clearly that they will not release a new minor version (ModSecurity 3.0.5) with this security fix.

The fixed behavior in the development tree is still not 100% the same as ModSecurity v2. That version supports ten transaction variables that can be captured in the regular expressions. If you define more than ten in your regex, ModSecurity will simply ignore the capture completely (unfortunately without writing an error message). The patched ModSecurity v3 does more than ten matches if your regular expression comes with more than ten sub-groups (e.g. `(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)`) and fills the variables as requested in the rule. We do not really see a security problem connected with this behavior, but we are troubled it is non-documented behavior: It is different than the description of the capture action and the `TX` variables in the last version of the online reference manual.

Our reference platform ModSecurity v2 also features a directive that allows you to limit the size of the incoming requests for file uploads and form submissions separately (`SecRequestBodyLimit` vs. `SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit`). The latter directive could be useful to limit the impact of this vulnerability while still allowing larger file uploads. Unfortunately, this directive was dropped for ModSecurity v3 and the vendor Trustwave refused re-implement it for v3 (see here for a [conversation on this](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/pull/2265) and an alternative proposal by Trustwave that would not help much in this situation). We see this as a major shortcoming as `SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit` is a useful tool in DoS situations when you want to leave large file uploads intact, but limit the size of form submissions.

We can thus conclude this is a ModSecurity v3 DoS vulnerability. But how does it impact CRS? It impacts CRS a big deal because a lot of CRS3 rules are affected. We have working exploit payloads for three of them, but we consider a total of 58 rules of the default installation to be vulnerable. This is about a third of the default rules.

While it may be theoretically possible to rewrite the rules by anchoring them, performance and especially the readability of the rules would suffer. And despite our rules being very hard to read already, we have no intention to worsen this problem by anchoring everything. And there are cases where an anchored rule design would be impossible. Instead, we think that a security fix in the form of ModSecurity 3.0.5 is due.

Unfortunately, Trustwave Spiderlabs refuses to release despite having fixed the code already. This shifts the burden from the vendor to the users and we think this is wrong. That‚Äôs why we will tryeverything to make it easier for users to cope with this challenge.

### Patch for ModSecurity 3.0.4

Since Trustwave does not want to release a new version, we are providing you with a backported patch for the vanilla ModSecurity 3.0.4. Please note that this is the patch that the Debian packaging team as well as NGINX will be using for their security updates.

[cve-2020-15598.patch](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/crsgists/0e1f6f7f1bd1f239ded64cecee46a11d/raw/181bc852065e9782367f1dc67c96d4d250e73a46/cve-2020-15598.patch)

This patch is a backport of the git commit, that brings back the former behavior of the regular expression matching. As such, the patch is copyrighted 2020 by Trustwave Spiderlabs but we release it here thanks to the Apache license of the code.

Debian has applied this patch and they are updating the binaries. The NGINX team at F5 provides a supported build of ModSecurity for NGINX Plus. They have tested and applied the patch and made updated ModSecurity builds available for NGINX Plus subscribers. So if you are using any of these, you should be covered with a simple update. If you need to compile it yourself, here are the instructions for the patching of ModSecurity 3.0.4:

```
‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ download src and checking of signature
‚Ä¶
$> tar xvzf modsecurity-v3.0.4.tar.gz
$> cd modsecurity-v3.0.4
$> wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/crsgists/0e1f6f7f1bd1f239ded64cecee46a11d/raw/181bc852065e9782367f1dc67c96d4d250e73a46/cve-2020-15598.patch
$> patch -p1 < cve-2020-15598.patch

```

After this, the sources are ready for compilation. Follow any of the online recipes to do so. Here is one at [netnea](https://www.netnea.com/cms/nginx-tutorial-6_embedding-modsecurity).

### A (limited) Workaround for CRS3

CRS depends on regular expression matching a lot and the inspection of payload parameters is necessarily a primary focus for a web application firewall. We do not use the capture action everywhere, but most of the regular expressions are not anchored. Readability is a major reason for this.

With that being said, we identified 58 rules that are likely to be affected by this DoS vulnerability in the underlying ModSecurity v3 engine. Trustwave asked us to rewrite our rules to cope with their silent change of behavior (that they since reverted). We have no inclination to do so, however.

But what do you do, when updating / patching ModSecurity is not an option for you? You could disable all the CRS rules that are affected by this. But we advise you to ignore this option, since you would disable too many important rules and end up with a stripped down CRS3 leaving you with a lot of false negatives.

As explained above, the directive SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit could be useful as a mitigation tactic, but it is not supported in ModSecurity v3. But we can try to implement a recipe that performs something along those lines. Unfortunately, this only works as a mitigation, when you do not have large POST requests.

```
# Defense against CVE-2020-15598
#
# Make sure to set blocking or non-blocking in first rule
# and then limit (in bytes) in third and fourth rule.
#
# Place recipe before CRS include in your configuration.
#
# See https://coreruleset.org/20200914/cve-2020-15598/ for more infos
#
SecAction "id:1000,phase:1,pass,nolog,setvar:tx.cve_size_counter=0,setvar:tx.cveblock=0"
SecRule ARGS|ARGS_NAMES "@unconditionalMatch" "id:1001,phase:2,pass,nolog,t:length,setvar:'tx.cve_size_counter=+%{MATCHED_VAR}'"
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Content-Type "(?:application(?:/soap+|/)|text/)xml" "id:1002,phase:2,pass,nolog,chain"
   SecRule REQUEST_BODY "@unconditionalMatch" "t:length,setvar:'tx.cve_size_counter=+%{MATCHED_VAR}'"
SecRule TX:cve_size_counter "@gt 10000" "id:1010,phase:2,deny,log,msg:'ARGS size exceeded. Blocking request to mitigate CVE-2020-15598',chain"
   SecRule TX:cveblock "@eq 1" "t:none"
SecRule TX:cve_size_counter "@gt 10000" "id:1011,phase:2,pass,log,msg:'ARGS size exceeded. This could be attack via CVE-2020-15598 (or size limit too low).'"

```

It is probably worth to describe what we are doing here a bit. I won‚Äôt go into the details of ModSecurity rule writing, but there are a few pecularities of this recipe that are worth noting.

In rule 1000, we initialize a counter and we define if this recipe should be blocking or not (`tx.cveblock`). By default, it is in monitoring mode. Rule 1001 counts the length of all argument names and all argument values and adds them to the counter. We do this via the length transformation (`t:length`). We could also pick up the value of the Content-Length request header, but here we prefer to go with the actual parameters and their length.

The problem with this argument name and argument value counter is that it does not cover all the arguments. Some are missing in the ARGS collection. An XML request is handled by the XML parser and the result is served to ModSecurity via a tree that can be addressed via the XPath. The individual leaves of the tree are not added to the ARGS collection though. XPath is your only way to iterate them. An XML payload could thus be used to bypass our argument counter (Please note that unlike XML, JSON arguments are added to the ARGS collection). If there is no XML, one can simply deny it. But if we have to assume there might be XML, we need to count it too. We could turn to the Content-Length again, but let‚Äôs not trust that too much. Unfortunately, we can not simply iterate over the XPath tree: since XML is hierarchical, there is data that we would get multiple times in case the XML was nested. So instead, we take the size (length!) of the REQUEST\_BODY. In ModSecurity2, the REQUEST\_BODY is consumed by the XML body processor and it is thus no longer accessible. In ModSecurity3, however, this is another undocumented deviation from ModSecurity2: REQUEST\_BODY is accessible after the body processor has finished. In rule 1002, we take advantage of this implementation oddity in ModSecurity3 (the rule won‚Äôt work in ModSecurity2, but it is simply ignored silently).

Finally, 1010 and 1011 check the size of the length counter and they block the request or at least report the rule violation - both depending on the variable initialized in the first rule of the recipe.

It is hard to tell if you should install these rules on your server right away. You should definitely know the size of your POST requests before you do. Then it‚Äôs probably best to set the rule set in monitoring mode and let it run and only if you encounter a DoS to actually set it to blocking. For one thing must be clear: A single request triggering this rule is more a sign of a large POST request in your application than of a DoS attack. It‚Äôs only if you have so many of them that they actually take down your server that you can be sure it‚Äôs a DoS attack. If that happens, install this recipe, put it into blocking mode in rule 1000 and adjust the maximum size of the POST request in rule 1010 and 1011 (in bytes).

## Timeline of Our Conversation With the ModSecurity Vendor Trustwave Spiderlabs

We‚Äôd rather not go into the details of our conversation with Trustwave Spiderlabs about this weakness. We reported this to the vendor Trustwave immediately after our discovery. That was 91 days ago as of this writing. Trustwave responded that they do not see the new behavior as a vulnerability. Subsequently we declared that we would wait for the standard 90 days (that Trustwave sees as normal grace period before a disclosure) and would then disclose, asking Trustwave to fix the problem and release an update for ModSecurity v3.0 (-> ModSecurity 3.0.5) in the meantime. However, they responded they would only release this together with v3.1.0. This conversation continued, but we did not really get anywhere:

* 2020-06-15 : CRS team: Initial report by Ervin Heged√ºs
* 2020-06-23 : TW Spiderlabs: This is not a vulnerability, DoS unlikely, but we revert the behavior
* 2020-06-26 : CRS team: DoS is very simple here, see video, please release a fix
* 2020-06-29 : TW Spiderlabs: Please send PoC exploit
* 2020-06-29 : CRS team: PoC exploit
* 2020-07-06 : TW Spiderlabs: This is not a security issue, please continue discussion on github
* 2020-07-08 : CRS team: We consider this a security issue, we reserved a CVE and we‚Äôll disclose 90 days after initial report, please release ModSecurity v3 update before that date
* 2020-08-10 : TW Spiderlabs: If it‚Äôs a security issue, it might be one for CRS, we won‚Äôt do a release and we will dispute CVE
* 2020-08-25 : CRS team: We are open for discussion, but please publish a fixed ModSecurity v3
* 2020-09-09 : TW Spiderlabs: This is not a vulnerability, so we will not perform an update. If you are concerned, then you should issue an update for CRS

The exchange has been friendly and professional and there is little to complain about in terms of responsiveness. We just disagree whether this is a vulnerability or not. And asking us to re-design up to 60 regular expressions after the underlying engine silently changed its behavior is overly demanding - not the least because the code has been reverted to the previous behavior and this laborious exercise would be futile in the long run.
