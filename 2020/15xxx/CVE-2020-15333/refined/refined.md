- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zyxel CNM SecuManager software has predefined passwords for administrative accounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software uses hardcoded passwords for admin accounts, which are stored in the database. This makes it easier for an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain administrative access to the system using the predefined passwords, potentially leading to full control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could access the system by attempting to log in using the hardcoded credentials or by retrieving them through other vulnerabilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the system and knowledge of the hardcoded credentials.
