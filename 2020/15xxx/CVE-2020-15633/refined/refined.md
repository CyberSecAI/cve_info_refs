Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15633

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect string matching logic within the handling of HNAP requests in D-Link routers. Specifically, the issue is triggered by appending `?GetCAPTCHAsetting` to the end of an HTTP request to the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass authentication due to the flawed string matching logic when accessing protected pages.
*   **Incorrect String Matching Logic:** The core of the problem lies in how the router software processes the HNAP requests, allowing the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to escalate their privileges on the affected router.
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute code in the context of the router, potentially leading to complete compromise of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Adjacent Attack:** The attack can be performed by an attacker who is on the same network as the vulnerable router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target router.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to have valid credentials, since the bypass occurs due to flawed logic.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or modify an HTTP request to append the specific string to bypass the authentication.

**Affected Products:**

*   D-Link DIR-867 (All Ax Hardware Revisions, Firmware v1.20B10 and below)
*   D-Link DIR-878 (All Ax Hardware Revisions, Firmware v1.20B05 and below)
*   D-Link DIR-882-US (All Ax Hardware Revisions, Firmware v1.30B10 and below - Under Investigation)

**Mitigation:**
*   D-Link has released firmware updates (beta/hotfix versions) for DIR-867 and DIR-878 to address this issue. Users are advised to update their firmware to the latest versions.
*   The DIR-882-US is still under investigation, and users should monitor for further updates.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by chung96vn of Vietnam Cyber Security Center working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.8, indicating a high severity.
