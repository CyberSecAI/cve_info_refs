  "summary": "The provided content discusses CVE-2020-15658, which involves an issue with file downloads not properly handling special characters, leading to a file type mismatch when saved to disk.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the code for downloading files not properly handling special characters, specifically null characters, in the filename provided via the `a.download` attribute. This leads to an attacker being able to cut off the file ending at an earlier position, causing a different file type to be downloaded than shown in the dialog.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of special characters (null byte) in filename strings during file downloads",
      "File type spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious download filename using null characters, causing a user to download a file type other than what is displayed in the prompt. This could lead to unexpected code execution or other security risks if the user opens the downloaded file without verifying its type.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious website with client-side download that uses null characters in the `a.download` attribute",
         "Social engineering techniques"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the download filename presented to the user, usually via a crafted website with a client-side download.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered via the HTML `a.download` attribute when the user attempts to download a file. The issue is that the filename is not properly sanitized, leading to a file type spoofing vulnerability. The bug report also notes that on macOS, the file save dialog can show the wrong file type (e.g., CSV file) when the filename contains null characters, further adding to the confusion. The fix involves replacing any null characters with an underscore, so the final name is correct. A test case was added to prevent regression."
