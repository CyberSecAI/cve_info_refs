Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Net-SNMP's improper handling of symbolic links (symlinks) when loading MIB files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symlink Following:** The `snmpd` daemon, which runs as a low-privileged user, incorrectly handles symlinks when loading MIB files. This allows an attacker to potentially redirect the daemon to access or modify files outside of its intended scope.
- **MIB Index Caching:** The `snmpd` daemon caches the MIB directory, and this caching mechanism was vulnerable to symlink manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the symlink following vulnerability, a low-privileged user can potentially elevate their privileges to root.
- **Sensitive Information Access:** The attacker could use this to access sensitive information stored on the system that the `snmpd` user should not have access to.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In combination with other vulnerabilities, this symlink issue could be a component of a larger exploit that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker with local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Symlink Manipulation:** The attacker would need to create malicious symlinks pointing to locations on the file system that the `snmpd` user does not have permission to access.
- **File System Access:** This vulnerability occurs during the loading of MIB files, meaning the attacker needs to be able to influence the MIB loading process. In combination with a package like `snmp-mibs-downloader`, the attacker may be able to control where the MIB files are installed and thus exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the target system.
- **File system manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks in locations that are accessible to the `snmpd` process.
- **Understanding of MIB loading:** The attacker needs an understanding of how Net-SNMP loads MIB files to exploit the symlink vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tobias Neitzel of usd AG.
- The fix involves preventing the `snmpd` daemon from caching the MIB directory, thus preventing the symlink following.
- The issue is related to how `snmpd` reads the content of mib\_indexes/\* files. The fix removes the reading and writing of the mib\_indexes/\* files

The provided information also shows that fixes were released for various distributions, including Debian and Ubuntu, to address this vulnerability.
