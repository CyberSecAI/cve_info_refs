  "CVE-2020-15863": {
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the XGMAC NIC device of the QEMU emulator. This flaw occurs during packet transmission and affects the highbank and midway ARM emulated machines. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process. The vulnerability exists in the xgmac_enet_send() function in hw/net/xgmac.c due to missing break statements and improper checking of the buffer size.",
