Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:

1.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** IObit Malware Fighter (MF) uses delete oplocks, which allows any user to trigger the deletion of a file handled by MF with SYSTEM privileges. This is because when a file is detected as malicious and the "delete automatically" option is enabled, the file deletion is not immediate, but occurs after a short delay. During this delay, a regular user can gain control over the file via a symlink and cause the deletion of an arbitrary file by MF with SYSTEM privileges.
2.  **Configuration File Manipulation:**  The configuration file "config.ini", located in "C:\ProgramData\IObit\IObit Malware Fighter", stores MF's settings. This file is writable by regular users but not deletable or writeable in place. However, the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability can be used to remove the configuration file.
3.  **Lack of Input Validation:**  MF reads configuration settings from the config.ini file without proper validation allowing an attacker to disable all protection features by writing a crafted config file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion via Oplocks:** The use of delete oplocks without proper handling enables a regular user to delete files with SYSTEM privileges by setting up a symlink before the file gets deleted.
*   **Unrestricted Configuration File Access:** The fact that a regular user can overwrite the configuration settings after deleting the original config file allows the attacker to disable all protection settings.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checks:** There are no integrity checks in place for the configuration file, allowing an attacker to modify it and disable the AV.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disabling Antivirus Features:** An attacker can completely disable all of IObit Malware Fighter's protection features by setting the “ConfigType” value to "560" in the configuration file.
*   **Deletion of Critical Files:** By exploiting the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability, an attacker can delete arbitrary files, including critical system files (such as Windows Defender executables), and IObit Malware Fighter’s own executables rendering the system vulnerable.
*   **Persistence:** The attacker can also remove the whitelist configurations to ensure no files are excluded from scanning.
*  **System Compromise:**  The attacker can remove both IObit and Windows Defender making the system completely unprotected from malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious File Detection:** The attack begins by introducing a malicious file, which will be detected by the antivirus software.
2.  **File Deletion Trigger:** Trigger the file deletion. This can happen automatically after detection or by manually initiating deletion.
3.  **Symlink Creation:** Before the actual deletion occurs, the attacker creates a symlink to a target file.
4. **Configuration File Manipulation**: Once an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability is exploited to remove the config file, a new crafted config file with disabled protection settings can be written.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a regular user on the target system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to create files and directories, and set up symlinks.
*   **Ability to trigger the AV scan:** The attacker needs to trigger the AV to detect a file and start the deletion process.
