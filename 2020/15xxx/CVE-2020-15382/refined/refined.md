- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Brocade SANnav application uses a hard-coded administrator account with the weak password `passw0rd` if a password is not provided for PostgreSQL at install time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded credentials, use of a weak password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL database, potentially leading to full system compromise due to the high privileges associated with the administrator account.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the vulnerable system where the Brocade SANnav application is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the system hosting the vulnerable application. The attacker would need to know that the default password was in use which is likely to be the case if the PostgreSQL password was not set at install time, as stated.
