- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_mail_autoreply.php` file within CentOS Web Panel. The application fails to properly sanitize the `user` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability. The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to sensitive information disclosure with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, requiring no authentication. An attacker can send a crafted request to `ajax_mail_autoreply.php` with a malicious payload in the `user` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No authentication is required.
