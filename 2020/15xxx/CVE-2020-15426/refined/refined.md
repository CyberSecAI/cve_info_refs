- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input within the `serverip` parameter in `ajax_migration_cpanel.php` before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection vulnerability. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the affected CentOS Web Panel installation with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without requiring authentication. By sending a crafted `serverip` parameter to the `ajax_migration_cpanel.php` file, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required for exploitation.
