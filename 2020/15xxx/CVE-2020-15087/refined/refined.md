Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15087:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when accessing internal APIs in Presto (now Trino) server installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users could bypass authorization checks, gaining unauthorized access to internal APIs.
- **Insecure Internal Communication:** The vulnerability is specifically related to instances where secure internal communication is enabled in a cluster.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and gain access to internal APIs, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack vector involves directly accessing internal APIs, which implies network access within the Trino cluster.
- **Authenticated Users:** The vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated users, meaning an attacker needs valid user credentials to exploit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Trino system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the internal APIs of the Trino coordinator and workers.
- **Secure Internal Communication Enabled:** The vulnerability is only exploitable when secure internal communication is configured for the Trino cluster.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability does *not* affect clients such as the CLI or JDBC driver.
- The issue was fixed in Trino version 337.
- Workarounds include blocking network access to internal APIs on the coordinator and workers.

This vulnerability allows an authenticated user with network access to internal APIs to bypass authorization checks and escalate privileges, thereby compromising the Trino server.
