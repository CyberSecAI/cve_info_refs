{
  "CVE-2020-15862": {
    "root_cause": "Improper Privilege Management in Net-SNMP due to SNMP WRITE access to the EXTEND MIB.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The EXTEND MIB allows running arbitrary commands as root via SNMP WRITE access.",
       "The snmpd daemon loads configuration files from /var/lib/snmp, which is writable by the Debian-snmp user, allowing the user to modify snmpd behavior",
      "The configuration file parameter wins over the command line -u flag, allowing an attacker to set the agentUser to root"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation to root, arbitrary command execution, potential for full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting SNMP WRITE access to the EXTEND MIB to create and execute arbitrary commands or shell scripts.",
      "Modifying configuration files within the /var/lib/snmp directory to set agentUser to root"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs SNMP WRITE access to the EXTEND MIB, which can be achieved by having the correct snmp community, or potentially being an user on the local system with that access.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in Net-SNMP versions through 5.8, the vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with SNMP write privileges, by setting configuration parameters or directly creating commands via the EXTEND mib."
