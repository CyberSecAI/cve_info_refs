Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox for iOS injects the `LoginsHelper.js` script, which is responsible for handling password autofill functionality. This script is injected at the `AtDocumentEnd` timing. This allows malicious web content to define a rogue `window.firefox.logins` object before the legitimate `LoginsHelper` is set, effectively overriding the intended functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Script Injection Timing:** The core issue lies in injecting `LoginsHelper.js` at `AtDocumentEnd` instead of `AtDocumentStart`. This creates a race condition where malicious scripts loaded in the page can define their own `window.firefox.logins` before the legitimate one is set.
*   **Lack of Mutability Control:** The vulnerability is further exacerbated because the rogue `window.firefox.logins` object is defined as immutable (using `Object.defineProperty` with `writable: false`), preventing the legitimate `LoginsHelper` from being set later.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** A malicious actor can inject a script that overrides the legitimate login helper. When a user attempts to save login credentials, the malicious script can intercept the credentials, leading to large-scale credential theft.
*   **Loss of User Trust:** Successful exploitation could erode user trust in the browser's ability to securely manage passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Ads:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into ads that are displayed on web pages.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can compromise legitimate websites and inject malicious code that overrides the `LoginsHelper`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject JavaScript:** An attacker needs to be able to inject and execute JavaScript code within the context of a web page visited by the victim. This can be achieved through malicious ads, or by compromising websites.
*   **No User Interaction Required (After Initial Setup):** Once the malicious script is loaded, user interaction is not needed to steal credentials when users attempt to save passwords.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Muneaki Nishimura.
*   The fix was implemented in [this commit](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/pull/7005).
*   The fix likely involved ensuring that the legitimate `LoginsHelper` is set at `AtDocumentStart` or by detecting whether other helper is already set before setting the legitimate one.
