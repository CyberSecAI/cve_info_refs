```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Zyxel CNM SecuManager software contains multiple backdoor APIs that can be accessed without authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated access to multiple API endpoints.",
        "Hardcoded credentials and keys are used in these APIs for communication with other components or services."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, modify system settings, or potentially perform remote code execution by leveraging the unsecured APIs. This would allow the attacker to bypass authentication and perform malicious actions on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through network access to the vulnerable API endpoints.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device."
