Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the `SSRSReport` class of Veeam ONE Reporter. Specifically, the software processes XML files for importing and exporting report templates without proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of XML input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code containing external entity references.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to disclose sensitive information by forcing the XML parser to access and embed the content of arbitrary URIs (including local files) back into the XML document, which is then processed further.
- **File Content Exposure:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose file contents in the context of the SYSTEM user, potentially gaining access to sensitive system information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by sending a specially crafted XML document within an HTTP request to the Veeam ONE Reporter web server (default port 1239).
- **Malicious XML Payload:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious XML document containing external entity references that point to the files they wish to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the Veeam ONE Reporter web server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the Veeam ONE system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of XML and XXE:** The attacker needs to be familiar with XML and XXE injection techniques to craft the malicious XML payload.

**Additional details from provided content:**

- The vulnerability is tracked as ZDI-CAN-10709 (CVE-2020-15418) and is part of a set of vulnerabilities that also includes ZDI-CAN-10710 (CVE-2020-15419).
- The vulnerability was discovered by rgod working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Hotfixes are available for Veeam ONE versions 10 (build 10.0.0.750) and 9.5 Update 4a (build 9.5.4.4587). The hotfixes are not compatible with version 9.5 Update 4 (build 9.5.4.4566), and users of this version are advised to upgrade before applying the fix.
