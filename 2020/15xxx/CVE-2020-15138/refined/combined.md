# XSS vulnerability in the Previewers plugin

High

[RunDevelopment](/RunDevelopment)
published
GHSA-wvhm-4hhf-97x9
Aug 6, 2020

## Package

npm

prismjs
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=1.1.0 <1.21.0

## Patched versions

1.21.0

## Description

### Impact

The easing preview of the Previewers plugin has an XSS vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in Safari and Internet Explorer.

This impacts all Safari and Internet Explorer users of Prism >=v1.1.0 that use the *Previewers* plugin (>=v1.10.0) or the *Previewer: Easing* plugin (v1.1.0 to v1.9.0).

### Patches

This problem is patched in v1.21.0.

### Workarounds

To workaround the issue without upgrading, [disable the easing preview](https://prismjs.com/plugins/previewers/#disabling-a-previewer) on all impacted code blocks. You need Prism v1.10.0 or newer to apply this workaround.

### References

The vulnerability was introduced by this [commit](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/commit/4303c940d3d3a20e8ce7635bf23331c75060f5c5) on Sep 29, 2015 and fixed by [Masato Kinugawa](https://twitter.com/kinugawamasato) ([#2506](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2506)).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/issues).

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15138

### Weaknesses

# How to use

You don't need to do anything. With this plugin loaded, a previewer will appear on hovering some values in code blocks.
The following previewers are supported:

* `angle` for angles
* `color` for colors
* `gradient` for gradients
* `easing` for easing functions
* `time` for durations

This plugin is compatible with CSS, Less, Markup attributes, Sass, Scss and Stylus.

# Examples

## CSS

```

	background: -webkit-linear-gradient(left,     #cb60b3 0%, #c146a1 50%, #a80077 51%, #db36a4 100%); /* Chrome10+, Safari5.1+ */

# Disabling a previewer

All previewers are enabled by default. To enable only a subset of them, a `data-previewers` attribute
can be added on a code block or any ancestor. Its value should be a space-separated list of previewers
representing the subset.

For example:

```
<pre class="language-css" data-previewers="color time"><code>div {
	/* Only the previewer for color and time are enabled */
	color: red;
	transition-duration: 1s;
	/* The previewer for angles is not enabled. */
	transform: rotate(10deg);
}</code></pre>
```

will give the following result:

```
div {
	/* Only the previewers for color and time are enabled */
	color: red;
	transition-duration: 1s;
	/* The previewer for angles is not enabled. */
	transform: rotate(10deg);
}
```

# API

This plugins provides a constructor that can be accessed through `Prism.plugins.Previewer`.

Once a previewer has been instantiated, an HTML element is appended to the document body.
This element will appear when specific tokens are hovered.

## `new Prism.plugins.Previewer(type, updater, supportedLanguages)`

* `type`: the token type this previewer is associated to.
  The previewer will be shown when hovering tokens of this type.
* `updater`: the function that will be called each time an associated token is hovered.
  This function takes the text content of the token as its only parameter.
  The previewer HTML element can be accessed through the keyword `this`.
  This function must return `true` for the previewer to be shown.
* `supportedLanguages`: an optional array of supported languages.
  The previewer will be available only for those.
  Defaults to `'*'`, which means every languages.
* `initializer`: an optional function.
  This function will be called when the previewer is initialized,
  right after the HTML element has been appended to the document body.
