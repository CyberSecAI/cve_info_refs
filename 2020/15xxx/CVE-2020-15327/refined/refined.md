{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ZODB (Zope Object Database) service runs without authentication, making it accessible over the network on port 8100/tcp.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open ZODB storage without authentication.",
      "World-readable `Data.fs` file containing sensitive information.",
       "World-readable blob directory."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access sensitive information including cookies, passwords, hashes, access control parameters, Python code, serialized Python variables, and logs from TR-069. Exposing this service on the WAN can lead to pre-auth RCE as the `axess` user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to port 8100/tcp.",
       "Access to the world-readable `/opt/axess/var/filestorage/Data.fs` file and the blob directory `/opt/axess/var/blobstorage`."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the device on port 8100, or the ability to read the files `Data.fs` and the content of the blob directory."
  }
