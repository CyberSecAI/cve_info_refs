### CVE-2020-15663
The provided content describes a downgrade attack vulnerability in the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which affects Windows operating systems.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes `updater.exe` from the install location with system privileges. The service verifies that `updater.exe` is signed by Mozilla, but it does not check the version. This allows an attacker to replace the current `updater.exe` with an older, vulnerable version.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of version check on `updater.exe` by the Mozilla Maintenance Service
    - Execution of `updater.exe` with SYSTEM privileges from a user-writable directory
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the target machine
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local attacker who has write access to the Firefox or Thunderbird installation directory
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to write to the Firefox or Thunderbird installation directory
    - Local access to the target machine.
- **Additional Information:**
    - The attacker can replace `updater.exe` and `updater.ini` with older, vulnerable versions to exploit known vulnerabilities, such as [Bug 1342742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742)
    - The vulnerability is triggered when the Mozilla Maintenance Service is started, which occurs during the update process
    - The fix involves limiting the install locations on which the maintenance service may be invoked
    - The issue is specific to Windows operating systems
    - The fix was implemented in Firefox 80, Firefox ESR 68.12, Firefox ESR 78.2, Thunderbird 68.12, and Thunderbird 78.2
