Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15258:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of Electron's `shell.openExternal()` function within the Wire Desktop application. The application directly passes user-provided URLs to `shell.openExternal()` without proper validation or sanitization. This function is intended to open external URLs in the user's default browser or associated application. However, it can also be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on the user's computer if malicious URLs are used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of URL Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of input validation on URLs passed to `shell.openExternal()`. This allows an attacker to supply URLs that trigger unintended actions.
*   **Protocol Handling:** `shell.openExternal()` doesn't restrict the protocols it opens, allowing access to protocols beyond `http(s)` which can lead to arbitrary code execution (e.g. `file:`, `smb:`, `ms-msdt:`, `search-ms:`, `jnlp:`).
*   **Operating System Differences**: The specific attack vectors available through `shell.openExternal()` vary across operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the victim's machine. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to the complete compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links:** The primary attack vector involves sending a message containing a malicious link to the victim via a conversation in the Wire application.
*   **Middle Click:** On certain operating systems (e.g., Linux)  the vulnerability is triggered by a middle-click on the malicious link.
*   **Network Shares:** SMB/CIFS protocol is used to execute code from a remote server. For example, a malicious `.desktop` file served via SMB can be executed on Linux systems.
*   **URI Scheme Handler Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited using registered URI scheme handlers (e.g., `ms-msdt:`, `search-ms:`, `jnlp:`) that might have vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the victim, which usually implies that they are connected to the same conversation on the Wire application.
*   **Payload Hosting:** The attacker needs a place to host their malicious payload. This could be a publicly accessible server or SMB share.
*   **Social Engineering:** While the attack can be initiated remotely by sending a message, some form of user interaction is required (e.g., middle-clicking a link, confirming dialogs/prompts). This often relies on deceiving users.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content goes into more depth than the original CVE description, detailing the various attack vectors on different operating systems, how `shell.openExternal()` is implemented across systems, and also includes details about the patch.

*   **Windows:** SMB shares can be used to execute remote executables. Microsoft Sysinternals Live is used as an example. The `ms-msdt:` protocol and `search-ms:` protocols are also mentioned as ways to execute arbitrary code.
*   **macOS:** SMB, AFP, and NFS can be used to execute remote files if the share is mounted. The automount feature in older macOS versions was also discussed.
*   **Linux:** While direct executable opening is often blocked, `.desktop` files from remote SMB shares can be executed on distributions like Xubuntu, resulting in code execution.
*   **Patch:** The patch implements an allowlist of allowed URL protocols (`http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`) within the `WindowUtil.ts` file. This prevents `shell.openExternal()` from being used with potentially dangerous protocols.
