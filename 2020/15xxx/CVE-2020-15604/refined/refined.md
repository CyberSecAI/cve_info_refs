Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **incomplete SSL server certificate validation** in the Trend Micro Security 2019 (v15) consumer product line's Active Update function. This incomplete validation is combined with another vulnerability related to improper update file verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incomplete SSL Server Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The software does not properly validate the SSL server certificate when communicating with the update server.
2.  **Improper Update File Verification (CWE-494):** The software does not properly verify the integrity of the downloaded update files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to trick an affected client into downloading a malicious update instead of a legitimate one.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is a **man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack**, where the attacker intercepts network communication between the client and the update server.
*   The attacker would need to position themselves in the network path, for example, by setting up a malicious wireless LAN access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the affected Trend Micro client and the update server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious update server and provide malicious updates that the vulnerable client will accept due to the incomplete validation.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious update file to be downloaded by the client.

**Affected Products:**

*   Trend Micro Premium Security 2019 (v15 and below) for Windows
*   Trend Micro Maximum Security 2019 (v15 and below) for Windows
*   Trend Micro Internet Security 2019 (v15 and below) for Windows
*   Trend Micro Antivirus+ 2019 (v15 and below) for Windows

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerabilities are addressed in Trend Micro Security versions 2020 (v16) and 2021 (v17). Users are advised to upgrade to the latest version to mitigate the risk.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is assigned two CVEs: CVE-2020-15604 (CWE-494) and CVE-2020-24560 (CWE-295).
*   The CVSS v3 score is 5.9 (Medium).
*   Trend Micro has not received any reports or is aware of any actual attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities at this time.
