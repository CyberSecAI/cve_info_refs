Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15492:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Startup TOOLS web application, specifically the `sut_srv.exe` process running on TCP port 85, fails to properly validate user input before using it in file system access. This lack of input validation allows for path traversal attacks.
*   The software utilizes PHP version 5.2.13, which is vulnerable to null-byte injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is the path traversal, allowing attackers to access files outside the intended web application directory.
*   **Log Poisoning:** The application's use of a vulnerable PHP version (5.2.13) makes it susceptible to null-byte injection. Attackers can inject malicious PHP code into the application's log files (`sut_server_.log`) and then execute this code by including the log file as a PHP script.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read any file on the server's file system that the web server has access to.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Through log poisoning and PHP code injection, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Because the service runs with `nt-authority\system` privileges by default, successful RCE will lead to the attacker having system-level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application (port 85).
*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../`) into the URL to access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same corporate network as the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL path that contains the vulnerable parameter (e.g., `/../../../../../../../windows/win.ini`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions a publicly available exploit written in Go for this vulnerability.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) URL is provided, demonstrating how to download the `C:\windows\win.ini` file.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Patrick Hener of SySS GmbH, with special credit to Dr. Benjamin He√ü for the log poisoning exploit method.
*   The vendor, INNEO Solutions GmbH, has addressed the vulnerability with a complete redesign of the application in version 6.x.x.x and recommends migration from the deprecated 2018 versions.
