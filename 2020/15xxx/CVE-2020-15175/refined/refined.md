Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15175:

**Description of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `pluginimage.send.php` endpoint of GLPI.  An attacker could craft malicious parameters to delete the `.htaccess` file located in the `files` directory.

**Root Cause:**

The `pluginimage.send.php` endpoint allows a user to specify an image from a plugin. The parameters were not properly validated, allowing for arbitrary file deletion.

**Impact:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Reading:** Successful exploitation allows any user to read all files and folders within the `/files/` directory.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The `/files/` directory contains sensitive information such as user sessions and logs.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially obtain an administrator's session token and use it to authenticate as an administrator.

**Attack Vector:**

By crafting a malicious request to `pluginimage.send.php`, an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the deletion of the `.htaccess` file.

**Affected Versions:**

GLPI versions >= 0.70 are affected.

**Patched Versions:**

The vulnerability is patched in GLPI version 9.5.2.

**Mitigation:**

The provided commit prevents:

*   Removal of any plugin file from unauthenticated user
*   Access to files outside plugins directories
