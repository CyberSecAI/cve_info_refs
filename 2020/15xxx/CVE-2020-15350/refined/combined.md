### Contribution description

* Cherry-picked [@mjurczak fix](https://github.com/mjurczak/RIOT/commit/d27b048c28ceb1e3d0e0b06faa2f77965b7784d9) for the decode buffer size estimation (which could result in a buffer overflow of up to one byte note being catched)
* Made using the API less pain by accepting `void` pointers for buffers (non-breaking change, as `unsigned char *` is implicitly casted to `void *`)
* Cleaned up the unit test to fix basic code quality issued
* Added a unit test to check the `base64_estimate_{de,en}code_size()`
* Added a benchmark for base64 (this will come in useful to review a follow up PR)

### Testing procedure

The unit tests should no detect an issue in `base64_estimate_{de,en}code_size()`

### Issues/PRs references

None

Sorry, something went wrong.

Should the benchmark have an automatic test?

It might be good to split the benchmark from this PR, that way this PR can limit itself to cleanups and the bugfix and can get in right away. But if you add the `01_test.py`script right away we can get everything in at once, I don't mind.

| Should the benchmark have an automatic test?  I'm not sure what an automatic test should do. A single benchmark run will provide a raw number, that lacks context. (Or two raw numbers, one for encode and one for decode.) IMO, at least a second benchmark result from the same hardware is needed to have any meaningful information.  What we could do (if we want to run automatic tests), is to feed a database with the raw results to see how performance changes over time. But maybe such considerations should be done independently form this PR and applied later on to all benchmarks. |

I was just thinking on the most basic check, what we do for other benches `tests/bench_xtimer/tests/01-run.py`, just a simple test that says "the application works". My comment comes mainly from the impression that we now ask for a `01-run.py` for new applications. |
