- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Trend Micro installer attempts to load DLL files from its current directory. This allows for the loading of an arbitrary DLL with the same privileges as the installer if run as Administrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted search path vulnerability, leading to remote code execution (RCE).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can run arbitrary code on a vulnerable system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer. The user would then need to open a malicious directory or device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer, and the user would need to interact with this directory. User interaction is required to open a malicious directory or device. The user would have to run the installer as administrator to allow the DLL to run with elevated privileges.
