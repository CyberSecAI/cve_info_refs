Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **improper access control** issue in the dashboard configuration form of the `dashproducts` module. Specifically, the code did not properly verify if a user had the necessary permissions to change the configuration settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing users to modify the dashboard configuration. This means that users without the necessary 'configure' permission could still potentially alter the settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker, or a user without the 'configure' permission, could potentially modify the dashboard settings. This might result in changes to displayed data, how the dashboard operates or potentially disrupt the intended behavior of the dashboard. The impact is described as "Improper access control WIP", suggesting that the complete ramifications might not have been fully explored or detailed at the time of the report.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the dashboard configuration form. A user who does not have the required configure permissions could attempt to modify the settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to have access to the dashboard interface and attempt to interact with the configuration form, despite not having the 'configure' permission.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version `2.1.0` of the `dashproducts` module.
*   The commit `f0799c13628a9b9ca6ca75c085b083d924a8ea7e` addresses this vulnerability by adding a permission check before rendering the configuration form and before saving the configuration.
*   The fix involves checking for the 'configure' permission using the `getPermission('configure')` function before displaying the configuration form, and before saving the configuration in `saveDashConfig` function. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing or altering the dashboard settings.
