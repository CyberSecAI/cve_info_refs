Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-15151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an observable timing discrepancy in how Magento (both OpenMage and Adobe versions) validates secret keys used for form protection. Specifically, the comparison of the provided secret key with the expected one was done using a direct string comparison (`!=`) instead of a timing-attack-safe comparison function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:**  The original comparison method using `!=` is susceptible to timing attacks. An attacker could observe the time it takes for the comparison to complete and deduce information about the secret key, character by character.
- **Bypassed Formkey Protection:** This vulnerability allows bypassing the form key protection mechanism, which is crucial for preventing CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Increased CSRF Attack Surface:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass form key validation, making the system vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Timing Analysis:** The attacker performs requests with varying secret keys, analyzes the response times and deduces the actual secret key used by the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the admin interface
- The attacker does not need administrative privileges but requires knowledge of form parameters that are protected by form key validation.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves changing the direct string comparison to use `hash_equals` in OpenMage and `Security::compareStrings` in Magento2 which are constant time comparison functions, mitigating the timing attack vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is similar to Adobe's CVE-2020-9690, which was also related to a timing discrepancy in signature verification in Magento.
- The affected versions include OpenMage versions prior to 19.4.6 and 20.0.2, and Magento 2 versions prior to 2.4.0, 2.3.5-p2.
