- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_crons.php` file. The application does not properly validate a user-supplied string in the `user` parameter before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection. The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of root. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, and authentication is not required. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request containing malicious input in the `user` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CentOS Web Panel server. No authentication is required.
