## Description

> ### Meta
>
> * CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (8.2)
> * CWE-325, CWE-20, CWE-200, CWE-502

### Problem

It has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described below.

* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007), [CVE-2020-15099](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099): Potential Privilege Escalation
  + the database server used for a TYPO3 installation must be accessible for an attacker (either via internet or shared hosting network)
  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (7.5, high)
* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013), [CVE-2016-5091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5091): Insecure Deserialization & Remote Code Execution
  + an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation
  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (9.1, critical)

The overall severity of this vulnerability is **high (8.2)** based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated).

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.20 or 10.4.6 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013: Missing Access Check in TYPO3 CMS

Categories:
[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Helmut Hummel

It has been discovered, that TYPO3 CMS lacks an access check for Extbase actions.

**Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS

**Release Date:** May 24, 2016

## Vulnerable subcomponent: Extbase

**Vulnerability Type:** Missing access check

**Affected Versions:** Versions 4.3.0 up to 8.1.0

**Severity:** Critical

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:O/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en)

**CVE:** CVE-2016-5091

**Problem Description**: Extbase request handling fails to implement a proper access check for requested controller/ action combinations, which makes it possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary Extbase actions by crafting a special request. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation. The missing access check inevitably leads to information disclosure or remote code execution, depending on the action that an attacker is able to execute.

**Solution:** Update to TYPO3 versions 6.2.24, 7.6.8 or 8.1.1 that fix the problem described.

**Alternative Solution:** Apply the [patches](/fileadmin/t3o_teams/security-team/bug76231/fix_76231.zip) suitable for your TYPO3 branch manually.

**Alternative Solution:** Download the [zip archive](/fileadmin/t3o_teams/security-team/bug76231/fix_76231.zip) which contains a folder with a script and patches for all affected TYPO3 versions. *(Please note: If you were quick and applied the zip file before the regression was fixed, you need to download this [undo zip archive](/fileadmin/t3o_teams/security-team/bug76231/fix_76231_v1-incl-undo-script.zip), which contains a script to revert the patches. After running the script, you have to use the script from above to secure your TYPO3 CMS instances.)*

**Notes:**TYPO3 installations with at least one publicly available Extbase action, are exploitable without any further authentication.

TYPO3 installations without publicly available Extbase actions, are still exploitable for authenticated backend users with access to a backend module, which is based on Extbase.

**Important Note:** The fix introduced changes in the internal request handling of Extbase. In case an such unlikely incompatibility with any extension (that relies on internal API) occurs, the TYPO3 installation still remains fully available and functional, with only little minor issues in Extbase form validation handling.

Users of **any** TYPO3 version from 4.3.0 to 8.1.0 are **strongly encouraged to upgrade** or to at least apply the patches provided below.

Please note, that patching a not supported TYPO3 version can be considered only as temporary mitigation. Upgrade to a supported versions should be performed as soon as possible.

**Credits:** Thanks to Stefan Horlacher from Arcus Security GmbH who discovered and reported the issue, Alex Kellner, who also reported the issue and Oliver Hader for discovering a related vulnerability.

**General Advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Opens external link in new window"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

**General Note:** All security related code changes are tagged so that you can easily look them up on our [review system](https://review.typo3.org/#/q/status:merged+project:Packages/TYPO3.CMS+topic:security,n,z).

Jul 28, 2020

## Package

composer

typo3/cms-core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 9.0.0 <= 9.5.19, >= 10.0.0 <= 10.4.5

## Patched versions

9.5.20, 10.4.6

## Description

> ### Meta
>
> * CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (8.2)
> * CWE-325, CWE-20, CWE-200, CWE-502

### Problem

It has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described below.

* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007), [CVE-2020-15099](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099): Potential Privilege Escalation
  + the database server used for a TYPO3 installation must be accessible for an attacker (either via internet or shared hosting network)
  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (7.5, high)
* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013), [CVE-2016-5091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5091): Insecure Deserialization & Remote Code Execution
  + an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation
  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (9.1, critical)

The overall severity of this vulnerability is **high (8.2)** based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated).

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.20 or 10.4.6 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.

# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-008: Sensitive Information Disclosure

Categories:
[Development](/help/security-advisories/development "Development")

Created by Oliver Hader

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to sensitive information disclosure.

* **Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS
* **Subcomponent:** Backend User Interface (ext:backend)
* **Release Date:** July 28, 2020
* **Vulnerability Type:** Sensitive Information Disclosure
* **Affected Versions:** 9.0.0-9.5.19, 10.0.0-10.4.5
* **Severity:** High
* **Suggested CVSS:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)
* **References:** [CVE-2020-15098](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15098), [CWE-325](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/325.html), [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html), [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html), [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)

### Problem Description

It has been discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described below.

* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007), [CVE-2020-15099](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099): **Potential Privilege Escalation**
  + the database server used for a TYPO3 installation must be accessible for an attacker (either via internet or shared hosting network)
  + CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (7.5, high)
* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013), [CVE-2016-5091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5091): **Insecure Deserialization & Remote Code Execution**
  + an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation
  + CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C (9.1, critical)

The overall severity of this vulnerability is **high (8.2)** based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated) to successfully exploit this vulnerability.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.20 or 10.4.6 that fix the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.

### General Advice

Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Security/Index.html#security). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

### General Note
