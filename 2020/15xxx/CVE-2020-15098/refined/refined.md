{
  "CVE-2020-15098": {
    "Description": "An internal verification mechanism in TYPO3 CMS can be used to generate arbitrary checksums, allowing the injection of arbitrary data with a valid HMAC-SHA1. This can lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution via insecure deserialization.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an internal verification mechanism that fails to properly scope the usage of cryptographic hashes, leading to ambiguous HMAC results. Specifically, the system uses HMAC-SHA1 without proper context, allowing an attacker to create valid checksums for arbitrary data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-325: Missing Required Cryptographic Step",
      "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation",
      "CWE-200: Information Exposure",
      "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
    ],
    "Impact": "The ability to generate arbitrary checksums allows attackers to inject malicious data with a valid cryptographic message authentication code. This can result in privilege escalation by exploiting database server access and remote code execution through insecure deserialization. It also results in sensitive information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network: The database server must be accessible to the attacker.",
        "An attacker needs access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action"
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A valid backend user session is required. The attacker must have access to the database server or access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation. Low privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability."
