# Authorization header is not sanitized in an error object

Low

[lzychowski](/lzychowski)
published
GHSA-5jpf-pj32-xx53
Jul 28, 2020

## Package

npm

auth0
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 2.27.0

## Patched versions

2.27.1

## Description

### Overview

Versions before and including `2.27.0` use a block list of specific keys that should be sanitized from the request object contained in the error object. When a request to Auth0 management API fails, the key for `Authorization` header is not sanitized and the `Authorization` header value can be logged exposing a bearer token.

### Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

* You are using `auth0` npm package
* You are using a Machine to Machine application authorized to use Auth0's management API <https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/client-credentials>

### How to fix that?

Upgrade to version `2.27.1`

### Will this update impact my users?

The fix provided in patch will not affect your users.

Node.js client library for the [Auth0](https://auth0.com) platform.

## Installation

```
npm install auth0
```

## Documentation

You can find this library documentation in this [page](https://auth0.github.io/node-auth0/).

For more information about [auth0](https://auth0.com) check our [documentation page](https://docs.auth0.com/).

## Authentication API Client

This client must be used to access Auth0's [Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication).

The **AuthenticationClient** constructor takes an *optional* client ID, if specified it will be used as default value for all endpoints that accept a client ID.

```
var AuthenticationClient = require('auth0').AuthenticationClient;

var auth0 = new AuthenticationClient({
  domain: '{YOUR_ACCOUNT}.auth0.com',
  clientId: '{OPTIONAL_CLIENT_ID}'
});
```

## Management API Client

The Auth0 Management API is meant to be used by back-end servers or trusted parties performing administrative tasks. Generally speaking, anything that can be done through the Auth0 dashboard (and more) can also be done through this API.

Initialize your client class with an API v2 token and a domain.

```
var ManagementClient = require('auth0').ManagementClient;

var management = new ManagementClient({
  token: '{YOUR_API_V2_TOKEN}',
  domain: '{YOUR_ACCOUNT}.auth0.com'
});
```
> Note: When using at browser you should use `telemetry: false`.

To obtain **automatically** a Management API token via the ManagementClient, you can specify the parameters `clientId`, `clientSecret` (use a Non Interactive Client) and optionally `scope`.
Behind the scenes the Client Credentials Grant is used to obtain the `access_token` and is by default cached for the duration of the returned `expires_in` value.

```
var ManagementClient = require('auth0').ManagementClient;
var auth0 = new ManagementClient({
  domain: '{YOUR_ACCOUNT}.auth0.com',
  clientId: '{YOUR_NON_INTERACTIVE_CLIENT_ID}',
  clientSecret: '{YOUR_NON_INTERACTIVE_CLIENT_SECRET}',
  scope: 'read:users update:users'
});
```
> Make sure your ClientId is allowed to request tokens from Management API in [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis)

To obtain a Management API token from your node backend, you can use Client Credentials Grant using your registered Auth0 Non Interactive Clients

```
var AuthenticationClient = require('auth0').AuthenticationClient;

var auth0 = new AuthenticationClient({
  domain: '{YOUR_ACCOUNT}.auth0.com',
  clientId: '{CLIENT_ID}',
  clientSecret: '{CLIENT_SECRET}'
});

auth0.clientCredentialsGrant(
  {
    audience: 'https://{YOUR_ACCOUNT}.auth0.com/api/v2/',
    scope: '{MANAGEMENT_API_SCOPES}'
  },
  function(err, response) {
    if (err) {
      // Handle error.
    }
    console.log(response.access_token);
  }
);
```

Also you can request a token when the user authenticates using any of our client side SDKs, e.g. [auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js).

## Promises and callbacks

Be aware that all methods can be used with promises or callbacks. However, when a callback is provided no promise will be returned.

```
// Using callbacks.
management.getUsers(function(err, users) {
  if (err) {
    // handle error.
  }
  console.log(users);
});

// Using promises.
management
  .getUsers()
  .then(function(users) {
    console.log(users);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    // Handle error.
  });
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 Account
