Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-15125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `auth0` npm package (specifically versions <= 2.27.0) handles error responses from the Auth0 Management API. The package uses a blocklist approach to sanitize sensitive data (like passwords and secrets) from the request object embedded within error objects. However, this blocklist did not include the "Authorization" header, which commonly contains bearer tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incomplete Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the incomplete sanitization of request data within error objects. The code failed to redact the `Authorization` header which exposes sensitive access tokens.
-   **Blocklist Approach:** Using a blocklist instead of an allowlist is inherently prone to omissions, as seen with the `Authorization` header. The reviewer even noted that it would miss keys such as `token`, `bearer`, `auth`, `key` and so on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Exposure of Bearer Tokens:** When a request to the Auth0 management API fails, the `Authorization` header, which often contains a bearer token, can be included in the error response. This could be inadvertently logged or exposed, leading to potential unauthorized access to the Auth0 Management API. This is significant because the Management API is used for performing administrative tasks and accessing sensitive information about users.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Error Logging:** The primary attack vector is through error logging or handling that would expose the error object, which includes the unsanitized `Authorization` header.
-   **Exposed Error Objects**: If error responses are not handled securely, the unsanitized header could be exposed through other channels like in a response to a client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Trigger Errors:** An attacker needs to be able to trigger errors in the application that makes calls to the Auth0 Management API to expose the `Authorization` header. 
-   **Access to Logs:** The attacker needs some access to the logs or the application's error handling to obtain the leaked bearer token.

**Additional Details:**

-   The fix was implemented in version `2.27.1` by expanding the blocklist to include the 'authorization' header.
-   The vulnerability is considered "Low" severity because it's an information disclosure vulnerability, and requires access to error logs or similar.
-   The reported identified the issue, suggesting that the issue was discovered via code review or penetration testing.
-   The issue was fixed by expanding the existing blacklist of keys to sanitize.
