Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2020-15392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue during the password recovery process of Supravizio BPM 10.1.2. The system provides different responses depending on whether the email address provided during password recovery is associated with a valid user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **User Enumeration:** The system's behavior allows an attacker to identify valid users by observing distinct responses when attempting password recovery. A message of "email not found" indicates an invalid user, while "contact the system administrator" suggests a valid user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can enumerate valid user accounts on the system.
*   **Brute Force Attacks:** Armed with a list of valid usernames (email addresses), attackers can conduct brute-force attacks or credential stuffing attempts against these valid accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Password Recovery Functionality:** The attack vector is the password reset/recovery feature. An attacker would attempt to reset a password using the target's email address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application's login page or password recovery page.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** No prior authentication is needed since the attack is performed via the password recovery functionality before logging in.
