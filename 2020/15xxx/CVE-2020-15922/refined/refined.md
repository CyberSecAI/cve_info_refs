Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-15922:

**Root Cause:**

*   OS Command Injection vulnerability in Mida Solutions eFramework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in OS commands, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. This allows the attacker to execute commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server with administrative (root) privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker can gain full control of the affected system.
*   **Internal Network Access:** If the vulnerable system is exposed on a network, an attacker might be able to pivot and access other internal systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The injection point is located on a PHP page, likely via GET or POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access (<=2.8.9):**  No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 2.8.9 and earlier.
*   **Authenticated Access (2.9.0):** In version 2.9.0, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the vulnerable endpoint. However, once authenticated, the attacker can execute commands as root.

**Versions Affected:**
* eFramework <= 2.9.0, specifically tested on 2.8.9 and 2.9.0

**Additional Details:**
* The content mentions that a complete Proof of Concept (POC) will be released in the future.
* The vendor was unresponsive to communications regarding the reported vulnerabilities.
