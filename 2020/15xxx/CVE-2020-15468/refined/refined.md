Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `cart_edit.php` script. Specifically, the `$_GET['active']` parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query without any filtering or escaping.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, retrieve sensitive information, modify data, or even take control of the entire database server.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable `cart_edit.php` page, injecting malicious SQL code into the `active` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special user privileges or system access is required beyond this.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is located within `cart_edit.php`:
```php
71: $active = $_GET['active'];
89: mysql_query $user_p = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query("SELECT * FROM `users` where id='$active'"));
```
The `$active` variable is directly assigned the value from the `active` GET parameter. This value is then directly included in a SQL query.
An example of a successful time-based blind SQL Injection payload, provided in the exploit is:
```
active=1' AND (SELECT 4169 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))wAin) AND 'zpth'='zpth
```
This payload causes a 5-second delay, demonstrating the vulnerability.
The exploit also provides SQLMap usage as:
```
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/cart_edit.php?active=1" -p active --cookie=[COOKIE] --technique=T --dbs
```
Which shows how an attacker can automate exploitation using SQLMap.
