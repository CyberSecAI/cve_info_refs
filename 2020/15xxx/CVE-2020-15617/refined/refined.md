**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_list_accounts.php` file of CentOS Web Panel. The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input for the `status` parameter before using it in the construction of SQL queries. This lack of input sanitization leads to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection vulnerability in `ajax_list_accounts.php`
*   Lack of input validation/sanitization on the `status` parameter
*   Insecure SQL query construction using unsanitized user-provided data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the database.
*   The attacker can gain unauthorized access to information in the context of the root user.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability over the network.
*   The attack vector is through the `status` parameter within the `ajax_list_accounts.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable CentOS Web Panel instance.
