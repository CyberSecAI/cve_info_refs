  "CVE-2020-15645": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `getFileFromURL` method in `GWTTestServiceImpl` lacks proper validation of a user-supplied URL before using it to download a file.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Unrestricted file upload via the `getFileFromURL` method due to a logical error in the URL validation, which allows downloads from arbitrary URLs instead of restricting them."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution as SYSTEM or root. An attacker can upload a malicious JSP file, which can then be executed to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM or root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the `getFileFromURL` method with a malicious JSP file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Marvell QConvergeConsole application and be able to send requests to the `getFileFromURL` method."
  }
