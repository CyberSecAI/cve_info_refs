#### Using SeedProd as a WordPress Website Builder

SeedProd is a WordPress Website Theme Builder, which allows you to create custom theme and template parts like: Headers, Footers, Front Pages, Content Pages, Blog Posts, Blog Pages, Archives, Search Results, Category Pages, Tag Pages, Sidebars, WooCommerce Product Pages. WooCommerce Checkout Pages, WooCommerce Cart Pages, WooCommerce Shop Pages all using our no-code Theme Builder.

Did I mention, no coding is required 🙂

#### Creating WordPress Landing Pages with SeedProd

What are landing pages? A landing page is a standalone web page that a person “lands” on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location. Most of the time, these landing pages have a different design from the rest of your site and do not show your website’s standard header and footer.

Landing Pages have a particular purpose and desired user action; therefore, you want them to be distraction-free as possible. With SeedProd, it is super easy to create high-converting landing pages for any purpose, that are entirely separate from your website’s design.

You can use our Domain Mapping feature to put landings page on their own domain, our Dynamic Text feature to add personalization, or our WooCommerce Blocks to build one-off product pages. These are just a few of the many powerful features SeedProd provides.

#### Building Coming Soon Pages and Maintenance Mode Pages with SeedProd

SeedProd allows you to build a coming soon or maintenance mode page that will hide your site from visitors and search engines like Google. You can work on your website in private. When the website uses coming soon mode, the page will be indexed by Google as long as your site is not set to be private in WordPress.

In Maintenance Mode, we return a 503 header status that lets Google know your site is down for maintenance.

Both of these modes are essential for any WordPress Website to have.

The Free Version of SeedProd comes with a variety of Coming Soon Page and Maintenance Mode templates.

## FAQ

### Can I build my entire WordPress website with this page builder?

With our WordPress Website Builder, you can now create your entire website and WordPress theme with SeedProd in the Pro version.

You can build landing pages, coming soon pages, maintenance mode pages in the free version. In addition, in the Pro version, you can create 404 pages and login pages.

### Will the SeedProd Page Builder work with my Theme

Coming soon pages, maintenance mode pages, and landing pages are standalone pages and are separate from your theme’s design. If you use the SeedProd WordPress Website Builder to build your website then a theme is not needed. SeedProd has its own theme built-in theme which can be customized. You can also use the Gutenberg, Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, Visual Composer, Thrive Architect, Brizy, or any other page builder on websites built with SeedProd. [More Info »](https://www.seedprod.com/features/seedprod-theme-builder-overview/)

### Does it work with WooCommerce?

\* Maintenance Mode Pages

\* Sales Pages

\* Opt-In Pages

\* Webinar Pages

\* Any type of landing page you can imagine.

### What’s the difference between Coming Soon Page Mode and Maintenance Mode?

Coming Soon Page Mode returns an http status 200 and allows your site to be indexed by Google and other search engines while under construction. You should always use Coming Soon Page mode when your site is under construction.

Maintenance Mode returns an http status code 503 and should be used when doing short-term maintenance on an existing site. This will let search engines know your site is undergoing maintenance and should return in 1 day when maintenance mode is finished.

### Who can see the website while it’s under construction?

Only logged in visitors can see the website while your website is under construction. Logged out visitors will see the under construction page or maintenance mode page depending on which mode you have selected.

### Disabled the Coming Soon Plugin and it still shows

This is always a WordPress caching issue. Go to the caching plugin’s settings page and clear the cache.

I went through several plugins to easily enable a coming soon or maintenance mode page. This one works for me. Easy to build out want I want using simple editing tools. I know there are a lot more things I can do with the plugin, so I have more exploring to do. But nailed it for what I needed.

J’utilise le mode Maintenance pour l’instant, et il est top ! Très simple d’utilisation, et fonctionne parfaitement.

# Stored XSS Vulnerability found in Coming Soon Page, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd Plugin

June 25, 20203 min read

![](https://www.jinsonvarghese.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-25-at-10.27.06-AM-1128x484.png)

Coming Soon Page, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd plugin for WordPress version 5.1.0 and below were found to be vulnerable to stored XSS while I was auditing the plugin.

Plugin version 5.1.2 with improved data sanitization was released on June 24, 2020.

**[CVE-2020-15038](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15038)**

## **Summary**

Coming Soon Page, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd is a popular WordPress Plugin with over 1 million active installations. It was found to be vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS is a type of vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to perform various malicious actions such as stealing the victim’s session cookies or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim’s behalf, logging their keystrokes and more.

## Impact

While there are multiple ways in which an attacker can perform malicious actions exploiting this vulnerability, let’s take a look at two.

If an attacker were to exploit the vulnerability, they would be able to use an XSS payload to cause redirection such that any time the developer enables maintenance mode, a user visiting the site would be redirected to a domain under the attacker’s control, which could be made to look exactly like the original website with a login form for the user to submit their credentials. If the user submits their credentials without noticing the changed domain, their account gets compromised.

Similarly, an attacker can also use a payload to create a login form on the Coming Soon/Maintenance Mode page itself, trying to bait unsuspecting users into entering their credentials.

## Vulnerability

The Headline field under the Page Settings section along with other fields in the plugin settings were found to be vulnerable to stored XSS, which gets triggered when the Coming Soon page is displayed (both in preview mode and live).

## **Timeline**

* Vulnerability reported to the SeedProd team – June 22, 2020.
* Version 5.1.2 containing the fix to the vulnerability released – June 24, 2020.

## **Recommendation**

It is highly recommended to update the plugin to the latest version.
