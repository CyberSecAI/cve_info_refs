Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `parse_report` function within `src/whoopsie.c` of the whoopsie package. Specifically, the function fails to properly validate the data length when parsing crash report files located in `/var/crash/`. This lack of validation allows an attacker to control the data length passed to memory allocation functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The vulnerability allows for the allocation of memory without proper bounds checking, leading to an excessive memory allocation.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The uncontrolled allocation can lead to a denial-of-service condition because the system will consume excessive memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition on the affected system. When a large amount of memory is requested, the whoopsie daemon can crash, cause the system to hang, or trigger the operating system's Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer, thereby disrupting the system's error reporting capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have the ability to write to `/var/crash/`.
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker crafts a malformed crash report file that is placed in `/var/crash/`. This report contains data which, when parsed, causes an out-of-bounds memory allocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine.
- **Write Permissions:** The attacker requires write access to the `/var/crash/` directory or the ability to cause a program to create a crash report with malicious content to that directory.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in whoopsie versions 0.2.69 and earlier.
* The vulnerable code calls `g_malloc` or `g_realloc` (functions used for memory allocation within glib/gmem.c) based on an attacker-controlled data length.
* A proof-of-concept exploit, `whoopsie_killer2.py`, has been developed and shared to demonstrate the vulnerability by creating a malformed crash file (`fake.crash`). This script fills the crash file with a size based on available system RAM to trigger the vulnerability. The `whoopsie_killer2.py` script monitors the system journal for whoopsie related messages to verify successful triggering of the vulnerability.

The vulnerability was addressed in Ubuntu security notice USN-4450-1.
