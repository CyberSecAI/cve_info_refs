  "cve": "CVE-2020-15644",
  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Marvell QConvergeConsole 5.5.0.64. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the setAppFileBytes method of the GWTTestServiceImpl class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-10550.",
  "information": {
    "root_cause": "Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations within the `setAppFileBytes` method of the `GWTTestServiceImpl` class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of SYSTEM.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via the `setAppFileBytes` method of the `GWTTestServiceImpl` class.",
      "Bypassing authentication mechanism"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to bypass the existing authentication mechanism",
      "Ability to send crafted requests to the `setAppFileBytes` method",
	  "Valid authenticated session"
    ],
    "technical_details": "The vulnerability is caused by an incomplete fix for a previously patched vulnerability. The fix only checks the 'name' parameter for path traversal but not the `prePath` parameter. An attacker can specify `prePath=\"QCCAgentInstallers\"`, `name=\"webshell.jsp\"`, `iType=4`, and `data=<contents_of_the_webshell_jsp_file>`, and `iMode=1`. This creates a malicious web shell in the context path of the QCCAgentInstallers web application, which doesn't require authentication. The attacker can then send commands to the JSP web shell, which is running with SYSTEM or root account privileges."
