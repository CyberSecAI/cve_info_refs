The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Zyxel CNM SecuManager, including CVE-2020-15332 which is related to "Hardcoded Secrets, APIs".

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2020-15332:

**Root Cause:**
- Hardcoded secrets and API keys within the `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` configuration file.
- The configuration file has world readable permissions, allowing any user to access the secrets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hardcoded API Keys:** The file contains hardcoded values for `APP_KEY` and `OAUTH_SECRET_KEY`, which are used for communication between the device and the MyZyxel cloud platform.
- **Hardcoded JWT Secrets:** The file contains hardcoded `SERVER_ACCESS_SECRET` and `SERVER_ACCESS_KEY_ID`. These secrets, combined with an `account_id` (that can be obtained through other vulnerabilities), are used to generate JWT tokens for secure communication with the cloud platform.
- **Insecure Permissions:** The configuration file has world-readable permissions (`-rw-r--r--`), making these secrets accessible to any local user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromise of Cloud Communication:**  An attacker can use the hardcoded keys and secrets to impersonate the device and gain unauthorized access to the cloud management platform.
- **Data Exposure:** Could lead to exposure of sensitive data transmitted to/from the cloud.
- **Manipulation of Cloud Services:**  The attacker could potentially manipulate settings of the device and/or associated accounts via the MyZyxel cloud.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the device can read the configuration file and extract the hardcoded secrets.
- **Remote Exploitation (Chained with Other Vulnerabilities):** In combination with other vulnerabilities, such as the unauthenticated ZODB access or backdoor APIs, these secrets could be extracted remotely, allowing an attacker to compromise devices without any prior knowledge of specific credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** Requires at least a local user account on the device to read the configuration file.
- **Remote User (with Chained Vulnerabilities):** An attacker could potentially extract the secrets remotely if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**
- The file `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` contains the following hardcoded parameters:
  ```
  APP_KEY="85ca73265e977fd46805163b8f7d66b0395b56f31b7e5850f2514f10d41a482b"
  OAUTH_SECRET_KEY="SvaK1LoGZMu8ZgZ6TKJGCwx+xiEBooSLmaQUiyAyUDTDbHFZtT3PCob9QL/pfzA3oGw0t0ANVO4KTbkrAwonP4lL+ax0ijqS9cAtTPGSMfw="
  SERVER_ACCESS_SECRET=""
  SERVER_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
  ```
- The permissions of `/opt/axess/etc/default/axess` are `-rw-r--r--`.
- The python file `/opt/axess/opt/axess/zyxel/zyxel_customizations/live.CloudCNMEntryPoint/config/config.py` is using the above parameters to establish secure connection with the cloud platform.
- The `jwt_secret` and `jwt_secret_id` are used by the function `get_account_info` inside the `myzyxel.pyc` python script which communicates with the cloud over HTTPS.

This information provides more detailed information than what's typically found in a standard CVE description, particularly around the exact location of the secrets and how they are used within the application.
