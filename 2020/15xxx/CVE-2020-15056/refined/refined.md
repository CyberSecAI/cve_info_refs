The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-15056.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The server name parameter within the web administration interface of the affected USB network servers is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unfiltered and unescaped embedding of user-supplied data (server name) into a JavaScript file.
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- This enables persistent access to the web interface.
- Attackers can potentially attack other systems in the local network through the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Manipulation of the server name parameter via the web administration interface.
- An attacker must have access to the network to interact with the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device
- The attacker can be unauthenticated if combined with the authentication bypass vulnerability
- Ability to send crafted requests to the web interface of the USB network server.
