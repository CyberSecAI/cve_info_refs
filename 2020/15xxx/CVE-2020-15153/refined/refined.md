Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated SQL injection flaw in the `get_info` function within the `database_object.abstract.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `object_id` parameter in the `get_info` function was not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. Specifically, the code uses string interpolation to build SQL queries instead of using parameterized queries/prepared statements

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:**  An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the Ampache database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The provided example demonstrates how an attacker could insert a new user with administrative privileges. An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, depending on the database user permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `ajax.server.php` endpoint.
*   **`artist_info` Action:** The specific example attack URL targets the `artist_info` action, injecting SQL code via the `artist` parameter. However, other actions using the vulnerable function could be targeted as well.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Ampache server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to identify which parameters can inject SQL code into vulnerable queries.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Ampache version 4.2.2 and commit `e92cb6154` on the develop branch.
*   The fix involved typecasting the `object_id` to an integer and using parameterized queries (prepared statements) using `?` placeholders for the parameters instead of string interpolation to construct the SQL queries.
*   A workaround was provided, which involves replacing the vulnerable `get_info` function with the patched version.
*   The advisory mentions that there are no specific CWEs associated with this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by `usox`.
*   The exploit example provided shows how to insert an administrative user, which can lead to a full compromise of the application.
