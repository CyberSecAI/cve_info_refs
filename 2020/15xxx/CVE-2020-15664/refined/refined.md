{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A malicious webpage could gain access to the InstallTrigger object through a reference to the `eval()` function of an about:blank window, allowing them to prompt the user to install an extension.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The InstallTrigger object could be initialized using the principal from the wrong inner window if not active, leading to permission inheritance from the target window."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick a user into installing a malicious extension by displaying a prompt that appears legitimate, potentially leading to further exploitation via manipulation of Extensions.jsm or storage APIs.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage loads an about:blank window, gains a reference to its eval function, loads a target webpage (e.g., extension installation page) in that window and then triggers the InstallTrigger."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to serve the malicious webpage."
