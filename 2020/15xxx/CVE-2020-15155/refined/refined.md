Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input within the baserCMS administration panel. Specifically, the `toolbar.php` component is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This could happen in the content management screen, system settings or theme file edit sections.
*   **Code Injection:**  A system administrator can upload and execute arbitrary PHP files, leading to potential full system compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*  **Code Execution:** The code injection vulnerability can lead to the attacker gaining complete control of the server and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker injects malicious code by entering crafted input in content management, system setting, or theme file edit sections which is then rendered in the admin panel via `toolbar.php`.
*   **Code Injection**: An administrator uploads a malicious PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to have an account with access to the administrative interface.
*   **Code Injection:** The attacker needs to have system administrator privileges.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects baserCMS versions 4.3.6 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in version 4.3.7.
*   Patches are available for earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was found by Aquilao Null and stypr.
*   The severity is rated as low.

**Summary of changes in the fix:**
The commit `94cbfab74c9fd6d04492597a1a684674c3c0e30f` modified `app/webroot/theme/admin-third/Elements/admin/toolbar.php` and `lib/Baser/View/Elements/admin/toolbar.php`.  These changes involve adding `h()` function which escapes html entities to prevent the XSS.
