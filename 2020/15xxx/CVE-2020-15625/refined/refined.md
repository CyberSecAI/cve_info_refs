Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when parsing the `username` parameter within the `ajax_add_mailbox.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** This specific SQL injection is used to achieve information disclosure

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can disclose sensitive information within the context of the root user. This could potentially expose user data, system configurations, or other sensitive details.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote, Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
    *   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerable `username` parameter is likely passed via an HTTP request to `ajax_add_mailbox.php`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, making it accessible to any attacker with network access to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running CentOS Web Panel.
