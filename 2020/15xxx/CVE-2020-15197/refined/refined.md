Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15197

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation within the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code does not check if the provided `splits` tensor results in a valid partitioning of the `values` tensor, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads. Additionally, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` operation fails to validate if the input `indices` tensor has rank 2 (is a matrix), leading to a crash if an incorrect rank is passed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap buffer overflow:** In `RaggedCountSparseOutput`, the missing validation on `splits` can cause a heap buffer overflow when the code attempts to read beyond the bounds of the `split_values` tensor.
*   **Crash due to assertion failure:** In `SparseCountSparseOutput`, an incorrect rank of input `indices` tensor leads to a `CHECK` assertion failure and a crash due to the code attempting to interpret it as a matrix.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Heap buffer overflow:** The heap buffer overflow in `RaggedCountSparseOutput` can lead to denial of service (DoS) or potentially other more severe impacts like arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** The crash in `SparseCountSparseOutput` caused by an invalid input tensor will also cause a denial of service, especially in serving installations where users have some control over input tensors.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed input:** An attacker can craft a malformed input tensor with a `splits` tensor that doesn't correctly partition the `values` tensor for `RaggedCountSparseOutput`, or provide a `indices` tensor with invalid rank to `SparseCountSparseOutput`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input tensors to the vulnerable `RaggedCountSparseOutput` and `SparseCountSparseOutput` operations. This could involve:
    *   Directly calling the vulnerable TensorFlow ops
    *   Providing data to a machine learning model using the vulnerable ops
    *   Exploiting an application using TensorFlow that passes untrusted data to the vulnerable ops

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions 2.3.0.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.3.1 by adding validation checks for the `splits` and `indices` tensors.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
*   The patch is available at [3cbb917](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02).
*   The `SparseCountSparseOutput` vulnerability is considered a variant of [GHSA-p5f8-gfw5-33w4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-p5f8-gfw5-33w4).
