GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Desigo Insight is the BACnet management station of the Desigo building automation and control system
that works with the automation stations Desigo PX, Desigo TRA (Total Room Automation) and BACnet
third-party.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15792

The web service does not properly apply input validation for some query parameters in a reserved
area.

This could allow an authenticated attacker to retrieve data via a content-based blind SQL injection
attack.

CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an
SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’)

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15793

The device does not properly set the X-Frame-Options HTTP Header which makes it vulnerable to
Clickjacking attacks.

This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve or modify data in the context of a legitimate
user by tricking that user to click on a website controlled by the attacker.
