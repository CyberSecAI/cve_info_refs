Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15881

**Description:**
The content refers to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the `munki_facts` module of MunkiReport.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize data received through the `munki_facts` module. This allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is then stored by the application and executed within the browser when an administrator views the `munki_facts` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw, where malicious JavaScript code is stored on the server and later executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's browser when visiting the `munki_facts` page.
- Potential for Account Compromise: If exploited, this vulnerability can allow an attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other actions with the privileges of the administrator's account.
- Data Manipulation and Theft: Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or the manipulation of data within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Data Injection: A malicious actor can send crafted data to the application via the `munki_facts` module.
- Client-Side Execution: The stored malicious data is then executed within the browser of an administrator when accessing the `munki_facts` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to submit data via `munki_facts` module: An attacker must have the capability to send data to the `munki_facts` module. This may require access to the network where the target MunkiReport server is located or to a compromised machine reporting to the server.
- Administrator interaction: The vulnerability requires that an authenticated administrator visit the `munki_facts` page in the MunkiReport interface for the malicious code to be executed.

**Mitigation:**
- Update MunkiReport: Upgrade to the latest version of MunkiReport, which includes a patch for this vulnerability.
- Update `munki_facts` Module: If a full update is not feasible, update the `munki_facts` module to version 1.5 or later.
- Disable `munki_facts` Module: As a last resort, the `munki_facts` module can be disabled by removing it from the `MODULES` setting in the server configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in MunkiReport versions 2.5.3 to 5.6.2.
- The report emphasizes the importance of updating to the latest version as the preferred mitigation method.
- The security issue was discovered and reported by the Datadog security team.
