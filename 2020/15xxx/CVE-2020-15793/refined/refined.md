- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device does not properly set the X-Frame-Options HTTP Header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The lack of proper X-Frame-Options HTTP Header implementation makes the application vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can potentially retrieve or modify data in the context of a legitimate user by tricking that user to click on a website controlled by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed over the network. An attacker tricks a user into clicking on a malicious website they control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious website and trick a legitimate user into visiting it while they are also logged into the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application.
