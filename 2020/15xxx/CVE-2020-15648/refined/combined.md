#### [#CVE-2020-12402: RSA Key Generation vulnerable to side-channel attack](#CVE-2020-12402)

Reporter
Sohaib ul Hassan, Iaroslav Gridin, Ignacio M. Delgado-Lozano, Cesar Pereida García, Jesús-Javier Chi-Domínguez, Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, and Billy Bob Brumley, Network and Information Security (NISEC) Group, Tampere University, Finland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes.
We would like to thank Sohaib ul Hassan for contributing a fix for this issue as well.
*Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might.

Reporter
Chuck Harmston, Robert Hardy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user.

Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Windows DLL "webauthn.dll" was missing from the Operating System, and a malicious one was placed in a folder in the user's %PATH%, Thunderbird may have loaded the DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*Note: This issue only affects the Windows operating system; other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Benjamin Bouvier, Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 77. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

It is a little hard to determine what is going on here, since it looks like the stack is not quite complete, but one possibility is that |pair| is a dangling pointer.

This might be a more complete stack from esr:

So I definitely see a problem with peer (ie, remote) candidates here:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/598e50d2c3cd81cd616654f16af811adceb08f9f/media/mtransport/third_party/nICEr/src/ice/ice_component.c#961-969>

If nr\_ice\_component\_insert\_pair fails here, the candidate pair stays in the check\_list: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/598e50d2c3cd81cd616654f16af811adceb08f9f/media/mtransport/third_party/nICEr/src/ice/ice_component.c#1712>

Then, nr\_ice\_component\_process\_incoming\_check will destroy the peer candidate here:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/598e50d2c3cd81cd616654f16af811adceb08f9f/media/mtransport/third_party/nICEr/src/ice/ice_component.c#979>

This could lead to a UAF here, which is the same place we see an esr crash in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1643437#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in [@ nr_ice_component_process_incoming_check]"): <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/598e50d2c3cd81cd616654f16af811adceb08f9f/media/mtransport/third_party/nICEr/src/ice/ice_component.c#795>

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Probably pretty difficult, since it does not look like a sec-bug fix.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Pretty easy.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Unlikely to cause regressions.

Looks like cover bug landed successfully. Please nominate it for Beta and ESR68 approval when you get a chance. It grafts cleanly to both as-landed.

I am not sure that this is fixed just yet; we'll have to wait and see whether [bug 1644477](/show_bug.cgi?id=1644477 "RESOLVED FIXED - Candidate pair insertion code has readability issues") solved the problem.

The patch landed in nightly and beta is affected.

:bwc, is this bug important enough to require an uplift?

If not please set `status_beta` to `wontfix`.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1644076#c0)• 5 years ago |
|  | |

Commonly, websites use a response header like `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or CSP's `frame-ancestors` directive to disallow being embedded across origins.

It seems that this restriction can be easily bypassed with embeds like `<object data=url>` or `<embed src=url>`.

STR:

1. Find a website that disallows framing (i.e., `X-Frame-Options` set to `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` or has a CSP directive that does the same). This example will use <https://accounts.google.com>
2. Embed on a different origin using embed or object elements. Example:

   `data:text/html,embed:<embed src="https://accounts.google.com"><hr>object:<object data="https://accounts.google.com">`
3. Observe how both frames are loading successfully.

Expected results: Frames should not load and show an error page.

~~Interestingly, the test doesn't work when hosted on the web (i.e.., with content principal). Maybe there's a problem with the nullprincipal that the data URL gets? I wonder what happens with iframe sandbox...~~

We've had a third-party report of this (see dupe). Is there any chance of fixing this in time for 78/79?

Yes we should definitely fix that.

@Matt: Initially XFO checks were performed within [Document::StartDocumentLoad](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/ba5511bfb76bd6dcd168e463fc51926c11fc4c60#l1.21). Within [Bug 1599131](/show_bug.cgi?id=1599131 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove carve outs for downloads within x-frame-options when fission enabled") we moved them to [DocumentLoadListener::OnStartRequest](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/ba5511bfb76bd6dcd168e463fc51926c11fc4c60#l14.21).

It seems that DocumentLoadListener::OnStartRequest does not get called for `<embed src="https://accounts.google.com">` or also `<object data="https://accounts.google.com">`.

I know we have been discussing where to add the XFO checks before, but given that, can you think of a better place to add the XFO checks?

<object>/<embed> don't go through DocumentChannel/DocumentLoadListener right now unfortunately.

This is being worked on right now in [bug 1646899](/show_bug.cgi?id=1646899 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use DocumentChannel to for object/embed loads - Pt 1"), though it might not be able to land before soft freeze tomorrow.

If we want something to uplift, then reverting the object-specific paths of [bug 1599131](/show_bug.cgi?id=1599131 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove carve outs for downloads within x-frame-options when fission enabled") might be the safest choice.

Bumping security rating. This isn't directly bad for Firefox's security, but **lots** of websites rely on us to implement XFO properly for their security.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: It's a sec moderate from a Mozilla's point of view, though this web application security mechanism to prevent clickjacking might be considered a sec-high for lots of web pages since XFO is the number one security mechanism against clickjacking.
* **User impact if declined**: Web pages (using logins or other forms) might be framed by malicious actors and tricked into revealing their credentials to the attacker.
* **Fix Landed on Version**:
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Before making XFO fission compliant we have been shipping this code for a very long time - we are basically reverting to that behavior.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: no
