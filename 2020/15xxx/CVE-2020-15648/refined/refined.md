Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15648:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass the `X-Frame-Options` header and Content Security Policy (CSP) `frame-ancestors` directive when using `<object>` or `<embed>` tags.
- The issue was introduced when XFO checks were moved from `Document::StartDocumentLoad` to `DocumentLoadListener::OnStartRequest`. The latter is not called for `<object>` and `<embed>` elements

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **X-Frame-Options bypass:** Websites that use `X-Frame-Options` to prevent framing can be framed by using `<object data=url>` or `<embed src=url>`.
- **CSP frame-ancestors bypass:** Similar to `X-Frame-Options`, the CSP `frame-ancestors` directive can also be bypassed using `<object>` or `<embed>` tags.
- The vulnerability was a regression, introduced by [bug 1599131](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599131).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Clickjacking:** An attacker could embed a vulnerable website in a frame on a malicious page, potentially tricking users into performing actions they didn't intend (e.g., login or other sensitive actions). This could lead to unauthorized access to accounts and sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can embed a target website using the vulnerable `<object>` or `<embed>` tags on a malicious website they control. The malicious website would have to be on a different origin from the targeted website for the security protections to be bypassed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and host web pages.
- The attacker needs to know a website that uses X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors.
- No special privileges or access to the target website is needed besides the ability to access it like a normal user.

The provided content also includes details about the fix and its verification, including:

*   The fix involves reverting the changes that caused the vulnerability and re-introducing XFO checks in `Document::StartDocumentLoad` specifically for `<object>` and `<embed>` tags.
*   The fix was applied to Firefox 78.0.2 and later versions and ESR78.
*   The fix was verified by QA and tested through automated tests

The bug report also notes that while this is a moderate security issue for Mozilla products, it is potentially a high security risk for the affected websites, since XFO and CSP frame-ancestors are often used to prevent clickjacking.
