The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15015.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization or validation of SVG files uploaded to GleamTech FileUltimate. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the SVG file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. The application fails to neutralize or encode user-supplied data (in this case, the SVG file content), allowing malicious scripts to be executed within the context of the application's web page.
- Insecure SVG handling: The application does not properly sanitize or restrict the content of uploaded SVG files, particularly the inclusion of `<script>` tags.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the web application, which could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing of sensitive user data
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a crafted SVG file to GleamTech FileUltimate containing embedded JavaScript within a `<script>` tag.
- Opening the uploaded SVG file via the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload files to the vulnerable GleamTech FileUltimate application. This typically implies the attacker must be an authenticated user or the application needs to have an upload endpoint accessible by unauthenticated users.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the rendering of the uploaded malicious SVG file within the application, for example by viewing the uploaded file.
