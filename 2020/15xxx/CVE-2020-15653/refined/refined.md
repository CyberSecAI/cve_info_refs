Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15653:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly propagate iframe sandbox flags to new browsing contexts created via `rel=noopener/noreferrer` links when the `allow-popups` sandbox attribute is present. This occurs specifically when a new process is created for the popup. The browser was not passing the sandbox flags when opening a new window in a different process, thus the new popup window would not be sandboxed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient sandbox propagation:**  The primary weakness lies in the `nsWindowWatcher::OpenWindowInternal` logic, which fails to pass sandbox flags when creating a new window in a separate process via `noopener`.
*   **Process Switching Issue:** When "dom.noopener.newprocess.enabled" is true, a new process is used, and sandbox flags are not transferred to the new docshell.
*   **Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) amplification:**  COOP can amplify the issue, as sandboxed popups can escape their sandbox using a COOP response header even without `noopener`/`noreferrer`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox escape:** An attacker can bypass the iframe sandbox, potentially executing arbitrary JavaScript or other actions they are supposed to be prevented from doing within the sandbox.
*   **Data leakage:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information if the iframe is used to load data that is meant to be protected by the sandbox.
*  **Bypass of Same-Origin Policy (SOP):** In conjunction with COOP, the vulnerability allows a popup to be created with different security contexts, enabling cross-origin data access

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious website loads a sandboxed iframe with the `allow-popups` attribute.
*   The sandboxed iframe contains a link with `rel=noopener` or `rel=noreferrer`.
*   When a user clicks this link, a new popup is created without the necessary sandbox restrictions, leading to a sandbox escape.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to serve a web page that uses sandboxed iframes with `allow-popups`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the content loaded in the sandboxed iframe, such that it contains the malicious link.
*   User interaction is required to click on the malicious link within the iframe.
