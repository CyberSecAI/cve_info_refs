Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the 'username' parameter in the login URL of Quali CloudShell.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `username` parameter of the login URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they visit a specially crafted URL.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other unauthorized activities within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code in the `username` parameter.
- The victim is then lured to visit the malicious link via social engineering or other attack vectors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it.
- The attacker does not need to have any pre-existing access to the Quali CloudShell instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by adding the `username` parameter to the login URL, including a JavaScript payload.
- The specific payload used for exploitation is `{{constructor.constructor('alert(1337)')()}}`
- A less dangerous payload `"<sCript>alert(1337)<scRipt>"` also works, but it won't autoload through the URL.
- The exploitation occurs when the application renders the URL and executes the JavaScript code.
