The provided content details a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the iBall router WRB303N.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The iBall router WRB303N's web interface lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests that are executed by an authenticated user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The router's management interface does not implement adequate protection against CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can modify various router settings, including:
    *   IP subnets
    *   DHCP status (enable/disable)
    *   Remote management settings
    *   Web interface ports
    *   Other network layer components
*   An attacker can change administrator passwords.
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary administrative actions on the router without the user's consent.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (e.g. `iballcsrf.html`). This page contains a form that, when submitted, sends a request to the vulnerable router. This form is designed to change the router’s settings.
*   The attacker tricks an authenticated user (administrator) into visiting the malicious HTML page. This can be done by embedding the HTML in an iframe on another website or sending the user a link.
*   When the user loads the malicious page, the form automatically submits a request to the router's management interface on the user's behalf. If the user is already logged into the router's management interface, the request will be executed with the user's privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to create and host a malicious HTML page.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator of the iBall router into visiting the malicious page.
*   The attacker needs to know the IP address of the router’s web interface (default is usually 192.168.1.1) and the path to the vulnerable form handler `/goform/setSysTools`.
*   The attacker needs to know the specific form parameters and values to send to modify the router settings they want to control.

The provided `iballcsrf.html` file demonstrates a proof of concept for exploiting this vulnerability. It sets hidden form inputs to modify router parameters related to loginAuth, wanAdvCfg, lanCfg, remoteWeb, sysTime, and softWare. For instance, it modifies the LAN IP, subnet mask, DHCP settings, remote web access, and system time zone.
