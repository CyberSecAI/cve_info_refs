Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15246:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient path validation within the `FileDatasource` component of October CMS. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass intended restrictions on file access.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, which arises because the system does not properly sanitize or validate file paths provided in requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this flaw to read arbitrary local files on the server hosting the October CMS application. This could expose sensitive information, configuration files, or source code, depending on the system setup.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted request to the October CMS application. This suggests that the vulnerability is exposed through a web-accessible endpoint.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending malicious HTTP requests to the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The patch for this vulnerability includes improvements to path validation in `FileDatasource` and reorganization/cleanup of `Halcyon Builder`.
*   The commit `80aab47f044a2660aa352450f55137598f362aa4` on the `octobercms/library` repository is the core of the fix. This commit also includes a temporary disabling of SVG uploads and XSS filtering in system exception messages, but these are not directly related to the LFI.
*   Specifically, the `Halcyon\Builder.php` file was modified to include stricter path validation logic. The comments in the provided content show that the fix caused issues with how templates were being loaded with absolute paths, and this was addressed in a later commit.

**Affected Versions:**

*   October CMS versions between 1.0.421 and 1.0.468 (inclusive) are affected.
*   Version 1.0.469 and later are patched.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to October CMS version 1.0.469 or later.
*   Apply the patch manually by applying the changes from `octobercms/library@80aab47` if upgrading is not feasible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
*   The vulnerability was reported by `ka1n4t`.
*   The `SystemException.php` file was also modified to escape messages to prevent XSS. This is a related, but separate, security improvement.
*   There is a discussion around the use of absolute paths for templates. It highlights that the intended way to use templates should be within the theme path, or via Laravel's engine for reusable views
