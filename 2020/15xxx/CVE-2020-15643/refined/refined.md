  "cve": "CVE-2020-15643",
  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Marvell QConvergeConsole. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the saveAsText method of the GWTTestServiceImpl class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path in the `saveAsText` method of the `GWTTestServiceImpl` class before using it in file operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Authentication bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution as SYSTEM.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access",
      "Exploitation of saveAsText method",
      "Bypass authentication",
      "File upload"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "Authenticated attacker with network access can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the prePath parameter of the `saveAsText` method to write a malicious file to an accessible directory. The attacker has the ability to bypass authentication.",
    "more_details": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that while the 'name' parameter was checked for path traversal, the 'prePath' parameter was not. By specifying `prePath=\"QCCAgentInstallers\"` and `name=\"webshell.jsp\"`, an attacker can create a malicious web shell in the context path of the `QCCAgentInstallers` web application, which does not require authentication."
