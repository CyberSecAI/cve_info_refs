Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper access control within the Pega framework. Specifically, the application fails to restrict access to certain endpoints that should be exclusive to administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Vertical Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows a user with lower privileges to access functionalities or data that should only be accessible to users with higher privileges (administrators).
*   **Improper Access Control:** The application lacks the necessary checks to ensure that only authorized users can access the vulnerable endpoint (`GetWebInfo`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The `GetWebInfo` endpoint, when accessed without proper authorization, can disclose sensitive information. The nature of the information disclosed is not explicitly stated in the article, but it implies that the information would typically be restricted to administrators.
*   The content refers to "few endpoints which should ideally only accessible to the Admin of the system", meaning that besides `GetWebInfo` other endpoints could be vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable endpoint by manipulating the URL. The article provides example URLs demonstrating how to access the `GetWebInfo` activity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User Access:** An attacker needs to have at least basic user access to the application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint name (`GetWebInfo`) and how to craft a URL to access it.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Pega framework versions 8.4x and later.
*   **Hardening Instructions:** The article mentions that hardening instructions could mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable endpoint is `GetWebInfo`.
*   The vulnerability allows for a vertical privilege escalation.
