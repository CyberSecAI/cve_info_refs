Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15569:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error located in the `PlayerGeneric` destructor of the MilkyTracker software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The code attempts to use a pointer (`player`) after it has been freed. This occurs because the `mixer` object could potentially remove the `player` object which leads to the `player` object getting deleted, and then later the destructor attempts to delete `player` again.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to memory corruption. This can lead to denial of service. The Debian security advisory does not mention any other potential impact, however, use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user closes a MilkyTracker project/file that uses a player, specifically where a `PlayerGeneric` object is destroyed, triggering the destructor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to open a specially crafted project file or somehow trigger the deconstruction of the `PlayerGeneric` object with the vulnerable state. This could be achieved through local access or by providing a malicious file to a user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Github commit diff shows a fix which involves adding an extra check for the existence of `mixer` before accessing its methods and checking if the player was already removed, preventing the double free
- The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this vulnerability was addressed in version 0.90.86+dfsg-2+deb9u1.
