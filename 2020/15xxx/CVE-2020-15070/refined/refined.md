- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A privilege escalation vulnerability exists due to the use of `eval` on custom profile field values stored in the Postgres database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsanitized custom profile field values stored in the database are later processed using `eval`, leading to code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A privileged attacker with write access to the Zulip Postgres database can achieve code execution on the Zulip server.
- **Attack vectors**: By writing malicious custom profile field values directly to the Zulip Postgres database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to write directly to the Zulip Postgres database. The blog post clarifies that this is not a standard user role within Zulip.
