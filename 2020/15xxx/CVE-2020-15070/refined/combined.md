# Zulip Server 2.1.7 security release

  [![](/_astro/tabbott.Y0j5haym_Z1qaMxj.webp)](author/tabbott/)  [Tim Abbott](author/tabbott/)   Jun 26, 2020 • 2 min read

We released Zulip Server 2.1.7 today. This is a security release, containing a
couple cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 2.1.6.

## What’s new

This releases fixes multiple important bugs in previous versions of Zulip. It
contains fixes for the following issues:

* CVE-2020-15070: Fix privilege escalation vulnerability with custom profile
  fields. A privileged attacker who can write directly to the Zulip postgres
  database (which isn’t available to any user role in Zulip) could trigger code
  execution the Zulip server by storing an invalid custom profile field value
  that was later processed using `eval`.
* Changed default memcached authentication username to zulip@localhost. This
  fixes an issue where a Zulip server that was rebooted with a different
  hostname would be unable to authenticate to its memcached process due to the
  hostname being encoded in the generated memcached SASL credentials.

CVE-2020-15070 was discovered by the Zulip core team.

## Upgrading

All installations using LDAP synchronization should upgrade promptly to secure
their installations. See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release)
in the Zulip documentation.
