Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GVCP dissector in Wireshark could enter an infinite loop due to a flaw in how it handles certain packets. Specifically, the dissector did not ensure that an offset always increased, leading to the infinite loop condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Infinite loop vulnerability in the GVCP dissector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a malformed packet onto the network or convincing a user to open a malicious capture file, an attacker could cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire while Wireshark is capturing traffic.
- **Malicious Capture File:** Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Ability to inject packets into a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Social Engineering:** Ability to convince a user to open a malicious capture file.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.4

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark version 3.2.5 and later

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `epan/dissectors/packet-gvcp.c` file and fixed by making sure offset increases in all situations.
- The severity is rated as "moderate" by SUSE and "normal" by Gentoo
-  CVSS v3 scores vary, with NVD giving a base score of 7.5 (High) while SUSE gives 3.3 or 4.3 (Low/Moderate).
