Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `Person.query.get()` and `Person.query.get_by_name()` methods within the `ihatemoney` application's models. These methods were incorrectly performing database joins on the `Project` table without properly filtering the results based on the project associated with the `Person` record.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** The core issue is an authorization bypass that allows an authenticated user in one project to modify or delete members of another project. This bypass occurs because the database queries do not properly constrain results to the correct project.
- **Insecure Database Queries:**  Specifically, the queries were joining on the `Project` table without filtering based on `Person.project_id`, allowing the retrieval of `Person` records associated with any project as long as a project with the specified name existed.
- **Incorrect Data Association:** Modifying a member using the vulnerability can associate the member with the attacker's project, breaking the intended data association within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can alter the state (name, weight, activation status) of members in other projects they do not belong to.
- **Data Corruption:** Modifying member data can lead to incorrect data associations, making it appear that a member belongs to the attacker's project instead of their original project.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to, edit, and delete bills associated with members from other projects, due to incorrect data association after a successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
- **Data Integrity Loss:** The unauthorized modification and deletion of members, combined with access to their bills, leads to a significant loss of data integrity within the application.
- **Potential for Unauthenticated Attack:** While exploitation requires authentication, the ease of creating a new project and gaining authentication means the exposure is similar to an unauthenticated attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Exploitation:**
  -  `PUT` requests to `/api/projects/<project>/members/<personID>` can modify member information from other projects.
  -  `DELETE` requests to `/api/projects/<project>/members/<personID>` can deactivate members of other projects.
- **Web Interface Exploitation:** Editing members through the web interface at `/<project>/members/<personID>/edit` can lead to unauthorized data modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to any project within the application.
- **Knowledge of Project Name and Private Code:** The attacker needs valid project credentials (project name and its associated "private code") to exploit the vulnerability via the API or web interface.
- **No Prior Knowledge of Target Project:** The attacker does not need to know the name or private code of the target project from which they are stealing/modifying member information.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability in `Person.query.get_by_name()` that could lead to a `MultipleResultsFound` exception was not exploitable in the current version, as this function is not used anywhere in the application.
- The fix involves correctly filtering database queries by using `Person.project_id` to ensure that the operation is performed on members of the correct project.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "High" in one source and "Moderate" in another source but the CVSS v4 metrics in the "Moderate" rated source indicates the impact of this vulnerability is high.
