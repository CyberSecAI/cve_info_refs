Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of cursor parameters (`before`, `after`) passed to the `paginate()` function in the `paginator` library. The library was using `:erlang.binary_to_term` to decode the parameters, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious data is provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious payload in the cursor parameters.
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The use of `:erlang.binary_to_term` without proper input validation is an unsafe deserialization practice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could gain complete control over the server/application running the vulnerable `paginator` library by executing arbitrary code. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and other severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `before` and `after` cursor parameters in the `paginate()` function of the `paginator` library. These parameters are used for pagination and are received as input (likely via web requests) by the application using the library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the cursor parameters (e.g., by modifying query parameters in HTTP requests).
- No special privileges within the application are needed, as the vulnerability exists in how user-provided input is processed in the library.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of `paginator` prior to 1.0.0.
- The fix involves replacing `:erlang.binary_to_term` with `Plug.Crypto.non_executable_binary_to_term` which prevents the execution of arbitrary code from the deserialized data.
- The fix also includes adding an `ArgumentError` if an executable term is detected in the cursor parameters.
- The patched version requires Elixir version >= 1.5 due to a dependency.
- The advisory mentions that users should immediately upgrade to version 1.0.0 or later.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Peter St√∂ckli.
