Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in `img_auth.php`, where `FileBackend::streamFile()` was called with the headers as a second parameter instead of being part of the `$params` array as `headers` key. This caused the `Cache-Control: private` and `Vary: Cookie` response headers to be omitted when serving images from paths configured in `$wgImgAuthUrlPathMap`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core issue is the improper passing of parameters to `FileBackend::streamFile()`. Specifically, it was called like this:
```php
$be->streamFile(['src' => $filename], ['Cache-Control: private', 'Vary: Cookie']);
```
Instead of like this:
```php
$be->streamFile([
    'src' => $filename,
    'headers' => ['Cache-Control: private', 'Vary: Cookie']
]);
```
This resulted in private images served by extensions from these configured paths being cached publicly by a caching server, like ATS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact is that private images, which should only be accessible to authorized users, may become publicly available due to caching. Unauthorized users could access these cached files by requesting the same URL. In the WMF environment, the affected content was primarily EasyTimeline images.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  An authorized user requests an image served through a path configured in `$wgImgAuthUrlPathMap`.
2.  Due to the incorrect parameter passing, the `Cache-Control: private` and `Vary: Cookie` headers are missing in the response.
3.  The caching server (like ATS) caches the response, including the image.
4.  An unauthorized user requests the same image URL from the caching server, which now serves the cached (public) version of the image without requiring proper authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the URL of the private image.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to access the caching server.
*   The vulnerable MediaWiki instance needs to be behind a caching server.
*   The MediaWiki instance has to be configured with `$wgImgAuthUrlPathMap` for the image path being accessed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is considered a minor security issue by the MediaWiki team, as it only affects a specific configuration.
*   The fix is a simple correction of the way headers were passed to the stream file function, without complex logic changes.
*   The fix was applied to MediaWiki versions 1.31.8, 1.33.4, and 1.34.2.
*   This was assigned CVE-2020-15005.
