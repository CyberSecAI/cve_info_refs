## Description

![@joohoi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5235109?v=4&size=48)[joohoi](https://github.com/joohoi)opened [on Jul 1, 2020](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl/issues/461#issue-649140488)

Hi, I stumbled upon a reflected XSS in the software.

It stems from reflecting unsanitized user controller input directly to the HTTP response.

I initially observed this in Tileserver GL 2.5, but from the looks of it it's still present in the current `master`.

Vulnerable request example:

```
https://example.org/?key=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E

```

The code in question is here <https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl/blob/master/src/server.js#L322-L323>
