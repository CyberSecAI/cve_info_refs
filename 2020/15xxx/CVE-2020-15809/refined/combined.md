## Introduction

![DSOS](/w/images/7/73/DSOS_icon.png "DSOS")

DSOS™ by [SpinetiX™](https://www.spinetix.com/) is a lightweight, secured operating system designed for digital signage [players](/wiki/Players "Players"), especially for demands of defense, financial, cruise vessel and other high-availability scenarios. Native to the [SpinetiX players](/wiki/SpinetiX_players "SpinetiX players"), DSOS also brings embedded system design to the entire Intel ecosystem, ideal for fanless architectures like Intel Goldmont, but scalable to i5, i7 or i9 when maximum performance matters.

*See all the [supported players running DSOS](/wiki/DSOS#Supported_hardware_platforms "DSOS").*

## Release 4.8.6

Release name: "[Stecknadelhorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stecknadelhorn "wikipedia:Stecknadelhorn")" 4.8.6. Release date: November 18th, 2024.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400")/[W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410")/[W](/wiki/IBX410W "IBX410W"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party DSOS players](/wiki/Third-party_DSOS_players "Third-party DSOS players").
Firmware version number: 4.8.6-1.0.0-314c32d5
### New

* Added support for having an independent overlay content which shows on top of the regular content. This enables scenarios such as independently managed dynamic alert projects which show only when specific events occur; the URI of this overlay content is added in the player configuration. *This feature requires a [DSOS KIOSK](/wiki/DSOS_KIOSK "DSOS KIOSK") or [SYSTEMS](/wiki/SYSTEMS "SYSTEMS") license.*
* Added support for Bluefin Ocean platform with Intel N97 CPUs embedded in Flex-OS displays from Bluefin.

### Improvements

* The hardware watchdog is now used to trigger reboots when the software watchdog detects a malfunction; previously a normal software driven reboot was used which is less robust and could eventually result in hanging the player during the reboot, requiring a power cycle to recover depending on the type of malfunction.
* Added support for extracting all media types from SharePoint news posts and pages, including images, videos, titles, descriptions, and links to full articles.

*Applies to all [DSOS players](/wiki/DSOS_players "DSOS players"), except [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA")*

* More information about the graphics rendering device are now included in the [player report](/wiki/Player_report "Player report"), for better diagnostics.

### Fixes

* Changes to the [display power save](/wiki/Display_power_save "Display power save") configuration that should have resulted in changing the screen power state were not always correctly applied until the next power state change, or a reboot.
* Player enrollment in the SpinetiX cloud failed and rebooted the player if an [HTTP proxy](/wiki/HTTP_proxy "HTTP proxy") was configured, it required credentials and the configured credentials were invalid; the repeated crashes resulted in the player entering [Recovery mode](/wiki/Recovery_mode "Recovery mode").
* The [player content server](/wiki/Player_content_server "Player content server") was enabled even when the [DSOS license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license") did not allow it. *This was a regression introduced with 4.7.5.*
* Having a standalone [DSOS license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license") on a player connected to an [SpinetiX ARYA Enterprise](/wiki/SpinetiX_ARYA_Enterprise "SpinetiX ARYA Enterprise") account with a bundled license of a different type made the [embedded web server](/wiki/Embedded_web_server "Embedded web server") return invalid headers in responses.
* Raised the limit on the number of slices permitted in H.264 videos from 16 to 32, as some [streaming](/wiki/Streaming "Streaming") [encoders](/wiki/Encoders "Encoders") may use more than 16 slices.
* H.264 videos with negative Picture Order Count (POC) values, which occur when using open-GOP with Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (IDR) frames, were not decoded correctly, leading to choppy playback.
* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") inadvertently logged trace level messages to a temporary file.
* Limit excessive connected / disconnected log messages that occur on Bluefin N97 based displays when enabling [display power saving](/wiki/Display_power_saving "Display power saving").

*Applies to all [DSOS players](/wiki/DSOS_players "DSOS players"), except [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA")*

* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") and many of the [player APIs](/wiki/Player_APIs "Player APIs") endpoints exposed by the [embedded web server](/wiki/Embedded_web_server "Embedded web server") had slow response times (~600 ms) due to the [DSOS license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license") checking; the license checking mechanism was reworked to avoid this overhead and now response times are in the 30 to 40 ms range.

*Applies to [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410")/[W](/wiki/IBX410W "IBX410W") and [third-party DSOS players](/wiki/Third-party_DSOS_players "Third-party DSOS players") based on [Elkhart Lake](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/platforms/details/elkhart-lake.html) and [Jasper Lake](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/codename/128823/products-formerly-jasper-lake.html) CPU platforms*

* Enabled the hardware watchdog to ensure the player automatically reboots in case of a complete system freeze, complementing the software watchdog that handles reboots in most cases.

### Developer

[Web Storage REST API](/wiki/Web_Storage_REST_API "Web Storage REST API")

* Some [CORS response headers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing#Response_headers "wikipedia:Cross-origin resource sharing") returned by the [embedded web server](/wiki/Embedded_web_server "Embedded web server") were incorrect, response headers which are only for preflight requests were returned for all requests.
* The PURGE method was not CORS enabled.
* The proper Content-Type and Cache-Control headers were not always returned, and browsers could cache the responses depending on modification dates.

## Release 4.8.5

Release name: "[Stecknadelhorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stecknadelhorn "wikipedia:Stecknadelhorn")" 4.8.5. Release date: August 12th, 2024.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400")/[W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410")/[W](/wiki/IBX410W "IBX410W"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.8.5-1.0.0-2c483a1f
### Improvements

* Improved the pairing PIN display in [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center"), used to add a player to [ARYA](/wiki/ARYA "ARYA"). The PIN is now hidden by default and show button is available, this makes sure the displayed PIN is always current.
* [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") is updated to version 2.20.0.
* Improved the clock skew compensation mechanism added in DSOS 4.8.4 to reduce the number of requests needing to be retried.

### Fixes

* Failed requests or requests requiring authentication were mistakenly considered as successful, making [Pull Mode](/wiki/Pull_Mode "Pull Mode") operations fail when an [HTTP proxy](/wiki/HTTP_proxy "HTTP proxy") was used.

### Security

Updated base libraries and components, the main changes are as follows:

* Apache httpd: update from version 2.4.61 to 2.4.62, which fixes CVE-2024-40725, which affected DSOS, and CVE-2024-40898, which did not affect DSOS.

## Release 4.8.4

Release name: "[Stecknadelhorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stecknadelhorn "wikipedia:Stecknadelhorn")" 4.8.4. Release date: July 24th, 2024.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400")/[W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410")/[W](/wiki/IBX410W "IBX410W"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.8.4-1.0.0-e62e6443
### New

* Added support for retrieving SharePoint news posts, including title, description, header image, and link to full article. *This social network channel is available within the advanced [data feed widgets](/wiki/Data_feed_widgets "Data feed widgets") of [Elementi X](/wiki/Elementi_X "Elementi X").*

### Improvements

* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center")
  + Added the pairing PIN on the main page to ease adding a player to [ARYA](/wiki/ARYA "ARYA").
  + The display info box no longer shows the "type" item, as the information was misleading and not useful with current platforms.
* [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") is updated to version 2.19.0.
* The Apache httpd version is no longer returned within the HTTP response headers to avoid misdetection of security vulnerabilities, since often vulnerabilities are fixed by backports without increasing the version number.
* Added capability to select audio track by number, using "#n" syntax in the [`spx:audio` attribute](/wiki/SVG#spx:audio "SVG").
* Added new [`spx:rangeRequests` attribute](/wiki/SVG#spx:rangeRequests "SVG") to media layers for disabling the use of HTTP byte range requests for compatibility with servers that do not support it properly.
* Added automatic [clock skew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_skew "wikipedia:Clock skew") compensation so that players or computers whose local clock is off by more than 5 minutes can still communicate with the SpinetiX cloud; the compensation is however limited, as very large offsets anyhow break TLS certificate validation.
* Updated EULA to the December 5, 2023, version.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W")*

* The [Status API](/wiki/Status_API "Status API") now includes information about the present power sources (usb, poe, or poe+usb).

 *Applies to [third-party DSOS players](/wiki/Third-party_DSOS_players "Third-party DSOS players")*

* Added support for the [iQnetiX EMP-III](/wiki/IQnetiX_EMP-III "IQnetiX EMP-III") player.
* Added support for the Intel AX101 Wi-Fi module.

### Fixes

* [SRT streams](/wiki/Streaming#SRT "Streaming") with multiple audio tracks failed to be decoded.
* Elementi and the player on DSOS did not use the same user HTTP user agent string, now they both use "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) SpinetiX-resac/1.1".

*Applies to [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440") and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players") using Gen12 Intel GPUs*

* The [video output streaming](/wiki/Video_output_streaming "Video output streaming") feature did not work

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410"), [iBX410W](/wiki/IBX410W "IBX410W"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* The video timings for the 4096x2160@60p-256:135 video mode were incorrect, using 2106 lines instead of 2160 lines, due to a typo.

*Applies to [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA")*

* The "ENERGY\_PERF\_BIAS set to normal (6)" message was being logged at boot, even if the platform had no ENERGY\_PERF\_BIAS setting.

### Security

Updated base libraries and components, the main changes are as follows:

* curl: fix CVE-2024-2398, which did not affect [DSOS](/wiki/DSOS "DSOS").
* httpd: update from version 2.4.58 to 2.4.61, which fixes CVE-2024-24795, CVE-2024-38473, CVE-2024-38474, CVE-2024-38475, CVE-2024-38476, CVE-2024-38477, CVE-2023-38709, CVE-2024-39573 and CVE-2024-39884 which may affect DSOS and CVE-2024-27316, CVE-2024-38472 and CVE-2024-36387, none of which affect DSOS.

Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410"), [iBX410W](/wiki/IBX410W "IBX410W"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.8.3-1.0.0-45ef4dae
### Improvements

* Display power schedule changes no longer require a reboot to be applied.
* Recovery console is updated to version 2.18.2.
* It is now possible to configure [web page layers](/wiki/Elementi_layers#Web_page_layer "Elementi layers") to run in secure context, as if they were loaded via HTTPS; this is controlled by the new `spx:secureContext` attribute, which defaults to false for backwards compatibility. Running in a secure context allows access to some restricted HTML APIs, like audio and video capture, but disables loading of content from HTTP sources

*Applies to [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440") only.*

* [Multi-output](/wiki/Multi-output "Multi-output") configurations now support individual rotation of each display, using per output attributes; no particular  [license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license") is required, but the resulting display layout should be compatible with the installed [DSOS license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license").

### Fixes

* The buffer size used for [streaming](/wiki/Streaming "Streaming") was too small for high resolutions streams with bursty bitrates, and could cause lost video frames from streaming sources.
* Configuring [SNMP](/wiki/SNMP "SNMP") as "open to everybody" after having configured it to be open for only some IP addresses resulted in [SNMP](/wiki/SNMP "SNMP") still being partially restricted to those IP addresses.
* The power\_state indicator in the display-info did not always reflect the true value of the display power state set by the player.
* The [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") wizard did not clear the previous display configuration before applying the new one, which could result in mixed display configurations.
* When disabling a display power schedule not all the related services were disabled, the serial port part remained active.

*Applies to [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440") only.*

* Images downloaded from remote servers were downscaled to 4K resolution although decoding 8K images is supported, they are now downscaled to 8K on these players.

*Applies to [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410") and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players") using Elkhart Lake Intel CPUs*

* The [video output streaming](/wiki/Streaming#Video_output_streaming "Streaming") feature did not work on these players.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* The unused grub components removed from [DSOS](/wiki/DSOS "DSOS") in 4.8.2 were not removed during firmware updates, only on newly installed [DSOS](/wiki/DSOS "DSOS").
* Spurious error messages related to the "wlan-cfg" network interface from various network daemons appeared when resetting a device to factory default settings.

*Applies to [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA")*

* A spurious "failed to run licensecheck" error message appeared in the system log, but these player models do not need any license check.

### Fixes

* The release name, "Stecknadelhorn", was not properly set.
* The software watchdog rebooted the system via the hardware watchdog instead of the kernel, which made diagnostics confusing. *This was a regression introduced in 4.5.0.*
* An innocuous "no such table: WEBSTORAGE" error message, without consequence, could appear during boot.
* Fixed PHP warning about undefined offset.
* Animated GIFs would play at a maximum of 10 fps, any higher fps animated GIF was playing in slow motion.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* 4K was proposed as the default resolution in the [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") wizard, instead of 1080p as in 4.7.7 and earlier versions; this was an unintended change in 4.8.0.
* In some cases, players could crash and reboot due to contention on the GPU memory. *This was a regression introduced in 4.8.0.*
* Sometimes the temperature from the internal sensor could be reported as "not found".
* The [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup") included a `portNumber` attribute for serial ports, although it is ignored and useless on players other than DiVA, HMP300 and HMP350.
* Color Emojis could sometimes be accidentally rendered in black and white.

*Applies to [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410") and [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440") players.*

* The "DSOS boot menu" boot option did not show the boot menu, instead it booted DSOS directly.
* The DMC firmware for the GPU on iBX410 and third-party players with Elkhart Lake processors was missing.
* Under rare circumstances, the synchronization of the multiple outputs on the iBX440 could be suboptimal due to CPU scheduling.
* Images in 8K would not display for 8K capable players, such as [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440").

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* The hardware watchdog was not available on [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [Intel NUC 8 Chaco Canyon](/wiki/Intel_NUC_8_Chaco_Canyon "Intel NUC 8 Chaco Canyon"), only the software watchdog was being used. *This was a regression introduced in 4.8.0.*

*Applies to [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* The bootloader would fail to load on systems which failed TPM measurement operations (e.g., due to buggy BIOS), making the system impossible to boot; this was a compatibility problem introduced in 4.7.5; now TPM measurement errors do not prevent booting.

  + Added the power source (PoE/USB) and power consumption info-boxes on [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W") (hardware revision dependent).
  + The source of each DSOS license is now shown, it can be either DSOS or content.
  + Replaced "Power" with "Status" in the DISPLAY tab popover to avoid ambiguity.
  + A warning is shown if the player time is off with respect to the browser time.
  + The check for firmware update is now asynchronous to avoid blocking the PHP server.
  + A warning dialog is displayed instead of the configuration wizard if no license is activated on a player.
  + The name "uploader" and names starting with a period are disallowed when a user is created to avoid conflicts with internal users.
  + When manual DNS is used, the DNS suffix is checked to make sure it is a valid domain name.
  + Reworked the [Output Streaming](/wiki/Advanced_applications_settings#Output_Streaming "Advanced applications settings") section for clarity.
  + The "Capture stream packets" option is removed on players that do not support streaming, i.e., on the HMP300 and on players that do not have a SYSTEMS license.
  + Added a "Web page data" option under the [Operations ⇾ Reset](/wiki/Operations#Reset "Operations") section, to clear the HTML rendering engine data (HTTP cache, HTTP web storage, cookies). The "Web storage" option has been renamed to "Shared variables".
  + The [display power management controls](/wiki/Display_and_audio_settings#Power "Display and audio settings") are now available on third party players.
* The net-snmp daemon is no longer started if SNMP is not enabled; previously it was always started but listening on only localhost by default.
* The system report now includes a decoded dump of the EDID from the screen for improved diagnostics.
* Added capability to select a particular audio track within a video file by setting the [`spx:audio`](/wiki/SVG#spx:audio "SVG") attribute to a language code (e.g., "ENG", "FRA", "SPA", etc.), "QAA" (for the original language), or "QAD" (for audio description).

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [iBX410](/wiki/IBX410 "IBX410"), [iBX440](/wiki/IBX440 "IBX440"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* Updated the HTML rendering engine to CEF / Chromium 95.
* Updated FFmpeg to version 4.4.3 for subtitles support and other improved video support.
* Updated GStreamer to version 1.20
* Added support for Opus [audio codec](/wiki/Audio_codec "Audio codec").
* Updated graphics stack to support Intel CPUs with Gen12 (Xe) GPUs.
* The intel-media-driver hardware acceleration decoders are now used on all Intel platforms, the legacy intel-vaapi-driver decoders have been removed since no longer used.
* The Linux kernel has been updated from version 5.4 to 5.15.
* Support for Thunderbolt / USB 4 devices has been added.
* The packaging of firmware files for Intel GPUs has been reworked so that only the ones necessary for the supported platforms are included in [DSOS](/wiki/DSOS "DSOS").

### Fixes

[Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center"):

* Added a check to prevent restoring a configuration if the passphrase or the secret key used when it was generated does not match the one configured on the player.
* Display power schedules with invalid on/off time configurations are now forbidden.
* When signing in, users with content right only are redirected to the user profile page, which is the only one they can access.
* DHCP was shown when a static address was configured.
* Applying a license would tell that a restart was needed even if the license failed.
* Was not using a private directory for the runtime directory.
* The timeout used to connect to DBus was too long and could cause long interruptions if ever the DBus system malfunctioned.

Others:

* Firmware updates could fail with an out of space error when the update included very large packages (e.g., libcef).
* Limit number of log messages for videos that cannot be decoded.
* Show correct bitstream header names in logs.
* [Status API](/wiki/Status_API "Status API") - the snapshotURI now points to the correct endpoint.
* Error message on invalid power off time contained incorrect data.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* The daemon that gathers data from the microcontroller would report spurious communication errors due an invalid CRC on some data patterns, this had no effect in the hardware functionality.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* Some of the ancillary filesystems used in DSOS could not store timestamps past 2038 due to limited inode size, and a warning was logged when mounting them; all newly created filesystems are now capable of storing timestamps past 2038.

*Applies to [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* The instant messaging service was not announced on Bonjour for these players.

### Developer

[jSignage API](/wiki/JSignage_API "JSignage API")

* Improved the RSS parsing by adding the support for retrieving the default media of a media object/group, defined with the "isDefault" attribute (used by Fox News RSS feeds, for instance).
* Replaced `setInterval` timer with an SVG timer in `jSignage.UI.fingerTouchClass` to prevent safe mode when using the `fingerTouch` animation within a multiscreen project. Increased the [JSignage UI plugin](/wiki/JSignage_UI_plugin "JSignage UI plugin") library version to 1.1.2.

[Configuration API](/wiki/Configuration_API "Configuration API")

* Removed the deprecated tags from the Configuration API, which are not used on models currently supported by DSOS.

[RPC API](/wiki/RPC_API "RPC API")

* Modified the `get_info` [RPC command](/wiki/RPC_command "RPC command") to report the power inputs data for the [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400")/[W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W") players, when the `power` flag is provided.

## Release 4.7.7 build 2

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.7 build 2. Release date: August 3rd, 2023.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.7-2.0.0-9170d2ea
### Fixes

* [Publishing](/wiki/Publish "Publish") or uploading a file larger than 1 GB failed with a "413 Request Entity Too Large" error. *This was a regression introduced in 4.7.7.*

## Release 4.7.7

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.7. Release date: June 13th, 2023.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.7-1.0.1-275a322e
### Improvements

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") now shows the status (e.g., configured, authenticated) of [802.1X](/wiki/802.1X "802.1X") on the Ethernet interface in the [Network settings](/wiki/Network_settings "Network settings") page.

### Fixes

* Control Center used low quality pseudo-random number generator in some cases, although they were not used for creating sensitive secrets; now all generated pseudo-random data comes from a cryptographically secure generator.
* Incomplete error handling in Control Center could leave temporary directories, and files within, behind; they are not properly removed when the operation completes, even in case of error.
* The firmware update component could incorrectly report and apply minor component updates when the update source (e.g., USB stick) was for a firmware version lower than already installed.

 *Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* [Video-in capture](/wiki/Video-in_capture "Video-in capture") was no longer working, this was a regression introduced in firmware 4.7.6.
* [Restoring a configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup#Restore_a_configuration_backup "Configuration backup") could sometimes fail with a "file extraction of config failed".
* The [Wi-Fi configuration wizard](/wiki/Wi-Fi_setup "Wi-Fi setup") would not allow to manually enter a network name (i.e., SSID) if there were no visible networks in range.
* Connecting to a network from the Wi-Fi configuration wizard could fail with a "Connection failed, check password" error, even if the password was correct, in particular if the network is hidden.

## Release 4.7.6

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.6. Release date: March 9th, 2023.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.6-1.0.1-b73dbc11
### Improvements

* The DSOS license data is now included in the response of the `get_info` command of the [RPC API](/wiki/RPC_API "RPC API") and in the [Status API](/wiki/Status_API "Status API").
* The [player configuration file](/wiki/Configuration_backup#config.xml "Configuration backup") is now included in the report when the report is uploaded to a server, via [Pull Mode](/wiki/Pull_Mode "Pull Mode").
* The [SNMP](/wiki/SNMP "SNMP") functionality is now available on all device models and no longer requires a [DSOS license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license").
* [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") is updated to version 2.13.0 which includes the same core libraries and component updates as firmware 4.7.6-1.0.1.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* Any fatal machine check exception (MCE) messages that cause an immediate reboot are now logged and decoded in the following boot to improve diagnostics.

### Fixes

* The player would reboot when the content referenced the player's own hostname, for instance to trigger an RPC command.
* Synchronization of audio and video could be off by a noticeable amount, in particular for streaming sources which use long-delay codecs.
* Fixed an issue where streaming sources which used MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) could freeze momentarily every few seconds, this occurred when the MPEG-2 TS only included PCR values every few seconds (violating MPEG-2 TS requirements) and the stream had variable bitrate; this is now avoided by using a more robust stream clock estimator.
* Streams with an incomplete description in their SDP could make the player reboot.
* In some particular conditions (unreliable network connections and feeds with large amounts of data) the jSignage feed cache could fill up resulting in an unhandled exception that would prevent retrying retrieving the feed.

 *Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players")*

* [802.1x](/wiki/802.1x "802.1x") and Wi-Fi enterprise authentication methods using client certificates with a private key (e.g., EAP-TLS) did not work due to a missing component needed to parse the certificates.

### Security

## Release 4.7.5 build 2

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.5 build 2. Release date: December 12th, 2022.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.5-2.0.0-b715b4e7
### Fixes

* Cross-origin requests to [RPC API](/wiki/RPC_API "RPC API") or [Web Storage REST API](/wiki/Web_Storage_REST_API "Web Storage REST API") using the API key returns CORS errors as if the API key was wrong, due to a build error. *This is a regression introduced in 4.7.5.*

## Release 4.7.5

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.5. Release date: November 10th, 2022.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.5-1.0.0-3dcdeed6
### Improvements

* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") now enforces password complexity to improve security, replacing the previous dictionary based password strength check. All passwords must now be at least 8 characters long, and have one upper case letter, one lower case, one digit and one special character. The password complexity check can no longer be disabled.
* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") and [RPC](/wiki/RPC "RPC") now recognize licenses distributed via the content, in addition to the traditional [DSOS license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license") installed out of band.
* The Enable ARYA / Disable ARYA button in Control Center's [Operations](/wiki/Operations "Operations") page has been removed, as it is a duplicate of the one in Control Center's main page and did not always reflect the current state of the player.
* [Accounting logs](/wiki/Accounting#Accounting.log "Accounting") now have an extended mode which have extra fields, including UTC timestamps and an on/off indicator in the "close" event which tells if the screen was on during all the time the media was played or if the screen was off during all or part of the time the media was played. This extended information is used by [ARYA](/wiki/ARYA "ARYA") for improved proof of play reports.
* The DSOS license data in the report now includes the source of the license (e.g., content or license file), to facilitate diagnostics.
* [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") is updated to version 2.12.1 which includes the same core libraries and component updates as firmware 4.7.5-1.0.0.
* The endpoints used for weather and feeds widgets can now be updated from the SpinetiX cloud, to support varying endpoints.
* Added support for Google Calendar event attachments.
* Added support for modern variations of RSS format, in particular the "isDefault" attribute used by FOXnews RSS feeds.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* mcelog is now included to decode Machine Check Exception data for improved diagnostics.

### Fixes

* Enabling or disabling ARYA from Control Center or via the RPC API would reset the enrollment configuration, instead of just changing the ARYA enablement state.
* [Audio](/wiki/Audio "Audio") was desynchronized from video, up to 100 to 200 milliseconds depending on the display; this is a regression introduced in 4.7.1.
* [Calendar widgets](/wiki/Calendar_widgets "Calendar widgets") - inline images from Exchange Online calendar events were discarded.
* [Yammer widgets](/wiki/Yammer_widgets "Yammer widgets") - URLs in Yammer posts were no longer detected in some Yammer installations.
* A crash would occur when adding an image layer with its URL pointing to an online PDF file.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* The graphics driver no longer loads on hardware for which are only experimentally supported, to avoid confusion.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* Repeated power events could crash the spxucd daemon and reboot the player.

*Applies to [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Probing of the installed [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") version failed on systems using SATA storage, as a consequence the Recovery Console was not updated on these players during [firmware update](/wiki/Firmware_update "Firmware update").

* Accessing Control Center's custom HTML interface pages by users which are not signed in to Control Center no longer causes a confusing browser authentication dialog to pop-up, users are now redirected to the Control Center sign in instead and then redirected to the custom HTML interface after successfully signing in. A new /uiauth/ path in the web server space is introduced to support this.
* USB storage is now available in Control Center on HMP400, HMP400W and third party players running DSOS regardless of the DSOS license installed. When no DSOS license is installed USB storage can only be used as storage extension, when a DSOS license is installed it can also be used to play content externally copied to the USB storage (e.g., from Elementi).
* Calendar widgets using Exchange online as data source now support showing images attached to the calendar event.
* Improved support for showing images from Yammer feeds.
* Projects using DarkSky as provider for weather information are now transparently redirected to the default provider since DarkSky no longer makes the data available.
* Redirect responses to HTTP requests from the content could be dropped if the body of the redirect was over more than one network packet.
* Recovery console is updated to version 2.11.0 which includes the same core libraries and component updates as firmware 4.7.4-1.0.1.

### Fixes

* The manual date and time menu in Control Center had the year drop-down limited to 2021.
* Pull mode would parse the response of a failed HTTP request to a server instead of ignoring it, possibly leading to stopping pull mode actions after a failed HTTP request (e.g., 502 error).
* The status API would show an error about a /srv/raperca/interface/public/index.svg file on HMP400, HMP400W and third party players; although there was no real error.
* The player could crash and reboot when changing the timezone configuration, depending on the newly selected timezone (Moscow would trigger it).
* The player could crash and reboot after publishing a project referencing some special timezones, like Moscow.
* Video streams with URLs ending in .sdp would not play, this is regression introduced in 4.7.0.
  + HMP400, HMP400W and third party players only
    - iwd from version 1.9 to 1.20.
      * Solves 802.1x compatibility with switches using 802.1x version 2010 (a.k.a. EAPoL version 3) by default.
      * Solves Wi-Fi issues with WPA3 authentication, roaming, scanning, authentication timeouts, and many other reliability issues.
    - linux-firmware: upgrade from 20210511 to 20211027
* HMP400 and HMP400W only
  + The spxucd daemon was not watched by the watchdog daemon.
* Third party players only
  + Ignore more patterns of dummy / uninitialized serial numbers in BIOS data, they could cause a failure to enroll in the SpinetiX cloud.

## Release 4.7.3

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.3. Release date: December 20th, 2021.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.3-1.0.0-aec8d491.
### Fixes

* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") immediately logged out a user when the player clock was not synchronized and more than 8 hours in the past, making it unusable and difficult to recover. *This was a regression introduced in firmware 4.7.2*
* The SNMP user configuration was not correctly processed, which had the following consequences:
  + If the community string was left at its default "public" value, then only the system MIB subtree was readable.
  + Changing the community string to anything else than "public" left the system MIB subtree still readable with the "public" community string, while the complete MIB tree was readable with the configured community string.
  + Limiting access to specific IP networks or addresses did not have an effect of the "public" community string.
* The SNMPv2-MIB reported a bogus value for contact and location instead of the empty value, which means "unknown".
* The processes and disk configuration of the UCD-SNMP-MIB was outdated, so some entries in the process table were being flagged in error, some other important ones were missing and some file systems (i.e. disks) were not being listed.
* The [custom interface](/wiki/Player_web_interface#Custom_HTML_interface "Player web interface") link in Control Center was not displayed if its title was longer than 20 bytes.
* The "Start Recovery Mode" button in the corrupted firmware message was non-functional.
* Corrected minor typos in Control Center messages.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* The daemon that reports information from the power management microcontroller was not started on the latest hardware revision (i.e. revision C); this did not have any functional consequence.

### Security

Updated core libraries and components, the main changes are as follows:

* apache2: updated to version 2.4.51
  + This fixes the following security vulnerabilities which affected the firmware: CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-34798
  + This fixes the following security vulnerabilities which did not affect the firmware: CVE-2021-31618, CVE-2020-13938, CVE-2019-17567, CVE-2021-39275, CVE-2021-36160, CVE-2021-33193, CVE-2021-41773, CVE-2021-41524 and CVE-2021-42013
  + Note that the following security vulnerabilities were already fixed in firmware 4.7.2 with backported fixes: CVE-2021-30641, CVE-2021-26690, CVE-2021-26691, CVE-2020-35452 and CVE-2020-13950
* nss: fixed CVE-2020-6829 and CVE-2020-12400

  + This fixes the following security vulnerabilities which did not affect the firmware: CVE-2020-36311, CVE-2021-3609, CVE-2021-3655, CVE-2021-38160, CVE-2021-38199, CVE-2021-37576, CVE-2021-38198, CVE-2021-38205, CVE-2021-38204, CVE-2021-3653, CVE-2021-3656 and CVE-2021-42008
  + Note that the security vulnerability CVE-2021-33909 was already fixed in firmware 4.7.2 with a backported fix.

### Unresolved

* The player goes to [Safe mode](/wiki/Safe_mode "Safe mode") when using [clock widgets](/wiki/Clock_widgets "Clock widgets") or [date widgets](/wiki/Date_widgets "Date widgets") set to Moscow timezone. The workaround is to set the time zone to UTC+03:00 instead.
* The date and time of the player can be manually set after disabling the "Automatic time from Internet (NTP)" option from [System → Date & Time](/wiki/System_settings#Date_.26_Time "System settings"), however, the year dropdown is limited to 2021. The workaround is to [boot the player into Recovery mode](/wiki/Recovery_mode#How_to_boot_the_player_into_Recovery_mode "Recovery mode"), click the "[Diagnostics](/wiki/Recovery_mode#Diagnostics_page "Recovery mode")" button at the top left, set the system date and time, and then reboot the player back to the normal [operating mode](/wiki/Operating_mode "Operating mode").

## Release 4.7.2

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.2. Release date: October 11th, 2021.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.2-1.0.1-577fb6de.
### Improvements

[Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center")

* The session duration has been changed to 8 hours (measured from sign-in) to ease usage, and a dialog is shown when the session expires.
* When more than one user exists in Control Center, the [player web interface](/wiki/Player_web_interface "Player web interface") sign-in page no longer unconditionally redirects to ARYA, even if the player is registered in ARYA.
* Power save scheduling options are no longer shown when [display power management](/wiki/Power_management#Display_power_saving "Power management") is disabled, to avoid confusion.
* The advanced configuration of loggers for diagnostics and debugging has been simplified and is now controlled via [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup") files. The respective page was removed from Control Center.

[Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") updated to version 2.10.1

* Includes same core libraries and component updates as firmware 4.7.2-1.0.
* A "firmware update" [splash screen](/wiki/Splash_screen "Splash screen") is shown during a [firmware update](/wiki/Firmware_update "Firmware update") via the recovery console (required during an update from firmware 4.6.x or older), instead of the "Recovery mode" default one, to avoid confusion.

Other improvements:

* The locale database (CLDR) was updated to release 39 for improved internationalization.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* The output volume of audio devices is now adjustable in Control Center's [Display & Audio page](/wiki/Display_and_audio_settings_on_HMP "Display and audio settings on HMP"), with 100% being the default.
* The list of Wi-Fi networks is now shown in Control Center's Network page, with signal quality and connected status.
* The Wi-Fi configurator now checks that the password length is valid for Wi-Fi.
* Improved compatibility of USB video capture devices (Sandberg USB2, Elgato Cam Link 4K, AverMedia ExtremeCap UVC, ATEN CamLive Uc3020) and extended the HDMI capture to support RAW mode. *This remains a [Technology Preview Feature](/wiki/Technology_Preview_Feature "Technology Preview Feature").*

### Changes

* The maximum [rendering latency](/wiki/Latency#Rendering_latency "Latency") is now limited to 1 second. A higher maximum rendering latency of 1500ms could be specified in earlier firmware versions, although the effective limit was often 1 second or less due to hardware constraints and in the cases where a higher latency was possible it interfered with the stream out feature. Any maximum rendering latency value higher than 1 second is now capped, and Control Center no longer proposes higher values; this applies to all player models to ensure consistency.

### Fixes

* When doing a [firmware update from a USB stick](/wiki/Update_the_firmware#Update_from_USB_drive "Update the firmware") and the firmware update required two passes, the second pass would update from the server and not the USB stick.
* Control Center generated a 500 internal error when the network logs of the uploader were enabled.
* Control Center could show some strings in languages other than English, although only English is supported.
* Literal IPv6 link-local addresses used in the NTP, DNS, default network API server, etc., were not working when the network was configured to use Wi-Fi instead of Ethernet.
* [Configuration files](/wiki/Configuration_files "Configuration files") that mixed Ethernet and Wi-Fi configuration could leave the network configuration in a wrong state, applying Ethernet configurations to Wi-Fi and vice-versa.
* Enrollment did not follow HTTP redirects received from the enrollment server, now 307 and 308 redirects are followed as expected.
* Double-clicks on an interactive widget inside a document were not correctly detected.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Control Center allowed configuring stream out in 4K but not all players are powerful enough to do it, 4K is thus no longer proposed on HMP400, HMP400W and third-party players like Chaco Canyon and ECS Liva Q2.
* The Output Streaming section was showing a "C:\fakepath\" string when uploading a custom XML file; only the base filename is shown now.
* The video stream from the stream out feature stuttered when stream out was configured at a lower resolution than the display and the display was configured at 4K (e.g., 1080p stream out with a 4K display).
* Some USB audio devices would not output audio because their default volume was too low, now all USB audio devices have their volume set to 100% by default.
* Taking a snapshot could briefly pause rendering, snapshots are now taken asynchronously to avoid this effect.
* Windows Hello compatible cameras could appear as two video input devices.

### Security

[Let's Encrypt certificate chain compatibility](/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt_certificate_chain_compatibility "Let's Encrypt certificate chain compatibility")

* Removed the expired root certificate "DST Root CA X3" used by Let's Encrypt for cross-signing its own root certificate. Having this certificate caused web page layers to stop rendering on HMP350 and HMP300 on 2021-09-30 for sites with certificates delivered by Let's Encrypt; other player models and other parts of the system were briefly affected by this issue.

* Updated core libraries and components, the main changes are as follows:
  + cairo: fixes for CVE-2020-35492, which can affect the firmware.
  + linux-firmware: upgrade from 20210208 to 20210511, fixes CVE-2020-26555, CVE-2020-26558 and CVE-2021-0105, which affected the firmware on some platforms.

* Added backported fix for CVE-2021-33909 (sequoia), the functions necessary to exploit it are not exposed on DSOS, so it is unlikely that DSOS was affected.

*Applies to [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA") players.*

* Although not accessible, the root account was not locked; it is now completely locked for increased security.

### Developer

[RPC API](/wiki/RPC_API "RPC API")

* RPC communication was non-functional when the "Password protect RPC admin" option was disabled, affecting communications with [Cockpit](/wiki/Cockpit "Cockpit"), [ARYA](/wiki/ARYA "ARYA") and any third-party RPC concentrator. *This is a regression introduced in 4.7.1.*
   This option is enabled by default, and disabling it is strongly discouraged (as it removes all security for player administration access).
   Users running firmware 4.7.1 that have disabled this option need to either update the firmware or re-enable the option from Control Center to recover the RPC functionality before updating the firmware.
* The firmware\_update ignored the `repo_uri` parameter when `repo_id` was not specified.
* A new parameter, `web-page-data`, added to the `reset` command, allowing to clear the web content related data (HTTP cache, HTTP web storage, cookies).

Fixed the following regressions introduced by the migration of [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300") and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA") players to the common software base of other player models in 4.7.1-1.0.1; the other players are not affected.

* The [serial port](/wiki/Serial_port "Serial port") was not working properly.
* Security vulnerability which could allow local user escalation (CVE-2021-38301).

## Release 4.7.1

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.1. Release date: June 2, 2021.
Firmware version number: 4.7.1-1.0.1-5ab720ce.

![Note](/w/images/thumb/6/60/Bulbgraph.png/18px-Bulbgraph.png "Note") **Note:**The 4.7.1 firmware is currently not available for [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"), pending the fix for the issue regarding the [serial port](/wiki/Serial_port "Serial port") not working properly.
### New

![Note](/w/images/b/b3/Info.png "Note") *This is a [Technology Preview Feature](/wiki/Technology_Preview_Feature "Technology Preview Feature").*

The [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players") now support the playback of content generated by audio/video capture devices connected through USB.

* These devices are accessible in the content using `videoin://` and `audioin://` scheme URIs.
* When multiple USB audio/video capture devices are plugged, they can be referenced through identifiable indexes in the URIs above, assigned to them from [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") ⇾ [Peripherals settings](/wiki/Peripherals_settings "Peripherals settings") or by using a [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup") file.
* [High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection "wikipedia:High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection") (HDCP) protected video-in signal is not supported.

### Changes

*Applies to [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA").*

* The [firmware](/wiki/Firmware "Firmware") for these player models is now built using the same software base (Yocto), as the [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400")/[W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W") players, so they benefit from all the security improvements and base services available on newer models.
  + All the features and fixes added in 4.7.0 which are not marked as being specific to other player models now apply to HMP350, HMP300 and DiVA players as well.
  + If an older version of the [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") is present, it will be updated through the regular [firmware update](/wiki/Firmware_update "Firmware update") process.
* The HTML rendering engine used on these players, PhantomJS, is now deprecated and may be removed in a future release as it is no longer maintained upstream. *See [SpinetiX-SA-21:01](/wiki/SpinetiX-SA-21%3A01 "SpinetiX-SA-21:01") for more details.*
* HMP350 and HMP300 players have ARYA enabled by default and maintain a connection to the SpinetiX cloud even when ARYA is not enabled, as it was already the case for DiVA players.

![Note](/w/images/thumb/c/c1/Warning_icon_yellow.png/18px-Warning_icon_yellow.png "Note") **Warning:**The [serial port](/wiki/Serial_port "Serial port") is not working properly on HMP350 and HMP300; deployments using the COM port should wait until a fix is made available before updating.
### Improvements

* Added support to [update the firmware](/wiki/Update_the_firmware "Update the firmware") using a package file (.pkg) found among the update files.
  + The player will automatically boot in [Recovery mode](/wiki/Recovery_mode "Recovery mode") to perform the update and will boot afterwards back in normal mode using the new firmware, the same configuration as before, and with all user data and previous logs preserved.
  + The firmware update process decides whether to use the pkg file or the normal update method based on firmware update compatibility requirements from the update files' metadata.
* During the [firmware update](/wiki/Firmware_update "Firmware update"), the [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") gets updated to version 2.9.5, featuring:
  + Added support for an automated firmware upgrade using a pkg file that preserves player configuration and user data, it is used to by the main firmware to do firmware updates that cannot be done using the normal method.
  + Added a Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) responder so that Windows systems can find the IP address of the player without registering the players in DNS.
  + [SDP / UPnP](/wiki/Device_discovery#SSDP_.2F_UPnP "Device discovery") announcements now use the hostname instead of the IP address when the LLMNR responder is not disabled.
  + AJAX requests to the recovery console's web server without authentication now return a 403 Forbidden message to avoid unexpected password prompt popups on browsers.
* Updated the iCalendar implementation library (libical) to version 3.0.7 (from 2.0.0).
* [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center")
  + Setting a user password which is in a dictionary of known passwords or that contains the username is now refused, unless the user consents to low security passwords, to protect against password spraying attacks; passwords in configuration backup files or set via RPC are not affected by these checks.
  + A single "invalid username or password" error is now displayed for both bad password and bad username, to avoid username probing attacks.
* [Widgets](/wiki/Widgets "Widgets")
  + The [Yammer widget](/wiki/Yammer_widgets "Yammer widgets") has been reworked to better reflect how message selection currently works on Yammer.
  + Requests for weather data using the [Yahoo Weather provider](/wiki/Weather_widgets#Channels "Weather widgets") are now re-routed to the default provider to ensure continuity of service, since Yahoo is discontinuing its weather service.
  + Percent encoding is now applied to all unreserved characters in URI query strings for better browser compatibility; for instance, this problem prevented some Twitter feed from being displayed.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Motion-JPEG videos are now decoded with the hardware accelerator when possible, reducing the CPU load for high resolution MJPEG videos.
* Audio echo cancellation in the HTML engine (disabled by default) can be enabled from [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") ⇾ [Advanced applications settings](/wiki/Advanced_applications_settings "Advanced applications settings") and/or via a [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup") file.

### Fixes

* A focus event for text input would not be generated if no physical keyboard was connected, making the use of virtual keyboards difficult.
* No caret is showed inside an editable text area.
* The title of an RSS feed was not shown if the title was multi-line and the first line was empty; now the first non-empty line is shown.
* The player can crash when a referenced image is missing from the content.
* Some types of H.264 interlaced videos could crash the player.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Firmware update from 4.5.0 directly to 4.7.0 breaks network name resolution after the first update step, effectively disconnecting players from any network services in most cases, and the second update step can never be completed (unless done from a USB stick); updates from firmware 4.5.1 or later to 4.7.0 are not affected. A workaround is now included that makes updating from 4.5.0 directly to 4.7.1 or later possible. A workaround was also put in place in SpinetiX's firmware update server on 2021-05-18 so that players with firmware 4.5.0 are first updated to 4.5.2 and only after that is 4.7.0 proposed for updates.
* Firmware update from a 4.5.0 beta version (4.5.0-0.7, 4.5.0-0.8 or 4.5.0-0.9) directly to 4.7.0 failed due to unsatisfied dependencies; this did not affect the 4.5.0 release version (4.5.0-1.0) nor any later firmware versions.
* Changing the [screen rotation](/wiki/Display_and_audio_settings_on_HMP#Display "Display and audio settings on HMP") configuration could make regular text become italics and vice-versa. *Regression introduced in 4.7.0.*
* Activation of a TPM bound license could fail due to a race condition with TPM bound license verification in other components.
* HTML rendering engine:
  + Solved bad quality and garbled audio when using WebRTC on HMP400 and other devices with similar CPU power, Webcams with integrated echo canceling are required for good audio quality.
  + Web pages that open new tabs following user interaction now navigate to the location of the new tab.
  + Detection of installed external apps to handle custom URL schemes used in HTML pages did not work as expected and left a blank page.
  + When attempting to navigate to non-http URLs (e.g., mailto) the HTML layer would become blank, such navigation requests are now ignored and only navigation within http URL scheme is allowed.
  + The player can crash if the web page in an HTML layer closes itself via JavaScript.
  + If the HTML engine rendering process crashed, it was not automatically restarted.
  + When the HTML engine's GPU rendering process restarted it would fall back to software rendering, decreasing rendering performance.
  + Mixing multi-touch interfaces in HTML layers with input elements in SVG layers would not work correctly.
  + The [logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs") from the HTML rendering engine (CEF) were not included in the [report](/wiki/Report "Report").
* [Streaming](/wiki/Streaming "Streaming"):
  + RTMP streaming would not start if it was the only stream-out protocol enabled.
  + The video output could stutter when stream-out was enabled.

*Applies to [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA").*

* The player would hang during boot if a [custom video mode](/wiki/Custom_display_settings#Custom_video_mode "Custom display settings") had width larger than 1920 or height larger than 2047, which is not supported by the hardware; such custom video modes are now refused.
* Some custom video modes with widths not multiple of 8 would fail due to a rounding error.
* The surfaces behind opaque videos could be painted even though they are not visible, resulting in a slightly reduced rendering performance.
* A surround sound option was shown in Control Center, when there is no support for surround sound or multi-channel audio in these players.

*Applies to [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* The name of the main storage device was incorrectly identified when firmware was newly installed from pkg file (regression introduced in 4.7.0-1.0.1-47e24bd6).

### Security

* Solved improper RPC user privilege verification; fixes CVE-2021-32034 and CVE-2021-32035.
* Strict mode for PHP sessions cookies was not enabled and made Control Center vulnerable to session fixation attacks (referenced as CWE-384), fixes CVE-2021-33817.
* Control Center did not correctly escape command arguments in some cases, which could potentially have been exploited by malicious configuration files or RPC calls, although no attack vectors are currently known.
* The directory where the APIs security keys are stored had too wide permissions, they have been narrowed to the strict minimum.

Updated kernel from version 5.4.90 to 5.4.106 to fix the following security issues:

* These could potentially affect the firmware: CVE-2021-3347, CVE-2021-3444 and CVE-2021-30002
* These do not affect the firmware: CVE-2021-3178, CVE-2021-3348, CVE-2021-26930, CVE-2021-26931, CVE-2021-26932, CVE-2020-25639, CVE-2021-27365, CVE-2021-27364, CVE-2021-27363, CVE-2021-28038, CVE-2021-28375, CVE-2021-33033, CVE-2021-29265, CVE-2021-28660

Updated core libraries and components, the main changes are as follows:

* Updated linux-firmware from version 20201218 to 20210208.
* Updated Intel microcode to from version 20201118 to 20210216, fixing CVE-2020-8698 and CVE-2020-8696 which do not affect HMP400 nor HMP400W hardware but may affect some third party players.
* curl: fixes for CVE-2020-8231, CVE-2020-8286, CVE-2021-22876 and CVE-2021-22890 which affected the firmware and CVE-2020-8284 and CVE-2020-8285, which did not affect the firmware.
* glibc: fixes for CVE-2020-29573, CVE-2019-25013, CVE-2021-3326, CVE-2020-27618 and CVE-2020-29562 which affected the firmware and CVE-2021-27645 which did not affect the firmware.
* ca-certificates: update from version 20190110 to 20210119.
* p11-kit: update from version 0.23.20 to 0.23.22; fixes CVE-2020-29361, CVE-2020-29362 and CVE-2020-29363, none of which affected the firmware.
* openssl: update from version 1.1.1i to 1.1.1k; fixes CVE-2021-3450, CVE-2021-3449, CVE-2021-23841 and CVE-2021-23840, which affected the firmware.
* bind: fix for CVE-2020-8625, which does not affect the firmware.
* wpa-supplicant: fixes for CVE-2021-0326, CVE-2021-27803 and CVE-2021-30004, none of which affected the firmware.
* giflib: fix for CVE-2019-15133, which affected the firmware.
* hostapd: fixes for CVE-2019-5061, CVE-2021-0326, CVE-2021-27803 and CVE-2021-30004, which affected the firmware.

### Developer

* The firmware updater now includes an `X-spinetix-firmware` header in all its HTTP requests, with the version of the running firmware as the value.
* The [embedded web server](/wiki/Embedded_web_server "Embedded web server") has a new `/getconfig` HTTP endpoint that returns the complete configuration backup like Control Center's "Get Config" button.
* [RPC API](/wiki/RPC_API "RPC API")
  + Calls that modify the configuration or player state were previously accepted during a firmware update, potentially leading to an inconsistent configuration or state; now a `FirmwareUpdateInProgress` exception is returned when an update is ongoing and should be retried later; other RPC calls are not affected.
  + The `firmware_update_status()` [command](/wiki/RPC_API#RPC_commands "RPC API") returns a new boolean property "applied\_on\_reboot" that is set to true when the update is actually applied during reboot and thus the reboot can take much longer than usual; also "done" property is set to true after the reboot following a firmware update completes, to ease chaining of RPC calls with firmware updates.
* [jSignage API](/wiki/JSignage_API "JSignage API") updated to version 1.6.1
  + Updated the log messages from `checkCacheData` and `updateCacheData` to improve expiration information.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* When the user clicks on an editable field on a webpage, a `virtualKeyboardRequest` event is generated in the parent SVG content so that a [virtual keyboard widget](/wiki/Interactive_widgets#Virtual_Keyboard "Interactive widgets") can be shown.

### Unresolved

* The [serial port](/wiki/Serial_port "Serial port") is not working properly on HMP350 and HMP300; deployments using the COM port should wait until a fix is made available before updating.
* The first access to [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") on a DiVA, HMP300, or HMP350 after a reboot could take up to 20 seconds; subsequent accesses are not affected.

## Release 4.7.0 build 2

Release name: "[Grand Pilier d'Angle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Pilier_d%27Angle "wikipedia:Grand Pilier d'Angle")" 4.7.0 build 2. Release date: March 22, 2021.
Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
Firmware version number: 4.7.0-2.0.0-1e3ba268.
### Fixes

* The player could reboot during a firmware update, which results in a corrupted firmware requiring reinstallation via the recovery console (regression introduced in 4.7.0); the probability of this occurring was high if a restart was initiated while a firmware update was in progress, it could also occur if a restart was not requested, but it was much less likely.
* Static IPv4 address configurations did not work, the duplicate address detection was faulty and concluded that the same IP address was already in use on the network (regression introduced in 4.7.0).
* Static IPv4 address configurations did not always detect when the IP address was already in use on the network.
* The built-in analog audio output for [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400")/[HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W") was not functional. *This regression was introduced in 4.7.0.*

### Unresolved

* When using [vertical CW screen orientation](/wiki/Display_and_audio_settings_on_HMP#Simple_configuration "Display and audio settings on HMP"), regular SVG text is displayed formatted as italic. The vertical CCW orientation is not affected. *This regression was introduced in 4.7.0.*

## Release 4.7.0

* Some content-related warnings were no longer in the [player.log](/wiki/Player.log "Player.log").
* The SNMP daemon had a TCP listening socked open on port 199 (smux) although no smux connections are supported, smux support is now completely disabled to avoid this.
* Notifications of the status of content update from [ARYA](/wiki/ARYA "ARYA") could fail due to lack of credentials when the content update took long.
* Actions triggered from the SpinetiX cloud (e.g., content updates) could be theoretically delayed by 60 seconds in exceptional circumstances.
* Uploader did include the necessary access token in retry queries to the SpinetiX cloud RPC concentrator when the first access failed.
* Uploader did not apply retry timeout with exponential backoff when there is a problem reaching the RPC concentrator.
* Firmware updater was too aggressive in cleaning oversize logs and useful logs were being lost on firmware updates.
* The report was missing display manager configuration.
* Underline might not show in some conditions in text areas.
* Minor fixes for iframe preview in browsers (removed borders and added configurable width and height)
* Player may crash under some circumstances due to JavaScript garbage collection.
* A minor memory leak occurred during video decoding with H.264 videos
* Audio on some web video services shown in HTML layers (e.g., Zattoo) was distorted.

## Release 4.6.4 build 2

Release name: "[Punta Giordani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Pyramid "wikipedia:Vincent Pyramid")" 4.6.4 build 2. Release date: January 11, 2021.
Firmware version numbers:

* [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players"): 4.6.4-2.0.0-5b7b83ec

### Fixes

* The default content contained a time-limited license expiring on 2021-07-31; the player would thus display a black screen when booted in factory defaults after this date.

## Release 4.6.4

Release name: "[Punta Giordani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Pyramid "wikipedia:Vincent Pyramid")" 4.6.4. Release date: December 18, 2020.
Firmware version numbers:

* [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players"): 4.6.4-1.0.1-7b3521a7
* [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"): 4.6.4-1.0.37289

### Fixes

* A problem with garbage collection of JavaScript objects could sometimes crash the player, this was more likely to occur with content that uses JavaScript heavily and the QR code generator.
* MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP and VC1 videos at 60 fps could freeze while playing.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* Revocation of a [DSOS license](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license") resulted in the revoked license being reinstalled from the copy in the persistent data store, this created no functional issue as the license is anyhow invalid and thus ignored but was confusing.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Some content combinations (video plus an animated widget on a solid background plus a fade transition on the entire layout) caused rendering errors.

## Release 4.6.3

Release name: "[Punta Giordani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Pyramid "wikipedia:Vincent Pyramid")" 4.6.3. Release date: December 7, 2020.
Firmware version numbers:

* [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players"): 4.6.3-1.0.1-f3b33994
* [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"): 4.6.3-1.0.37248

### Improvements

* In [Control Center > Advanced Applications](/wiki/Advanced_applications_settings "Advanced applications settings"), the "Webstorage API" and "RPC Security" sections have been merged into a single section named "APIs Security" to better convey their current use. Also, the "Enable RPC request using AJAX (CORS)" option has been renamed to "Enable CORS requests".

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* [DSOS licenses](/wiki/DSOS_license "DSOS license") now persist across a [reset to factory default settings](/wiki/Reset_to_factory_default_settings "Reset to factory default settings") or [firmware installation from the Recovery Console](/wiki/Install_the_firmware_in_Recovery_mode "Install the firmware in Recovery mode"). Also, they can now be bound to the TPM and can be revoked before their expiration date.

### Fixes

* The firmware updater would not retry downloading update packages when the source server indicates a temporary failure (e.g., an HTTP 503 service unavailable status), erroring out the firmware update request, it now retries several times after a delay.
* The firmware updater incorrectly included the device serial number in the user agent header of its HTTP requests, it now uses the same dedicated header as other firmware components.
* In some cases an HTTP request that received a redirect response could fail to follow the redirect
* Synthetized italic / oblique text was not slanted, regression introduced 4.5.0.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* The player [snapshot](/wiki/Snapshot "Snapshot") could sometime fail to be shown in Control Center.
* Changes to the ["Use external USB drive to store content" setting](/wiki/Peripherals_settings#USB "Peripherals settings") did not trigger a player restart, although it is required for the change to take effect.
* The [CEC engine](/wiki/Power_management#HDMI_CEC "Power management") could send an "on" command instead of "off" after the first two attempts for "off" failed.

*Applies to [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA").*

* The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) sent by the player to enroll to the SpinetiX cloud had an incorrect DER encoding for the version number, which beginning December 2020 is no longer accepted by the cloud infrastructure (an "Invalid CSR format" error is returned); as a result new HMP350, HMP300 and DiVA players could not be registered in ARYA. The correct encoding is now used and new players of these models can be registered in ARYA again.

### Security

* The [embedded web server](/wiki/Embedded_web_server "Embedded web server") did not protect against abuse of the Proxy header in requests (i.e., httpoxy vulnerabilities), although no vector of exploit is known.

### Developer

* The [jSignage](/wiki/JSignage "JSignage") `applyFormatDateNumber` function would crash if called with `null`.

## Release 4.6.2

Release name: "[Punta Giordani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Pyramid "wikipedia:Vincent Pyramid")" 4.6.2. Release date: November 12, 2020.
Firmware version numbers:

* [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players"): 4.6.2-1.0.0-676dc8fb
* [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"): 4.6.2-1.0.37011

### Improvements

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* Added support for analog [audio output](/wiki/Audio_output "Audio output") (using the SpinetiX USB-C analog audio cable SX-HW-UCAUD). This appears as "Built-in Audio Analog Output" in [Control Center](/wiki/Display_and_audio_settings_on_HMP#Audio "Display and audio settings on HMP").

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Known [audio output](/wiki/Audio_output "Audio output") options (e.g., audio over HDMI) are listed in [Control Center](/wiki/Display_and_audio_settings_on_HMP#Audio "Display and audio settings on HMP") even if the output is not currently available, to ease the player configuration.
* The [installation of the firmware from the Recovery Console](/wiki/Install_the_firmware_in_Recovery_mode "Install the firmware in Recovery mode") can now automatically recover from corruption in the environment blocks used to store boot parameters.

### Fixes

* Players could enter a reboot loop in some rare cases with very unstable networks due to timeouts on the ntp daemon handling logic.
* In some rare cases the [QR code generation in jSignage](/wiki/JSignage_QRCode_plugin "JSignage QRCode plugin") could fail with an exception.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* HDMI 2.0 displays could show no image if the HMP was rebooted while the display had no power.
* Communication errors with eMMC could generate I/O errors on the [internal storage](/wiki/Internal_storage "Internal storage") marking some filesystems as corrupted and cause unexpected reboots; the problem has been fixed and devices with filesystems marked as corrupted are automatically repaired after a firmware update.
* Removed the bogus error message about missing /usr/share/raperca/recipes.json.
* Removed the focus frame rendered around [HTML layers](/wiki/Elementi_layers#Web_page_layer "Elementi layers").
* Use of images in HTML could result in inconsistent image caching.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Power failures could leave uninitialized or old data in some files in the [internal storage](/wiki/Internal_storage "Internal storage") due to mishandling of the eMMC write cache.
* When [installing the firmware from the Recovery Console](/wiki/Install_the_firmware_in_Recovery_mode "Install the firmware in Recovery mode"), the installation did not clear existing boot settings (although none are set by any previous firmware version).

* The option to ignore certificate validation errors did not apply to HTML content.
* Rendering of [web content](/wiki/Web_content "Web content") could freeze after several days.
* Some types of HTML content caused an important memory leak.
* Scan and maintenance operations on the internal storage (eMMC) was not enabled.

*Applies to [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W") and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* During [Wi-Fi setup](/wiki/Wi-Fi_setup "Wi-Fi setup"), the configuration QR code and AP information would be shown twice when the power/[blue button](/wiki/Blue_button "Blue button") was pressed.

### Developer

The following [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") libraries have been updated:

### Developer

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* [RPC API](/wiki/RPC_API "RPC API") - new commands for Wi-Fi: `wifi_scan`, `wifi_connect`, `wifi_disconnect`, and `wifi_get_info`.

* [Calendar widgets](/wiki/Calendar_widgets "Calendar widgets") do not show data from Google.
* HMP400 serial number doesn't work as [Multiscreen ID](/wiki/Multiscreen_ID "Multiscreen ID")
   When [associating players to screens from Elementi](/wiki/Multiscreen_content#Associating_players_to_screens_from_Elementi "Multiscreen content"), the [player' serial number](/wiki/Player_identification#Serial_number "Player identification") is used as Multiscreen ID - this doesn't work for [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400")/[HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), so you need to manually [configure the multiscreen ID](/wiki/Multiscreen_ID#Configuration "Multiscreen ID") (for instance screen-1-1) on the player.

## Release 4.5.3

Release name: "[Matterhorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matterhorn "wikipedia:Matterhorn")" 4.5.3. Release date: July 20, 2020.
Firmware version numbers:

* [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players"): 4.5.3-1.0.1-992c2cc3
* [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"): 4.5.3-1.0.36475

### Improvements

* CORS requests are now allowed for endpoints other than RPC, provided the RPC API key is used.
* Changed the display message when the player license expires or is missing, now a black screen is shown instead of the "no valid license" floating text.

### Fixed

* The content server was not disabled when a player was added to ARYA, leading to confusing errors in Elementi if a publish was attempted.
* Importing X.509 server certificates with unknown extensions would make the network page display an error and be unusable until the certificate was removed.
* RTP (not MPEG2TS) streaming will stop after a few minutes.
* AJAX POST requests would use chunked transfer encoding since firmware 4.5.0, but many simple devices do not support them, which broke communications; now chunked transfer encoding is not used in AJAX requests.
* HTTP requests to server whose name started with vN, N being an integer, would be modified to be within square brackets, breaking the request

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Video modes could be incorrectly programmed when the attached display did not return a valid EDID, due to an internal DisplayPort link rate being incorrectly programmed.
* The hardware watchdog would not fire if the system hung during shutdown, as it got disabled when the software watchdog exited, now the hardware watchdog never disables.
* The unused rssProxy.php, i18njs.php and timezones.php were incorrectly included in the firmware image, which increases the attack surface, they are no longer included.

*Applies to [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), and [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA").*

* Visual stutter could occur with looping videos.
* Player could hang after video playback.

### Security

* Fixed CVE-2020-15809, the spxmanage component would allow requests that access unintended resources because of SSRF and Path Traversal.

### Unresolved

* The dropdown listing the time zones in [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center") is empty for [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").
   The workaround is to use the `<timezone>` [configuration tag](/wiki/Configuration_API#Configuration_tags "Configuration API"). *This is a regression introduced in 4.5.3 release.*
* No proxy support in HTML rendering engine.

## Release 4.5.2

Release name: "[Matterhorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matterhorn "wikipedia:Matterhorn")" 4.5.2. Release date: June 8, 2020.
Firmware version numbers:

* [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players"): 4.5.2-1.0.2-1eb2ffbd
* [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"): 4.5.2-1.0.36229

### Improvements

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* The [RTC](/wiki/RTC "RTC") is now calibrated for improved time accuracy while the player is powered off.

### Fixed

*Applies to all models.*

* [Facebook widgets](/wiki/Facebook_widgets "Facebook widgets") were no longer working due to a Facebook API change.
* The default gateway in [static IPv6 configurations](/wiki/Network_settings#IP_Configuration "Network settings") conflicted with IPv6 routes added from router advertisements resulting in unpredictable routing, the default gateway now uses a lower metric and has precedence.
* Fixed various minor presentation problems in [Control Center](/wiki/Control_Center "Control Center"), such as:
  + IPv6 addresses would appear truncated on the [NTP statistics](/wiki/NTP_statistics "NTP statistics").
  + The reason for the player reboot would appear as "unknown reason".
  + Removed the [MAC address](/wiki/MAC_address "MAC address") and CPU's ARM & DPS references from [player status information boxes](/wiki/HMP_Control_Center#Player_status "HMP Control Center").
  + Removed the [MAC address](/wiki/MAC_address "MAC address") from [IP Configuration section](/wiki/Network_settings#IP_Configuration "Network settings").

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* [Configurations deployed via USB sticks](/wiki/Configure_player_from_USB_stick "Configure player from USB stick") including a reboot directive could cause a reboot loop.
* [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") updated to version 2.8.1, fixing the player rebooting after a couple of minutes when a reset to factory defaults operation was pending.
* On [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), the local link IPv6 addresses in static DNS configurations would get the wrong interface identifier when Wi-Fi was the selected interface.

### Developer

* Enabling [capturing the HTTP traffic for Pull Mode](/wiki/Configuration_API#Configuration_tags "Configuration API") would generate no or incomplete capture files.
* HTTP PUT requests with an empty body where incorrectly done as GET requests.

* [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players"): 4.5.1-1.0.0-fef033e4
* [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA"): 4.5.1-1.0.36130

### New

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Enabled [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi") connections with support for personal (pre-shared key) and enterprise authentication, as well as open/unauthenticated networks. Wi-Fi is enabled from Control Center, and the configuration is done via a [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup") file.
* [Configurations can now be deployed via USB sticks](/wiki/Configure_player_from_USB_stick "Configure player from USB stick") - inserting a USB stick with a [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup") file on a not-yet configured player will automatically apply the configuration; this feature is automatically disabled once the player has been fully configured for security reasons.
* Added support for [802.1x](/wiki/802.1x "802.1x") authentication on Ethernet; configuration is done via the [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup") file.

### Improvements

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* The [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") has been updated to version 2.8.0, to support Wi-Fi connections and [802.1x](/wiki/802.1x "802.1x") authentication on Ethernet. The [Recovery Console](/wiki/Recovery_Console "Recovery Console") is now updated during the regular [firmware update](/wiki/Firmware_update "Firmware update"), if an older console version is installed on the player; also, it can now be [installed via a .pkg file](/wiki/Install_the_firmware_in_Recovery_mode "Install the firmware in Recovery mode"), just as the firmware.
* The player [report](/wiki/Report "Report") includes more readable license data to aid in diagnostics.

*Applies to [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* Names corresponding to the labels on the device are now shown in Control Center's video and audio output selectors.

### Changes

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400") and [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W").*

* Licenses were incorrectly included in the [configuration backup](/wiki/Configuration_backup "Configuration backup"), which can invalidate a valid license received from the license server when restoring the configuration backup at a later time; licenses are no longer included in the configuration backup as they are distributed directly by the license server. Configuration backups saved from firmware 4.5.0 for units which had a license should be manually edited to remove the license before restoring.

### Fixed

*Applies to all models.*

* [Streaming](/wiki/Streaming "Streaming") was not working properly with some sources.
* An [HTTP proxy](/wiki/HTTP_proxy "HTTP proxy") on port 80 could not be used. *This was a regression introduced in 4.5.0.*
* Some web services, like RSS feeds, behave differently when the referrer is about:blank, a full URL is now used to avoid problems.
* Solved incompatibility with myDrive.ch file storage service.
* Webp images could crash the player causing a reboot.
* RPC responses to failed calls were not returned to the RPC concentrator (*regression introduced in 4.5.0*); in addition any HTTP level RPC call errors are also returned to the RPC concentrator.
* The player could reboot during network state changes due to races in the restart of the NTP daemon.
* Credentials to access resources on AWS could be renewed just after they expired, instead of a few minutes before, causing temporary problems with ARYA.
* The license texts in Control Center's about page were not properly tagged as UTF-8 plain text and could display garbled.
* EULA and third-party licenses updated to reflect current ones.

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* On full HD deinterlaced videos, the bottom of the 1088 coded lines were outputted instead of the top 1080.
* The player was not restarted when the audio configuration changed, although a restart was required.
* Network default routes installed by the DHCP client may conflict with existing default routes and not become effective, they are now replaced.
* The NTP daemon no longer restarts on IP address changes as it is no longer necessary.
* The report did not properly dump the TPM2 public data of persistent handles.

### Developer

*Applies to all [players](/wiki/Players "Players").*

* [Configuration API](/wiki/Configuration_API "Configuration API") new tags: `wired-auth-add` and `wired-auth-reset` for [Ethernet 802.1x authentication](/wiki/802.1X_Port-Based_Network_Access_Control "802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control").

*Applies to [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), and [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players").*

* [Configuration API](/wiki/Configuration_API "Configuration API") new tags: `wifi-dhcp`, `wifi-static`, `wifi-v6-none`, `wifi-v6-static`, `wifi-ap-add`, and `wifi-ap-reset`.
* [RPC API](/wiki/RPC_API "RPC API") - the `get_info` command has been extended to support Wi-Fi.
* [Status API](/wiki/Status_API "Status API") - the [`info` endpoint](/wiki/Status_API#info "Status API") has been extended to support Wi-Fi.

## RSS proxy server-side request forgery (SSRF) and path traversal

| Affected Products | Severity | Fixed Release Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [HMP400](/wiki/HMP400 "HMP400"), [HMP400W](/wiki/HMP400W "HMP400W"), [third-party players](/wiki/Third-party_players "Third-party players") | Medium | Affected component removed in firmware 4.5.3. Upgrade to [firmware 4.5.3](/wiki/DSOS_release_notes#Release_4.5.3 "DSOS release notes") and later. |
| [HMP350](/wiki/HMP350 "HMP350"), [HMP300](/wiki/HMP300 "HMP300"), [DiVA](/wiki/DiVA "DiVA") | Medium | Partial fix in firmware 4.5.3 and extended fix in 4.6.0. Upgrade to [firmware 4.6.0](/wiki/DSOS_release_notes#Release_4.6.0 "DSOS release notes") and later. |

### Mitigation

Exploiting the attack requires authentication with a user with admin or content edit rights. Using proper passwords for all users mitigates the attack.

### Details

The RSS proxy service (rssProxy.php endpoint) lacked proper validation of the URI parameter and was susceptible to path traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. An attacker could obtain access to protected player files or make requests to internal player services posing as localhost, potentially disclosing protected data. This is partially mitigated by the fact that the script runs with limited rights and the exploit requires to be authenticated as a user with admin or content edit rights.

The URI validation fix in firmware 4.5.3 fixed path traversal and the most obvious SSRF attacks but failed to cover other cases like HTTP redirects to protected resources. Firmware 4.6.0 extends the validation to carefully validate all HTTP redirects. The URI validation in firmware 4.6.0 is still vulnerable to time of check to time of use based attacks using short-lived DNS records, but exploiting it is significantly more difficult and gives no access to otherwise protected information.

The RSS proxy service (rssProxy.php endpoint) is no longer included in the firmware for HMP400, HMP400W and DSOS on third party devices as it is not needed on these devices. It remains included in the firmware for DiVA, HMP300 and HMP350 devices as it is used by the content management interface included in these devices.

CVE-2020-15809

* CVSS Base Score: 6.5 (medium)
* CVSS v3.1 Vector: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

### Acknowledgment

SpinetiX thanks Smaury from Shielder Srl for reporting the issue and collaboration in reviewing the fixes.

### Revisions

1. March 22, 2021: Initial public release
2. March 27, 2021: Updated CVSS base score and vector to match NVD
