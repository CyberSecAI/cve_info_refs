Affected CVE

CVE-2020-15379

**Summary

Security Advisory ID : BSA-2021-1319

Component : Brocade SANnav

Revision : 1.0: Final**

Brocade SANnav before v.2.1.0a could allow remote attackers cause a denial-of-service condition due to a lack of proper validation, of the length of user-supplied data as name for custom field name.

**Note:**When custom fields are added through the Inventory Custom Field Management pages, user-supplied values are not properly escaped, resulting in data corruption.  After the data is corrupted, additional requests cause the data to inflate, resulting in a resource exhaustion condition that causes SANnav to become unavailable until the data is cleared.

**Affected Products**

Brocade SANnav before v.2.1.0a.

**Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable**

No other Brocade Fibre Channel Products from Broadcom products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

**Solution.**

A security update is provided in Brocade SANnav v.2.1.0a

**Credit.**

The issue was found through internal penetration testing.
