- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when creating a custom field name in Brocade SANnav. Also, user-supplied values are not properly escaped when custom fields are added through the Inventory Custom Field Management pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation and lack of proper data sanitization or escaping, leading to data corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. After data corruption, additional requests cause the data to inflate, leading to resource exhaustion and making SANnav unavailable until the data is cleared.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing overly long or malicious data as custom field names through the Inventory Custom Field Management pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Brocade SANnav application and create custom fields. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the server.
