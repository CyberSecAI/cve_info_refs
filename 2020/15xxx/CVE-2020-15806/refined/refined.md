Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-15806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled memory allocation in the CODESYS Control runtime system. Specifically, it occurs in the `CmpVisuServer` component when handling `SRV_VISU_REGISTERCLIENT` requests sent to the `/WebVisuV3` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The `CmpVisuServer` component allocates memory buffers on the heap for each binary tag specified in an `SRV_VISU_REGISTERCLIENT` request. However, it overwrites the pointer to the previously allocated buffer when processing subsequent tags without freeing the old memory.
- **Memory Leak:** Because the overwritten memory is not freed, a memory leak occurs with each request containing multiple tags. Only the last allocated buffer's pointer is stored and freed.
- **Lack of Proper Resource Management:** The issue lies in the component's inability to properly manage allocated heap memory, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly sending specially crafted requests with multiple binary tags can exhaust the available memory, causing the CODESYS runtime system to fail memory allocation and leading to a denial of service. This can result in the system becoming unresponsive and impacting its availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the CODESYS web server.
- **Specially Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers craft the `SRV_VISU_REGISTERCLIENT` request within HTTP headers, specifying multiple binary tags, which triggers the memory leak in the `CmpVisuServer` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the CODESYS web server hosting the vulnerable runtime system.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP requests containing the `SRV_VISU_REGISTERCLIENT` with multiple binary tags.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability without any authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all CODESYS V3 runtime systems before version 3.5.16.10.
- The memory leak can be triggered through the `/WebVisuV3` endpoint.
- The attacker can send a series of HTTP requests to cause memory exhaustion.
- The size of HTTP headers might limit the number of binary tags within one request, so multiple requests might be necessary to fully exploit the vulnerability.
- Although there seems to be some kind of memory garbage collection mechanism, the attacker can still force the allocation failure.

**Solution:**
- The vulnerability is resolved in CODESYS V3.5.16.10. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later.
