Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of content validation in SuiteCRM when processing SVG files. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate the content of uploaded SVG files, allowing an attacker to embed malicious code within them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. The application allows an attacker to inject a URL into the SVG file, which is then used to redirect the user to an arbitrary external site when the SVG file is viewed.
*  **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The root cause is that SuiteCRM does not properly validate or sanitize the content of the uploaded SVG file. This allows arbitrary JavaScript code (in this case, `window.location`) to be executed when the file is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing pages, malware download sites, or other malicious websites.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** A successful redirect can be used as a stepping stone for other types of attacks, such as credential theft or drive-by downloads.
*   **Trust Violation:** By redirecting users to unexpected sites, attackers can erode trust in the SuiteCRM application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted SVG file to the "Documents" module of SuiteCRM.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to view the content of the uploaded SVG file (by clicking the "eye" icon).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to SuiteCRM:** The attacker needs to have an account or have access to upload files to the Documents module of SuiteCRM.
*   **Ability to Craft SVG Files:** The attacker needs the knowledge to create or modify SVG files to include the malicious payload (JavaScript for redirection).
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special user privileges or administrative access beyond the ability to upload a document.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) includes a sample SVG file and details on how to exploit the vulnerability
