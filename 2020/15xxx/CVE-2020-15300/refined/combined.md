### Description

SuiteCRM
application has an open redirect vulnerability due to the lack of content
validation that specifies link to an external site. The vulnerability can be
exploited by uploading a specially crafted SVG file with an external URL. Then
the vulnerability is triggered when the user views the documentÂ´s content.

The following payload was successfully submitted to the server in the SVG file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<svg
onload="window.location='https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/'" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
</svg>
### Exploitation Process

The following screenshot shows the âDocumentsâ module which allows users to upload files.

To exploit the vulnerability, a specially crafted SVG file is needed. The following screenshot shows the content of the âredirect.svgâ file. As it can be observed, the payload provides an URL where the user will be redirected to.

After following the redirection, the content of the file can be displayed by clicking the âeyeâ symbol shown in the screenshot below:

After clicking the eye symbol, a new browser tab is opened and the user is redirected to the URL provided in the SVG file content. The following screenshots show that the âRefererâ header points to the Documentâs preview URL.
