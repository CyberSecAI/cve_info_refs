Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15309:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a potential cache-timing attack that can be performed against public key operations when single-precision (SP) is not used in wolfSSL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cache-timing side-channel vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists when wolfSSL is not using single precision (SP) mode.
-  Specifically, this attack targets public key operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local attackers can extract sensitive information.
- If the affected system was used for private key operations (like signing with a private key) the attacker may gain access to these private keys.
- The attacker can potentially extract an RSA key, as demonstrated in the provided paper.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is a cache-timing attack, exploiting timing differences in cache access.
- The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to execute code on the same system where wolfSSL is running.
- The attack can be performed without explicit synchronization between the attacker and the victim (asynchronous).
- The attack does not require special privileges to execute.
- A specific timing technique is used to accurately control cache evictions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code locally on the system running wolfSSL.
- Knowledge of cache-timing attack techniques.
- Must be on a system where wolfSSL is not using single-precision mode, and where private key operations are performed.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is mitigated by using single-precision (SP) mode in wolfSSL. The release notes for wolfSSL version 4.5.0 mention that single-precision EC operations should be used to mitigate side-channel attacks when using SGX, and the release defaults to using single precision for SGX builds.
*   **Paper:** A research paper titled "CACHE SNIPER: Accurate timing control of cache evictions" (arXiv:2008.12188) details a novel attack technique that was used to exploit this vulnerability, including a description of how an RSA key was extracted from wolfSSL.
*   **Affected Versions:** wolfSSL versions prior to 4.5.0 are vulnerable when single precision is not used.
*   **Patched Versions:** The issue is fixed in wolfSSL version 4.5.0.
*   **Affected Code:** The vulnerability is related to the public key operations when single precision (SP) is not used.
