Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incomplete validation of input shapes in the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` implementation. Specifically, the `grad_values_t` tensor's shape was not validated to be a vector, while its counterpart `reverse_index_map_t` shape was validated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper shape validation for `grad_values_t` tensor in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` leads to an assertion failure in the `vec` function call when a non-vector shape is passed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to a crash caused by an assertion failure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious users can craft a `grad_values_t` tensor with an invalid shape (non-vector) and pass it as input to the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the input tensors passed to the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` operation.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is related to GHSA-63xm-rx5p-xvqr and considered a variant of it.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `390611e` ([https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54)).
- Patched versions include 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, and 2.3.1.
- The vulnerability exists in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.3.0.
- The fix includes adding a check for the shape of `grad_values_t` to ensure it is a vector before accessing it with `vec<T>()`.
- This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, including specific code locations and attack details.
