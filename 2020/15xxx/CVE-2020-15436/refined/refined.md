Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15436:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2020-15436 and describes it as a Linux kernel vulnerability. The description from lkml.org aligns with the CVE. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   *   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition within the `blkdev_get()` function in the Linux kernel. Specifically, after calling `__blkdev_get()`, the function accesses the block device (`bdev`) even if `__blkdev_get()` had an error, released the `bdev`'s reference count, and called `bdput()`. If the released refcount was the last one, subsequent access of `bdev` results in a use-after-free condition.

   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is a **use-after-free**. The `blkdev_get()` function doesn't properly check the result of `__blkdev_get()` before attempting to access the block device and its members. This leads to accessing memory that has already been freed by a `bdput()` call.

   *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a **use-after-free**, which can manifest as a crash or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.  The provided KASAN log shows a read access violation indicating a crash of the `syz-executor.0` process. NetApp also mentions the potential for "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS)."

   *   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific race condition involving multiple CPUs and operations such as `blkdev_open`, `remove disk`, `bd_acquire`, `blkdev_get`, `__blkdev_get`, `del_gendisk`, `bdev_unhash_inode`, `bd_forget` and `bdput`, as described in the provided lkml.org email. Specifically, the sequence involves the following:

      1.  Multiple CPUs attempt `blkdev_open`.
      2.  A different CPU removes a disk, leading to  `del_gendisk` and `bdev_unhash_inode`.
      3.  `__blkdev_get` in one CPU fails due to the unhashed inode
      4.  `bdput` is called due to the error.
      5.  If this `bdput` call releases the last reference of `bdev`, further access of `bdev` in the originating `blkdev_get` call results in use after free.
      This detailed scenario was provided in the lkml content and provides additional insight than the CVE itself.

   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to trigger the specific sequence of calls and race conditions, as described. This is likely achievable through crafted system calls or through a kernel fuzzer which can cause such races. The NetApp advisory mentions "local access" in the CVSS vector, but the lkml.org discussion suggest the use-after-free can be triggered through normal device operations, specifically in multithreaded environments.
