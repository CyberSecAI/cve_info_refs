Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing token check in the "remove request" functionality within the `com_privacy` component of Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The absence of a token check allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that can be executed by an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially remove privacy requests, impacting the user's data privacy controls and potentially leading to unauthorized data access. This is considered a low impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF Attack:** The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to unknowingly submit a crafted request, such as by embedding a link or form in a malicious website or email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Target User Login:** The attacker must target an authenticated user already logged into a vulnerable Joomla! installation.
- **Social Engineering (for user interaction):** The attacker would need to employ social engineering tactics to trick the victim into executing the forged request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions are Joomla! CMS 3.9.0 to 3.9.19.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Joomla! version 3.9.20.
