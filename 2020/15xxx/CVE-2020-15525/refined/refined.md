Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a bypass in GitLab's Workhorse component, specifically in how it handles URL paths with encoded forward slashes (`%2f`).  Workhorse incorrectly interprets `%2f` as `/` in the URL, leading to a path traversal issue when combined with the `file.path` or `file.remote_id` parameters in the Maven Repository APIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is path traversal. By manipulating the project path in the URL with encoded forward slashes and appending `file.path` with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../..`), an attacker could access files outside the intended scope.
*   **Workhorse Bypass:** Workhorse does not properly normalize or validate the URL path, which allows the bypass of the authorization checks further down in the Rails application.
*   **Insecure File Access:**  The vulnerability can be exploited to access system files (through `file.path`) and enumerate objects stored in object storage (through `file.remote_id`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially disclose the existence and contents of files on the GitLab server, specifically in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Object Storage Enumeration:**  The vulnerability allows attackers to enumerate objects in object storage.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP PUT Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP PUT request to the Maven package upload endpoint.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The URL must be crafted to include the encoded forward slashes (`%2f`) in the project path.
*   **Parameter Injection:** The request includes the `file.path` (for file system access) or `file.remote_id` (for object storage access) parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **GitLab User:** The attacker needs to be a valid GitLab user with the ability to access the Maven Repository API, specifically through an API token
*   **Knowledge of Project ID:** The attacker needs to know a project ID to construct the malicious URL.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the GitLab server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported via HackerOne by `ledz1996`.
*   The issue is similar to previous Workhorse bypass issues (#848415 and #876998).
*   The vulnerability affects GitLab EE versions 11.3 and later.
*   GitLab versions 13.1.3, 13.0.9, and 12.10.14 contain patches to address this vulnerability.
*   The fix caused a regression in Maven package uploads in version 12.10.14.
*   A 500 status code indicates the file/object does not exist, while a 400 status code indicates that it exists, which can be used for enumeration.
