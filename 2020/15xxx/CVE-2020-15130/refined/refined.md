{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in the validation logic for NFT1 child genesis transactions. Specifically, the validator was not properly verifying that a parent NFT1 group token had been burned, as required by the NFT1 specification, leading to false positives.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of NFT1 child genesis transactions. The validator failed to enforce the requirement that the parent NFT1 token be burned during the child token's creation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could create seemingly valid NFT1 child tokens without burning the corresponding NFT1 group tokens, leading to the potential for the proliferation of invalid tokens. This could undermine the security and integrity of the token system, allowing for the creation of counterfeit tokens.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting and submitting transactions that generate NFT1 child tokens while circumventing the burn requirement for the parent NFT1 tokens.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft and broadcast specially formatted transactions. No privileged access to the system is required, so this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by anyone who can construct a transaction that appears valid to the vulnerable software."
