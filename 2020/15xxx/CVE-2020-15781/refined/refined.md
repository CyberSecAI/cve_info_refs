- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The login screen does not sufficiently sanitize input, allowing an attacker to generate specially crafted log messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the web application. Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser session when the victim views the crafted log messages.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the device's web server. The attack involves injecting malicious code into log messages via the login screen.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the device and the ability to interact with the login screen to inject malicious log messages. The attacker also needs a victim to view the log messages via a web browser.
