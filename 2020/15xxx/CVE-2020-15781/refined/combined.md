SUMMARY

The latest update for SICAM A8000 RTUs ﬁxes a vulnerability that could allow attackers with network
access to the device’s web server to perform a stored Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

Siemens has released an update for SICAM A8000 RTUs and recommends to update as soon as
possible.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SICAM WEB ﬁrmware for SICAM A8000 RTUs:
All versions < V05.30

Update to V05.30.
Applying the update causes the device / module
to go through a single restart cycle.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to port 443/tcp.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SICAM A8000 RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) series is a modular device range for telecontrol and
automation applications in all areas of energy supply.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15781

The login screen does not sufﬁciently sanitize input, which enables an attacker to generate specially
crafted log messages. If an unsuspecting victim views the log messages via the web browser, these
log messages might be interpreted and executed as code by the web application. This Cross-Site-
Scripting (XSS) vulnerability might compromize the conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the web
application.
