Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2020-15470 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow
*   **Location:** `ffjpeg/src/jfif.c:516` inside the `jfif_decode()` function.
*   **Root Cause:** A `memcpy` call within a loop copies data into a buffer (`idst`) using a stride (`yuv_stride[c]`). The size of the copy (8 * sizeof(int)) is fixed, but the stride calculation or buffer size allocation is flawed, leading to writing beyond the allocated buffer when `idst += yuv_stride[c]` is executed repeatedly.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted JPEG image.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious JPEG image to the application using the ffjpeg library.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The vulnerable code snippet is:

    ```c
    for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
    memcpy(idst, isrc, 8 * sizeof(int));
    idst += yuv_stride[c];
    isrc += 8;
    }
    ```

    *   The report includes AddressSanitizer output showing a heap-buffer-overflow during the `memcpy` operation within `jfif_decode`.
    *   GDB debugging output showing a segmentation fault.
    *   A link to a PoC (Proof of Concept) exploit.
