{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not randomize the session ID and reuses the same session ID across logins and logouts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Session fixation vulnerability due to predictable and reused session IDs.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can set a user's session ID and take control of the user's account.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can set a crafted session ID for the victim before they log in, then hijack that session after the victim authenticates.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to set the session ID (likely via a crafted link or by injecting it into the user's browser) before the victim logs in, and also be able to observe or predict session IDs."
