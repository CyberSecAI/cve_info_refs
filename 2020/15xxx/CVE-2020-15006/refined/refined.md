Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of uploaded logo file content in the `logo-upload.php` script. The script only checks the file extension/suffix but does not validate the actual content of the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Because the application does not validate file content, an attacker can upload a malicious file containing JavaScript or HTML code. This malicious code gets stored on the server and executes when other users view the page where the logo is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in User Browsers:** A successful XSS exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who access the affected page. This code can be used to:
  - Steal session cookies, potentially hijacking user accounts.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Modify the content of the displayed page.
  - Perform other actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the logo upload functionality provided by the `logo-upload.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application with the capability to upload a logo file.
- **Malicious File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file containing JavaScript or HTML code that is disguised as a logo file.
