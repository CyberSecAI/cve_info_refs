Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-12400 and CVE-2020-15665:

**CVE-2020-12400**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the modular inversion function used during the conversion of elliptic curve coordinates from projective to affine representations. Specifically, the P-384 and P-521 implementations used a side-channel vulnerable modular inversion algorithm based on binary GCD, while P-256 used a side-channel resistant Fermat's Little Theorem based approach.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Side-Channel Vulnerability:** The binary GCD algorithm used for modular inversion in P-384 and P-521 implementations leaks information through timing variations.
    *   **Non-Constant Time Operation:** The modular inversion was not performed in constant time, making it susceptible to timing attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with the ability to observe the timing of the modular inversion operation could potentially extract sensitive information, including the private key.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Side-Channel Attack:** This is a local side-channel vulnerability, meaning the attacker needs to be able to monitor the timing of operations on the machine where the vulnerable code is executing. It is not something that can be detected directly over the internet.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to measure the timing of the modular inversion function calls during elliptic curve operations. This is generally a local attack.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The P-256 implementation was not vulnerable as it used a constant-time modular inversion.
    *   The fix involved replacing the vulnerable modular inversion function with a constant-time implementation.
    *   The vulnerability is present in the NSS library which is used by various Mozilla products as well as other software like libreswan VPN, making it a potentially broad concern.

**CVE-2020-15665**

*   **Root Cause:** Firefox failed to reset the address bar after a `beforeunload` dialog was shown and the user chose to stay on the page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The address bar was not updated when a user chose to "stay on page" after a `beforeunload` prompt, leaving a misleading URL in the address bar.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this in conjunction with other browser quirks/vulnerabilities to create a misleading URL in the address bar, potentially tricking a user into thinking they are on a legitimate site when they are actually on a malicious one.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Web-based Attack:** A malicious webpage could trigger a `beforeunload` event, change the displayed URL, and then when the user cancels the navigation and stays on page, the browser will not update the address bar to reflect the current actual URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control a webpage and induce the `beforeunload` prompt.
*   **Additional Information:**
    * This issue was related to a chain of other not-quite-right things that resulted in an address bar spoofing vulnerability
    * The fix involved ensuring the URL bar is updated correctly when cancelling a navigation via `beforeunload` prompt.
