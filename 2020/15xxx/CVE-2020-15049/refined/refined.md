{
  "CVE-2020-15049": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation in Squid's `ContentLengthInterpreter.cc` when processing HTTP requests. Specifically, the `Content-Length` header field-value was not properly validated for prefixes such as \"+\" , \"-\" or unusual whitespace.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "HTTP Request Smuggling",
	  "Cache Poisoning"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a request smuggling attack, leading to cache poisoning. This allows the attacker to inject malicious content into the cache, which could then be served to other users. This can lead to arbitrary content injection and potential browser script bypass.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
       "Specifically crafted HTTP requests with malformed Content-Length headers"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Squid proxy and potentially needs a trusted client position to initiate this attack."
