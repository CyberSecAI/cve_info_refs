  "patched_versions": "1.4.3",
    "more_information": "The issue is related to the handling of the COTP message length field. If a message is received with a COTP message length field less than 4, an integer underflow occurs, which leads to a heap buffer overflow during message processing. The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker sending a specially crafted message, and can lead to a crash or remote code execution. The fix is in commit 033ab5b. Users should upgrade to 1.4.3, or apply the commit to their version.",
