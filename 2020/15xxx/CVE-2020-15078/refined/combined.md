| [Description](#c0)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-04-22 21:06:55 UTC  ``` This affects both 2.4.x and 2.5.x. Fixed versions are 2.4.11 and 2.5.2 respectively. Here's the snippet from the announcement: The OpenVPN community project team is proud to release OpenVPN 2.5.2. It fixes two related security vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-15078) which under very specific circumstances allow tricking a server using delayed authentication (plugin or management) into returning a PUSH_REPLY before the AUTH_FAILED message, which can possibly be used to gather information about a VPN setup. In combination with --auth-gen-token or a user-specific token auth solution it can be possible to get access to a VPN with an otherwise-invalid account. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-04-26 15:51:23 UTC  ``` ping ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Ionen Wolkens   gentoo-dev  2021-04-28 12:30:47 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 786423](show_bug.cgi?id=786423 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - net-vpn/openvpn 2.4.9 and 2.5.1 affected by security bug") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Antonio Quartulli    2021-04-29 07:46:06 UTC  ``` Hi there, is there something I could do to help with this?  The vulnerability has a public CVE and its impact is non-negligible for servers.  For the future: is there something the openvpn developers can do to communicate *beforehand* that a release with a security fix is coming? This way gentoo maintainers can be prepared.  I know other distros join a specific distribution list - but I am not sure if that's the case for gentoo.  Thanks! ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2021-04-30 15:26:30 UTC  ``` I will contact you via email. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-04-30 18:59:00 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=0355870fe3eb0f5d105bca9404a21a34e5649256>  commit 0355870fe3eb0f5d105bca9404a21a34e5649256 Author:     Thomas Deutschmann <whissi@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-04-30 18:12:50 +0000 Commit:     Thomas Deutschmann <whissi@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-04-30 18:58:34 +0000      net-vpn/openvpn: bump to v2.5.2          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/785115>     Package-Manager: Portage-3.0.18, Repoman-3.0.3     Signed-off-by: Thomas Deutschmann <whissi@gentoo.org>   net-vpn/openvpn/Manifest             |   1 +  net-vpn/openvpn/openvpn-2.5.2.ebuild | 174 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 files changed, 175 insertions(+) ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-01 14:06:36 UTC  ``` arm64 done ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-01 14:07:29 UTC  ``` x86 done ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-01 17:12:51 UTC  ``` ppc64 done ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-01 17:13:02 UTC  ``` ppc done ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-01 17:14:11 UTC  ``` amd64 done ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-04 19:14:03 UTC  ``` arm done  all arches done ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-04 19:14:19 UTC  ``` Please cleanup. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-05-24 01:19:24 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=a0f872033e85edb4868f76650fa205cd7d10bd07>  commit a0f872033e85edb4868f76650fa205cd7d10bd07 Author:     Thomas Deutschmann <whissi@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-05-24 01:16:04 +0000 Commit:     Thomas Deutschmann <whissi@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-05-24 01:19:18 +0000      net-vpn/openvpn: security cleanup          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/785115>     Package-Manager: Portage-3.0.18, Repoman-3.0.3     Signed-off-by: Thomas Deutschmann <whissi@gentoo.org>   net-vpn/openvpn/Manifest                |   3 -  net-vpn/openvpn/openvpn-2.4.9.ebuild    | 170 -------------------------------  net-vpn/openvpn/openvpn-2.5.0-r1.ebuild | 169 -------------------------------  net-vpn/openvpn/openvpn-2.5.1-r1.ebuild | 171 --------------------------------  4 files changed, 513 deletions(-) ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2021-05-24 01:20:49 UTC  ``` New GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2021-05-26 09:51:43 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 202105-25 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-25> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ``` |  |

CVE ID         : CVE-2017-12166 CVE-2020-11810 CVE-2020-15078 CVE-2022-0547

Several issues were discovered in OpenVPN, a Virtual Private Network server
and client, that could lead to authentication bypass when using deferred
auth plugins.

Note that this upload disables support for multiple deferred auth plugins,
following the upstream fix for CVE-2022-0547.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.0-6+deb9u4.

# USN-4933-1: OpenVPN vulnerabilities

4 May 2021

Several security issues were fixed in OpenVPN.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 21.04](/security/notices?release=hirsute)
* [Ubuntu 20.10](/security/notices?release=groovy)
* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [openvpn](/security/cves?package=openvpn) - virtual private network software

## Details

It was discovered that OpenVPN incorrectly handled certain data channel v2

packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject packets

using a victim's peer-id. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. ([CVE-2020-11810](/security/CVE-2020-11810))

It was discovered that OpenVPN incorrectly handled deferred authentication.

When a server is configured to use deferred authentication, a remote

attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass authentication and access

control channel data. ([CVE-2020-15078](/security/CVE-2020-15078))

### Reduce your security exposure

[openvpn](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/openvpn):
virtual private network daemon

OpenVPN is an application to securely tunnel IP networks over a

 single UDP or TCP port. It can be used to access remote sites, make

 secure point-to-point connections, enhance wireless security, etc.

 .

 OpenVPN uses all of the encryption, authentication, and certification

 features provided by the OpenSSL library (any cipher, key size, or

 HMAC digest).

 .

 OpenVPN may use static, pre-shared keys or TLS-based dynamic key exchange. It

 also supports VPNs with dynamic endpoints (DHCP or dial-up clients), tunnels

 over NAT or connection-oriented stateful firewalls (such as Linux's iptables).
