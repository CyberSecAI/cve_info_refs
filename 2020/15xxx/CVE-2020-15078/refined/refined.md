Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of deferred authentication within OpenVPN. Specifically, a server using delayed authentication (via a plugin or management interface) could be tricked into sending a `PUSH_REPLY` message before an `AUTH_FAILED` message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the possibility to bypass authentication due to the server incorrectly sequencing authentication messages.
- **Information Leak:** This bypass can lead to access control channel data, and potentially further information leaks.
- **Timing Issue:** The vulnerability exploits a timing issue where the server sends a PUSH_REPLY before it properly completes the authentication and is able to return AUTH_FAILED.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized VPN Access:**  In combination with `--auth-gen-token` or user-specific token-based authentication systems, it may be possible for an attacker to gain access to a VPN with an otherwise invalid account.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker may gain access to the control channel data, which can lead to information leaks about the VPN setup.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Specific Configuration:** Requires the OpenVPN server to be configured with deferred authentication enabled (via plugin or management interface).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the OpenVPN server.
- **Knowledge of Timing Issue:** The attacker needs to be aware of the timing issue and how to manipulate the authentication flow.
- **Potential Knowledge of Authentication Mechanism:**  Exploitation may be easier with some knowledge of the server's authentication mechanisms (e.g., use of `--auth-gen-token` or user-specific token authentication)

**Summary of relevant information:**

The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of authentication messages when deferred authentication is used in OpenVPN.  An attacker could possibly bypass the authentication process and potentially gain access to the VPN and sensitive information related to the VPN configuration. This vulnerability is present in OpenVPN versions prior to 2.5.2 and 2.4.11. Patches were issued to resolve this vulnerability in versions 2.4.11 and 2.5.2. The exploit is remote and requires specific server configuration (deferred auth).
