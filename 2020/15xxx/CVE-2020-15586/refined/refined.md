Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2020-15586:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a data race condition within the `net/http` package of the Go programming language. This data race occurs when a server concurrently attempts to read a request body and write a response. The `httputil.ReverseProxy` handler is specifically identified as being affected by this issue.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Data Race:** Concurrent read and write operations on shared memory (the buffered writer) within the `net/http` package lead to unpredictable behavior, including program crashes.
-   **Incomplete X.509 certificate verification on Windows:** If `VerifyOptions.Roots` equals nil, then the verification process will ignore the `VerifyOptions.KeyUsages` EKU requirements on Windows systems which results in incomplete X.509 verification.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious client sending specially crafted HTTP requests with the `Expect: 100-continue` header can trigger the data race, causing the affected Go server (e.g., the `Gorouter` in Cloud Foundry) to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network requests.
-   **HTTP Request Header:** Specifically, the `Expect: 100-continue` header in HTTP requests is used to trigger the vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
-   **Crafted Request:** The attacker needs to send requests with the specific `Expect: 100-continue` header.
-   **Concurrency:** Exploitation may be more reliable under concurrent request load.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was fixed in Go versions 1.13.13 and 1.14.5.
*   The vulnerability is present in older versions of the Go language (prior to 1.13.13 and 1.14.5).
*   The vulnerability is related to how `net/http` package handles `Expect: 100-continue` header, and a race condition occurs when there's a concurrent read and write of the connection's buffered writer.
*   Some of the provided content also includes information on the fix for CVE-2020-14039 (incomplete X.509 verification).
*   Various Linux distributions and products (SUSE, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat) were affected and released patches to address this vulnerability.
*   Cloud Foundry also released a security advisory regarding this issue, which affects its Gorouter component.
*   NetApp products are explicitly stated as **NOT AFFECTED** by this CVE.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Go standard library's net/http package and is not specific to any operating system, however the fix for CVE-2020-14039 is Windows-specific.
