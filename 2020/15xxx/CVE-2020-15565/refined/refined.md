Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient cache write-back in the Xen hypervisor when using Intel VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O). Specifically, when large page mappings are split into smaller ones, changes to shared page tables between the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and the CPU are not properly synchronized, causing stale data to be accessed. This is due to a missing write-back of cached data to memory before flushing the IOMMU TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient cache write-back:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of proper cache coherence management between the CPU and IOMMU when page tables are shared and modified, leading to the potential exposure of stale cached data.
*   **Page Table Sharing:** The vulnerability is triggered when page table sharing between IOMMU and CPU is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest OS can cause the host to crash due to the improper synchronization when splitting large page mappings, leading to a Denial of Service affecting the entire system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability may allow a malicious guest to retain read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool which could lead to privilege escalation, potentially allowing a malicious guest to gain control over the host system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious guest could access sensitive information belonging to other guests through the DMA vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest OS:** The attack vector is a malicious guest OS running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
*   **DMA access:** Specifically, the vulnerability allows the attacker to gain DMA read/write access to frames.
*   **VT-d:** The vulnerability is specific to system using Intel VT-d technology.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest User Privilege:** The attacker needs to have control of a guest OS and have the ability to modify memory mappings.
*   **Specific Hardware:** The host system must be using an x86 Intel CPU with VT-d and IOMMU.
*   **Specific Xen Configuration:** The vulnerable Xen setup must have hardware-assisted paging (HAP) enabled on x86 HVM guests with a passed-through PCI device and page table sharing between IOMMU and CPU.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Systems:**  Xen versions from at least 3.2 up to 4.13.x are affected.
*   **Unaffected Architectures:** x86 AMD as well as ARM systems are not affected.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by:
    *   Disabling page table sharing (`iommu=no-sharept` Xen command-line option or per-guest option in libxl config file).
    *   Disabling large HAP pages (`hap_2mb=no` and `hap_1gb=no` Xen command-line options).
    *   Avoiding passing through PCI devices to HVM guests.
