Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from multiple information disclosure issues in the "Forgot Password" and login functionalities of the Sulu CMS. These issues are:
1. **Information Leakage on Invalid User Input:** The "Forgot Password" feature discloses whether a provided username/email exists by returning a 400 error with a specific message when the user is not found. This allows enumeration of existing usernames.
2.  **Email Disclosure in Password Reset:** When a valid user requests a password reset, the system exposes the user's email address in the response. This allows attackers to gather valid email addresses.
3. **Timing Attack during Login:** The response time of the login process differs significantly depending on whether a username exists, allowing an attacker to infer the existence of usernames through timing attacks.
4. **Un-hashed Reset Tokens:** The reset token generated during the "Forgot Password" process is stored in the database without being hashed, making it vulnerable to exposure if an attacker gains access to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Leaking information about existing users, including email addresses, through error messages, and the reset password process.
*   **Timing Side-Channel:**  Login response time differences reveal information about user existence.
*   **Insecure Storage:**  Storing reset tokens in plain text within the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Enumeration:** Attackers can determine valid usernames.
*   **Email Harvesting:** Attackers can harvest email addresses of users.
*   **Database Exposure**: If database access is obtained, plaintext reset tokens can be read.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through network requests to the application's login and password reset endpoints.
*   **Database Access (for reset tokens):** Database access is a prerequisite to reading the unhashed reset tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the application's login and "Forgot Password" features.
*   **Database Access (for reset tokens):** For the reset token issue, attacker requires some form of access to the database.
