The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15944.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user input when creating new filters in the "Gantt-Chart for Jira" module. Specifically, the name of a filter is not sanitized which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) exists because user-supplied filter names are not sanitized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they load a dashboard containing the vulnerable Gantt-Chart module.
- As indicated in the advisory, this could also be used to attack other users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be authenticated.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) and uses it as the filter name.
- The malicious filter is saved.
- When a user loads a dashboard that contains the vulnerable Gantt-Chart module, the stored XSS payload is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Jira instance where the vulnerable module is installed.
- The attacker needs the ability to create new filters within the Gantt-Chart module.
