        "details": "The vulnerability occurs when a website uses a custom cursor and an endless JavaScript loop, and thus mouse events aren't being handled. The check for custom cursor bounds is done in the child process, which is blocked by the loop. The browserâ€™s process hang monitor notification is also affected by the custom cursor overlay, thus preventing the user from force-stopping the execution. This is most effective when the browser is in full screen mode."
