{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The webpack-subresource-integrity plugin, in version 1.5.0, incorrectly generates integrity hashes for dynamically loaded chunks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect generation of integrity hashes",
      "The integrity attribute for dynamically injected tags is set to 'undefined', bypassing the Subresource Integrity (SRI) check"
    ],
    "impact": "Dynamically loaded chunks are loaded without proper integrity validation, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code by modifying the chunk. This bypasses the protection that SRI should provide.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can potentially modify dynamically loaded Javascript files hosted on a CDN or other location"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the dynamically loaded Javascript files before they are loaded by a user's browser."

    "1.5.0"
