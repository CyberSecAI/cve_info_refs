The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15473.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a potential heap-buffer-overflow in the `ndpi_search_openvpn` function within the nDPI library. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code calculates the offset into the OpenVPN packet payload when checking for session ID.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: Incorrect offset calculation `offset += 1 + alen * 4` within the `ndpi_search_openvpn` function may lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow could lead to a crash, denial-of-service or potentially arbitrary code execution on the system if exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted OpenVPN packets that manipulate the `alen` value or the `hmac_size` to produce an out-of-bounds read when accessing the session ID

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject or manipulate OpenVPN packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker may need to have a network position to intercept and manipulate OpenVPN communication.
