The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15320.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of hardcoded, backdoor accounts within the MySQL database. These accounts have static credentials, and some are even accessible from specific external IP addresses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded MySQL user accounts and passwords.
- Multiple 'root' accounts with the same password, accessible from specific IPs and localhost.
- `livedbuser` account with hardcoded credentials (`axzyxel`).
- `zyxel` account with a hardcoded password hash.
- `debian-sys-maint` account with a hardcoded password.
- Use of these accounts in various parts of the system, including `collectd`, TR-069 solutions, and Python code.
- Exposure of credentials in configuration files with incorrect permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full database access, potentially leading to data breaches.
- Potential for further compromise of the system via database manipulation.
- Potential for lateral movement through access to other services.
- Potential for complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the appliance via command injection or shell access.
- Remote access from specific IPs allowed by the configuration (if reachable).
- Abuse of other vulnerabilities that allow command execution and database access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to connect to the MySQL service either locally or from the specific allowed IPs in the config.
- Knowledge or discovery of the hardcoded credentials.
- Ability to leverage another vulnerability (like an RCE) to gain access to the system and use the hardcoded credentials.
