The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15064.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The server name parameter in the web interface of the Digitus da-70254 USB network server is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The server embeds the server name into a JavaScript file without proper filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the server name parameter of the Digitus da-70254 device.
- Lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding for the server name parameter within the device's web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
- This can lead to persistent access to the web interface.
- Potential for further attacks on other systems within the local network through the compromised browser session of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the server name field.
- The malicious script is stored on the device and served back to users who access the device's web interface.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the web administration interface, causing the malicious JavaScript to execute in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Digitus da-70254 USB network server.
- Initially, the attacker might need administrative access to the web interface to change the server name. However, when chained with an authentication bypass vulnerability, this is not required.
