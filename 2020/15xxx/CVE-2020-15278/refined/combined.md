# Overview

Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable. This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need
to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot,
new best friend or all of these together!

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

* Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
* Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
* Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
* Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Picarto)
* Bank (slot machine, user credits)
* Custom commands
* Imgur/gif search
* Admin automation (self-role assignment, cross-server announcements, mod-mail reports)
* Customisable command permissions

**Additionally, other [plugins](#plugins) (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing
community of cog repositories.**

# Installation

**The following platforms are officially supported:**

* [Windows](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/windows.html)
* [MacOS](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/mac.html)
* [Most major linux distributions](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/install_guides/index.html)

If after reading the guide you are still experiencing issues, feel free to join the
[Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/red) and ask in the **#support** channel for help.

# Plugins

Red is fully modular, allowing you to load and unload plugins of your choice, and install 3rd party
plugins directly from Discord! A few examples are:

* Cleverbot integration (talk to Red and she talks back)
* Ban sync
* Welcome messages
* Casino
* Reaction roles
* Slow Mode
* AniList
* And much, much more!

Feel free to take a [peek](https://index.discord.red) at a list of
available 3rd party cogs!

# Join the community!

**Red** is in continuous development, and it’s supported by an active community which produces new
content (cogs/plugins) for everyone to enjoy. New features are constantly added. If you can’t
[find](https://index.discord.red) the cog you’re looking for,
consult our [guide](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/guide_cog_creation.html) on
building your own cogs!

# Unauthorized privilege escalation in Mod module

Moderate

[Jackenmen](/Jackenmen)
published
GHSA-mp9m-g7qj-6vqr
Oct 27, 2020

## Package

pip

red-discordbot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=3.4.0

## Patched versions

3.4.1

## Description

### Impact

An unauthorized privilege escalation exploit has been discovered in the Mod module: this exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in.

### Patches

This exploit has been fixed on version & `3.4.1`.

### Workarounds

Unloading the Mod module with `unload mod` **or**, disabling the `massban` command with `command disable global massban` can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to `3.4.1` to completely patch this issue.
