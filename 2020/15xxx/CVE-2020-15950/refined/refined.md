The provided content relates to CVE-2020-15950.

**Root Cause:** The Immuta application did not invalidate session authorization tokens upon user logout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper session management: Session tokens remain valid even after user logout.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has obtained a valid session token (e.g., through other vulnerabilities such as XSS) can continue to use that token to access the application, even after the legitimate user has logged out.
- The attacker can maintain persistent access until the token expires.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can obtain a valid session token through other vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
- An attacker could also obtain a session token if they had brief access to the victim's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid session token through means such as XSS or brief physical access to a user's machine.
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by replaying the captured token.
