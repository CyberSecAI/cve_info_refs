{
  "CVE-2020-15177": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The `install/install.php` endpoint in GLPI insecurely stores user input into the database as `url_base` and `url_base_api`. These settings are referenced throughout the application and allow for vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Redirection.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user input before storing it in the database. Specifically, the `url_base` and `url_base_api` settings are vulnerable.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insecure Redirection"
    ],
     "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can modify the `url_base` and `url_base_api` settings, leading to XSS and insecure redirection. Exploiting XSS can allow the attacker to steal cookies, perform actions as the user, etc.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can directly send requests to the `install/install.php` endpoint to modify the vulnerable settings.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
