# GLPI Unauthenticated Stored XSS

Moderate

[trasher](/trasher)
published
GHSA-prvh-9m4h-4m79
Oct 7, 2020

## Package

glpi

## Affected versions

>= 0.65

## Patched versions

9.5.2

## Description

The `install/install.php` endpoint insecurely stores user input into the database as `url_base` and `url_base_api`. These settings are referenced throughout the application and allow for vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Redirection

### Impact

Since authentication is not required to perform these changes,anyone could point these fields at malicious websites or form input in a way to trigger XSS. Leveraging JavaScript it’s possible to steal cookies, perform actions as the user, etc...

### Patches

TODO

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

Email us at glpi-security@ow2.org

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15177

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
