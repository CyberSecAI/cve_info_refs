Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15223:

**1. Verification of CVE relation:**

   - The provided GitHub security advisory directly mentions `CVE-2020-15223` as the CVE ID associated with the described vulnerability.
   - The advisory title "Token revokation incorrectly ignores storage errors" aligns with the description of the vulnerability found in the code diffs.
   - Therefore, the content is directly related to CVE-2020-15223.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The `TokenRevocationHandler` in the `fosite` library was not properly handling errors returned by the storage layer during token revocation. Specifically, it was ignoring storage errors and returning a successful HTTP 200 status code even when the revocation had not actually succeeded.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Incorrect Error Handling:** The core issue is the lack of proper error checking in the `RevokeToken` function. If the underlying storage mechanism failed to revoke a token, the function was still returning a success response.
   - **Violation of RFC 7009:**  RFC 7009 specifies that a 503 HTTP status code should be returned when the server encounters a problem during token revocation, which was not adhered to.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Token Persistence:** A successful exploitation could lead to a situation where tokens that should have been revoked remain valid, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
    - **False Success:** Clients would receive a 200 OK response, incorrectly believing the token was invalidated.
   - **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the application and the nature of the tokens, this could potentially lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to protected resources.
   - **Abuse of Abandoned Tokens:** The advisory mentions that this behavior prevents a situation in which there is still a valid authorization grant for a particular client of which the end-user is not aware, which relates to the root cause of the vulnerability.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - An attacker could potentially trigger errors in the storage layer during token revocation to keep tokens active, potentially by exploiting storage system failures, resource exhaustion, or by submitting many revocation requests to cause an overload, however the advisory states that the ability to trigger errors in the store is necessary for exploitation.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Ability to Revoke Tokens:** The attacker must have the ability to initiate token revocation requests, indicating they must be an authorized client.
   - **Trigger Storage Errors:** The attacker needs to find a way to cause the storage layer to return errors when trying to revoke a token. The advisory notes that whether the attacker can exploit the vulnerability is dependent on their ability to cause these storage errors.

**Additional Information from the Diff:**

- The fix involves:
    - Removing `fosite.ErrRevocationClientMismatch` which was not part of the RFC 6749 spec.
    - Returning `fosite.ErrUnauthorizedClient` when the OAuth2 client doesn't match.
    - Introducing `storeErrorsToRevocationError` which checks if either refresh or access token revocation has failed to return an appropriate error.
    - The test cases now cover the storage error cases, ensuring that errors are properly handled.

In summary, CVE-2020-15223 highlights a flaw in the error handling logic of the token revocation process in the `fosite` library. This could allow malicious actors to keep tokens active despite attempted revocations, by triggering storage layer errors. The fix addresses the incorrect error handling and ensures that a 503 status code is returned when storage errors occur.
