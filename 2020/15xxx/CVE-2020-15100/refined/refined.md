Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `freewvs` application attempting to read an entire file into memory without any size limitation. This allows a malicious user to create a large file that `freewvs` tries to read, leading to excessive memory consumption and termination of the scan process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unbounded file read: The application reads the entire file content into memory without checking the file size, leading to a potential denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the application's scanning process to terminate by providing a large file, effectively disrupting the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File Input: An attacker can introduce a specially crafted, excessively large file as input to the `freewvs` application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply files that `freewvs` will attempt to process. This could be through various means, including direct upload, or by placing it in a directory scanned by `freewvs`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `freewvs` versions `<= 0.1.0`.
- The fix was implemented by limiting the amount of data read from the file (specifically, to 200,000 bytes).
- The CVE is rated as low severity.
- The patch is available at commit [`18bbf20`](https://github.com/schokokeksorg/freewvs/commit/18bbf2043e53f69e0119d24f8ae4edb274afb9b2)
