Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_dashboard.php` file of the CentOS Web Panel. It occurs because the application fails to properly validate user-supplied input for the `ai_service` parameter before using it in a system call.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The lack of input validation allows an attacker to insert arbitrary commands into the system call.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected CentOS Web Panel installation. This means the attacker could gain complete control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote and through the web interface. The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a malicious `ai_service` parameter to `ajax_dashboard.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required, making the attack vector very accessible.
