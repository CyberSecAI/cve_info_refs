Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15036:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the NeDi application. Specifically, the `dv` parameter on the `Topology-Linked.php` page is vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This means that the malicious script is injected through the URL and executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities that can be performed with JavaScript.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript in the `dv` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the malicious link, or have the link executed in the user's browser by other means.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the user who is a victim must have logged in to the application.
