# NodeBB Blog Comments

Lets NodeBB act as a comments engine/widget for your blog. Currently supports both [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). There is a separate repo for [PencilBlue](https://github.com/theunknownartisthour/nodebb-comments-pencilblue) support. If you'd like to see support for other CMS/blog systems, please submit an issue on our tracker.

The comments are exposed to any plugin you have built into the core, so it is completely possible to have emoticons, embedded video, and/or whatever else you want in the comments section of your blog.

Articles are published to a forum category of your choice, and will gain a tag that links it back to the original article.

## What's new in 0.8x

* The WP-JSON plugin is no longer required. This plugin will now use the built-in JSON API.
* The comments snippet has changed, please update your integration code as necessary
* Fixed a bug that caused errors when no [ACAO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header was defined

## Upgrading to 0.6x

Getting `Unexpected end of JSON input` for `/comments/publish`? On your blog's post template (ex. `post.hbs` for Ghost) where you have installed the blog comments script, find the following line:

```
<script id="nbb-markdown" type="text/markdown">{{../post.markdown}}</script>

```

and above, add:

```
<script id="nbb-title" type="text/markdown">{{../post.title}}</script>

```
## What's new in 0.3x

* Fixed quite a few server crashes (especially when publishing)
* Compatible with NodeBB 0.6x+ and Ghost 0.5.10
* Added tags support for Ghost
* Added comment support in general

## Installation

First install the plugin:

```
npm install nodebb-plugin-blog-comments

```

Activate the plugin in the ACP and reboot NodeBB. Head over to the Blog Comments section in the ACP and select the Category ID you'd like to publish your blog content to (default is Category 1). Make sure you put the correct URL to your blog.

### Ghost Installation

Paste this any where in `yourtheme/post.hbs`, somewhere between `{{#post}}` and `{{/post}}`. All you have to edit is line 3 (`nbb.url`) - put the URL to your NodeBB forum's home page here.

```
<a id="nodebb-comments"></a>
<script type="text/javascript">
var nbb = {};
nbb.url = '//your.nodebb.com'; // EDIT THIS
nbb.cid = 1;	// OPTIONAL. Forces a Category ID in NodeBB.
				//  Omit it to fallback to specified IDs in the admin panel.

(function() {
nbb.articleID = '{{../post.id}}';
nbb.tags = [{{#../post.tags}}"{{name}}",{{/../post.tags}}];
nbb.script = document.createElement('script'); nbb.script.type = 'text/javascript'; nbb.script.async = true;
nbb.script.src = nbb.url + '/plugins/nodebb-plugin-blog-comments/lib/ghost.js';
(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(nbb.script);
})();
</script>
<script id="nbb-title" type="text/markdown">{{../post.title}}</script>
<script id="nbb-markdown" type="text/markdown">{{../post.markdown}}</script>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view comments</noscript>
```

If you wish, you can move `<a id="nodebb-comments"></a>` to where you want to place the actual comments widget.

### Wordpress Installation

Replace the contents of `/wp-content/themes/YOUR_THEME/comments.php` with the following (back-up the old comments.php, just in case):

```
<?php
if ( post_password_required() )
	return;
?>

<a id="nodebb-comments"></a>
<script type="text/javascript">
	const nodeBBURL = '//your.nodebb.com';
	const wordpressURL = '<?php get_site_url(); ?>';
	const articleID = \''.get_the_ID().'\';
	const categoryID = null; 	// OPTIONAL. Forces a Category ID in NodeBB.
								//  Omit it to fallback to specified IDs in the admin panel.

	(function() {
	var nbb = document.createElement('script'); nbb.type = 'text/javascript'; nbb.async = true;
	nbb.src = nodeBBURL + '/plugins/nodebb-plugin-blog-comments/lib/wordpress.js';
	(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(nbb);
	})();
</script>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view comments</noscript>
```
### General - PHP example

Paste this any where that you want load commenting system. All you have to edit is line 3 (`nodeBBURL`) - put the URL to your NodeBB forum's home page here. You can also use any template engine (hbs, eco...) instead of PHP.

```
	<a id="nodebb-comments"></a>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	var nodeBBURL = '//your.nodebb.com',

	<?php
		echo "articleID = " .getId().";";
		$obj = new stdClass();
		$obj->title_plain = "";
		$obj->url="";
		$obj->tags = [];
		$obj->markDownContent= "";
		$obj->cid = 1; // OPTIONAL. Forces a Category ID in NodeBB.
						// Omit it to fallback to specified IDs in the admin panel.
		echo "var articleData =" .json_encode($obj).";";
	?>

	(function() {
	var nbb = document.createElement('script'); nbb.type = 'text/javascript'; nbb.async = true;
	nbb.src = nodeBBURL + '/plugins/nodebb-plugin-blog-comments/lib/generalphp.js';
	(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(nbb);
	})();
	</script>
	<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view comments</noscript>
```

You must have some getId() function on your website, for example:

**For a PHP website**

```
    <?php
        function getId(){
            $id = 0;
            // unique id for each page of your website
            return $id;
        }
    ?>
```

If you don't have such ID, you can use this function that generates a unique ID from the URL:

```
    <?php
        function getId(){
            return stringToInteger($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
        }
        function stringToInteger($string) {
            $string = md5($string);
            $output = '1';
            for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($string); $i++) {
                $output .= (string) ord($string[$i]);
            }
            return (int) $output;
        }
    ?>
```
### Comments Counter

You may optionally put a "# of comments" counter anywhere on the page with the following code:

```
<span id="nodebb-comments-count"></span> Comments
```

A mechanism to query the number of comments on another separate page will be available in a future release.

### Author and Category information

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a1dd030bdea1cbba98e0930ea086243207f7247059b5d85dc80b7d5d2b6f9491/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4e794c73344c512e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a1dd030bdea1cbba98e0930ea086243207f7247059b5d85dc80b7d5d2b6f9491/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4e794c73344c512e706e67)

To use NodeBB's category and author information (instead of using Ghost's user/tag system), there are two elements that this plugin searches for:

```
Published by <span id="nodebb-comments-author"></span> in <span id="nodebb-comments-category"></span>
```
### Publishing

Head over to the article that you'd like to publish. The code will detect if you're both an administrator of your blog and NodeBB (so ensure that you're logged into both) and will display a publish button if so.

You may also create a `publishers` group in NodeBB to allow a group of regular users to have publish rights.

### Multiple blogs

You may use a comma-separated entry of blogs in the ACP to support publishing from a network of separate blogs to your forum. You can also choose to put each blog in its own dedicated category, or place them all into one category.

## Sites using this plugin

* [NodeBB's Blog](http://blog.nodebb.org) (Wordpress).
* [The Unknown Artist Hour](http://theunknownartisthour.com) (Ghost).

[![ANONYMOUSKOREAN](/assets/uploads/profile/uid-29247/29247-profileavatar-1736119204372.jpeg "ANONYMOUSKOREAN")A](/user/anonymouskorean)

I posted this same thread on another forum and wanted a different audience for the same questions.
I'm starting a new site to merge existing communities into with some friends, this was originally going to be built from the ground up but now we're looking at existing forum solutions. One of the main reasons we're considering a pre-built solution is the ease of dealing with bugs, maintenance, and scalability. With a tried-and-tested framework, we can focus more on building features and expanding functionality rather than reinventing the wheel and troubleshooting core issues.
What we're looking for:
Modern, responsive framework
Easy moderation tools to help manage content and enforce community standards without hassle. Preferably user-owned groups as well.
Plugin and extension support (e.g., for a custom film database) to expand functionality without heavy backend development.
Open-source or self-hosted options
Highly customizable UI, as we plan to allow users to customize profiles in a similar fashion to myspace as opposed to the current offerings.
We're leaning toward NodeBB right now due to its framework and plugin ecosystem, but we're open to hearing feedback about why XF or IPS might be worth considering instead or something entirely different that we haven't heard of. When it comes to choosing a solution money really isn't the problem we just really want something that's not going to force us in one specific direction.

What would be involved in changing the domain name of the forums?
I've had to do this many times in the past and most times, it's been an absolute nightmare.
Nodebb seems so well designed that I'm hoping it's a relatively simple task.

Hi everyone,
i am currently in the move from a traditional forum to NodeBB. But i've realized there is no working plugin any longer which shows images in postings in a lightbox or fancybox instead opening a new browser tab.
The existing plugins aren't working any longer with the latest versions of nodeBB.
Any chances to get this done? I'm not good in programming, so writing a plugin on my own might take years
Thanks

And in all seriousness, weeks ticking on:
I have been waiting with bated breath since Jan 1st for v4 to become main branch. With Julian saying a couple of weeks ago "it would be soon", and "v3.12.1 was last and would be locked for new features." Since there's been v3.12.2 ...

Hello everyone,
for testing purposes i have installed NodeBB successfully on a Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server.
So far everything is working, except the search.
Whenever someone is searching for content which is definitively posted in my instance, the search returns no results.
I've tried it with the DB search plugin and alternatively with solr running in parallel on that machine.
But independent from what is in use, the search returns nothing.
It's also not language dependend, i've tried it with german and english as well.
Any ideas how to get this running?
NodeBB is really a modern discussion plattform i would like to use, but a not working search is a showstopper.
Thanks
Uwe

Backblaze B2 Storage Plugin
Heya guys. I have for my own forum put together a plugin for utilising Backblaze due to issues I was having with the S3 upload plugin on the 3.x version of nodeb. I have probably made mistakes and such as it's my first proper plugin and but it does work!
There might be issues or oversights with it that I have yet to encounter, so I cannot say that I would recommend using it, but it's here if anyone is interested or has feedback.
NPM Package: Link
Thanks again for you guys, NodeBB is great.

Hi Guys,
I've recently installed NodeBB instance and would like to understand a few things I've seen here on the official NodeBB:
There are links with icons on the top right corner of this website's homepage or categories page, I would like to implement that on my instance as well and was wondering if that some sort of plugin or just bare code added in the settings?
I would like to use Facebook and Google auth and need some help settings that, maybe something i miss on the facebook end of things.
If anyone reading this have a spare minute to help out via discord it would mean a great deal to me, and much appreciated.
Thanks regardless, have a blessed day

  @codenamejessica said in Xenforo vs NodeBB vs Invision in 2025 (and Beyond):
  At the end of the day, it comes down to finding the right tool for the job. NodeBB is a fantastic project with a bright future, but Invision was a better fit for what I needed right now
  Similar to me. On my Astronomy/Astrophotography site I needed more than what NodeBB could offer. Link Directory, Reviews, Classifieds, Articles, Resource Manager and more.
  But I am really impressed by NodeBB for those that are primarily looking for what many call a "forum only" offering.

  @baris Thank you, yeah I already did that, fork will make the modification once I move the main site's header over and put it in its breadcrumb area. Anyways, I really appreciate how quickly you respond, and will continue to do my addons over time.

  They are not generated live. If we only apply it to new slugs then you will have tons of slugs in the old format. Not sure if that will lead to other issues.
