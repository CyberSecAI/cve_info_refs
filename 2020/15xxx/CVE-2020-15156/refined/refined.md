Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15156

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) validation in the `nodebb-plugin-blog-comments` plugin for NodeBB. Specifically, the `/comments/reply` and `/comments/publish` endpoints were missing CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin did not properly validate the origin of requests to the `/comments/reply` and `/comments/publish` endpoints, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **XSS Potential:**  While the primary vulnerability is CSRF, the impact is stated as allowing a third party to "post on their behalf on the forum", which implies that an attacker could use a crafted CSRF request to inject malicious content, potentially leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could potentially perform actions such as posting comments or publishing articles on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.
- **XSS Injection:** Through crafted requests, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the comments section, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users, leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF:** An attacker would craft a malicious HTML page or script that, when loaded by a logged-in user, sends a forged request to the vulnerable endpoints of the NodeBB forum.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers might use social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing) to trick users into visiting the malicious page or clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoints `/comments/reply` and `/comments/publish`.
- **Ability to Forge Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to create a forged HTTP request that mimics a legitimate request to the vulnerable endpoints, and to trick a logged-in user's browser into sending it.
- **No Direct Access to the Server Needed:** The attacker does not need direct access to the NodeBB server; they exploit the vulnerability through the victim's browser.
- **Victim Must Be Logged In:** The attack relies on the victim being logged into their NodeBB forum account during the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `0.7.0` of the `nodebb-plugin-blog-comments` plugin.
- The fix involved adding CSRF validation using the `middleware.applyCSRF` middleware.
- A workaround was suggested which involved cherry-picking the commit `cf43bee`
- The vulnerability is considered to be of "moderate" severity.
