# Asset directory traversal with some storage modules

High

[NGPixel](/NGPixel)
published
GHSA-whpv-5xg2-w527
Oct 3, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>=2.5.80 <2.5.151

## Patched versions

2.5.151

## Description

### Impact

Directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal.

This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs.

### Patches

Commit [084dcd6](https://github.com/requarks/wiki/commit/084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc) fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path.

### Workarounds

Disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities:

* Local File System
* Git

---

Thanks to [@daniellivingston](https://github.com/daniellivingston) for reporting this vulnerability.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15236
