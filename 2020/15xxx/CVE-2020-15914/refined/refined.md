Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15914:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the Origin Client renders text chat messages using its web browser. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper sanitization and validation of text chat messages, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's Origin client.
- **Sensitive Data Access:** The attacker can potentially access sensitive data related to the user's Origin account, such as:
    - Chat messages
    - Friends list
    - Achievements
    - List of owned games
    - Wishlist
- **Control/Monitoring of Chat:** The attacker could control or monitor the Origin text chat window.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Chat Message:** The attacker leverages the Origin Client's text chat feature.
- **Crafted JavaScript Payload:** The attacker sends a specially crafted text chat message containing a JavaScript payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Origin Account:** The attacker needs a valid Origin account to log in.
- **Friend Relationship (for targeted attacks):**  To send a message directly, the attacker must be on the target user's friends list, or convince the user to accept a friend request.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft the malicious payload.
- **Timing/User Interaction:** The payload will execute when the Origin client starts. If the target user is already running the Origin client, the attacker needs to wait for the user to restart the client, or convince the user to do so.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Origin for Mac & PC version 10.5.86 and earlier.
- The issue was resolved in version 10.5.87 with client-side and server-side content sanitization and validation.
- There were no known attacks exploiting this vulnerability at the time of disclosure.
- The CVSS score is 8.2, indicating a high severity.
