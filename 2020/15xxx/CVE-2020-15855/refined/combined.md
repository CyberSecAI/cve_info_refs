## 5.7.1

8 Nov 2021`

This is a bugfix release.

 Server upgrade instructions

This release contains database migrations. To apply them, run:

 $ sudo -u apache /usr/bin/alembic -c /etc/bodhi/alembic.ini upgrade head

Summary of the migrations:

- Add End of life (eol) field to the releases (`4241`).

 Backwards incompatible changes

- Query on both relevant Greenwave decision contexts for critical-path updates. `Update.get\_test\_gating\_info()` now returns a list of decision dictionaries, not a single decision dictionary. The API endpoint `/updates/{id}/get-test-results` similarly now returns a single-key dictionary whose value is a list of decisions, not a single decision dictionary. (4259).

 Features

- Added support for release names ending with "N" such as EPEL next (4222).
- Set a `delta` parameter of 30 days when quering datagrepper for bodhi-related user activity (4255).
- Added support for setting flags in generated advisories to require logging out and logging back in for the update to take effect (4213).
- Replace Greenwave decision change message consumer with ResultsDB and WaiverDB message consumers (4230).

 Bug fixes

- Fix an issue that caused the builds in a side-tag update to not be
tagged correctly when the build list of the update was modified (4161).
- Bodhi will now delete the side-tag in Koji when an update is pushed to stable. Builds that were tagged in the side-tag but were not pushed as part of the update will be untagged. This is required to make sure to not leave stale side-tags in the Koji database (4228).
- Updates for archived releases cannot be edited anymore (4236).
- Correctly mark automatic updates as critpath when appropriate (4177).
- Fixed an issue with validators that prevents inconsistent refusal of bodhi override with maximum duration (4182).
- Fixed an issue where the search result box was cutted off out of screen borders (4206).
- Fixed a javascript bug which prevented the "waive tests" button to be displayed in UI (4208).
- Fixed an issue with validators that prevented a side-tag update owner to edit their update after adding a build for which they don't have commit access (4209).
- Avoid gating status ping-pong on update creation, assume status 'waiting' for 2 hours or until first failed test (4221).
- For new packages submitted to repositories, the changelog was not generated and attached to the automatic Update. This prevented the bugs mentioned in the changelog to be closed by Bodhi (4232).
- Staging Bodhi now uses staging Bugzilla URL for bug links (4238).
- Fixed an issue where editing Updates always caused to set the request to Testing (4263).

 Development improvements

- Add End of life (eol) field to the releases (:

## 5.7.0

===
This is a feature release.

Features
=======

\* Query different Greenwave contexts for critical path updates, allowing for
 stricter policies to apply (:pr:`4180`).
\* Use Pagure's `hascommit` new endpoint API to check user's rights to
 create/edit updates. This allow collaborators to push updates for releases
 for which they have commit access. (:pr:`4181`).

Bug fixes
=======

\* Fixed an error about handling bugs in automatic updates (:pr:`4170`).
\* Side-tag wheren't emptied when updates for current releases were pushed to
 stable (:pr:`4173`).
\* Bodhi will avoid sending both 'update can now be pushed' and 'update has been
 pushed' notifications at the same time on updates pushed automatically
 (:issue:`3846`).
\* Clear request status when release goes EOL (:issue:`4039`).
\* Allow bodhi to not operate automatically on bugs linked to in changelog for
 specific releases (:issue:`4094`).
\* Use the release git branch name to query PDC for critpath components
 (:issue:`4177`).
\* Avoid using datetime.utcnow() for updateinfo <updated\_date> and <issued\_date>
 elements, use "date\_submitted" instead. (:issue:`4189`).
\* Updates which already had a comment that they can be pushed to stable were
 not automatically pushed to stable when the `stable\_days` threshold was
 reached (:issue:`4042`).
