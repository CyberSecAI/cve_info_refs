### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v10.9.0-a2...v10.9.0-b1`

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Enable certificate verification in PKIConnection

[Browse files](/dogtagpki/pki/tree/50c23ec146ee9abf28c9de87a5f7787d495f0b72)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
To PKIConnection's initialization handler, we introduce a new argument,
cert_paths, which takes a string or iterable; each unit of which is
treated as a capath or cafile depending on whether or not it is a
directory. See ssl.SSLContext.load_verify_locations for more
information. This enables both PKI and IPA to specify independent CA
file locations at the same time and have fallback if this does not work.

Because some users might've already loaded the CA certificate into the
system-wide CA certificate store (if they're running Dogtag in
production), we also inclue the global trust store.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1855273#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2020-07-09 12:27:02 UTC  ``` Dogtag's pki.client.PKIConnection class disables python-requests certificate validation. The argument `verify=False` means that no certificate validation is performed at all [2]. The client accepts any certificate. Since the verify parameter is hard-coded in all request functions, it is not possible to override the setting.  PKIConnection should use requests default settings (verify with default certs) and offer an API to override default CA certs or disable requests.  [2] <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1855273#c1)  Cedric Buissart    2020-07-09 12:27:08 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Christian Heimes   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1855273#c2)  Cedric Buissart    2020-07-10 17:13:58 UTC  ``` Created pki-core tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1855854](show_bug.cgi?id=1855854 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-15720 pki-core: pki: dogtag's Python client does not validate certificate [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1855273#c3)  Cedric Buissart    2020-07-10 17:14:40 UTC  ``` Upstream fix : <https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/50c23ec146ee9abf28c9de87a5f7787d495f0b72>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1855273#c6)  Cedric Buissart    2020-10-15 07:38:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  In PKI, the pki.client.PKIConnection python class is used by the `pki-server` and `pkispawn` commands. `pki-server` runs locally on the server, thus not subject to a Person in the Middle attack. `pkispawn` may access remote node in decentralized or cloned contexts.  Identity Management (IPA) command line interface (the vault related sub-commands) may call pki.client.PKIConnection().   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1855273#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-04 02:26:19 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
