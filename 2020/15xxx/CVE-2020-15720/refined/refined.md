Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15720:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `pki.client.PKIConnection` class in Dogtag's Python client was disabling TLS/SSL certificate validation by default. This was done by setting `verify=False` in the `requests.Session` object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Disabled Certificate Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper certificate validation. The client was configured to accept any certificate presented by the server, regardless of its validity or authenticity.
- **Hardcoded `verify=False`:**  The `verify` parameter was hardcoded in the `PKIConnection` class, making it impossible for users to enable certificate verification without modifying the code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker could intercept the communication between a client and a Dogtag server by performing a MitM attack.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The attacker could eavesdrop on the communication, potentially gaining access to sensitive information being transmitted.
- **Integrity Compromise:** The attacker could modify the communication, potentially causing the client or server to behave in unexpected ways.
- **Active MitM:** The bug description specifically notes that the MitM attack could be active, meaning the attacker could not only passively observe but also manipulate the communication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker would need to position themselves on the network path between the client and the server.
- **Malicious Server:** An attacker could set up a malicious server that presents a forged or invalid certificate.
- **DNS Spoofing:** An attacker could redirect traffic to a malicious server via DNS spoofing techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the communication path between the client and the Dogtag server.
- **Ability to Intercept Traffic:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.
- **Knowledge of the Target System:**  The attacker would need a basic understanding of the PKI system and where the client makes its connections to the PKI server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability existed because the `verify` parameter was hard-coded to `False`, preventing users from enabling verification.
- The fix involved introducing a `cert_paths` parameter to the `PKIConnection` class, enabling users to specify trusted CA certificates and/or directories, and also enabling certificate validation by default (`verify=True`).
-  The fix also loads system-wide CA certificates by default if they are available to be loaded
- The vulnerability affected the `pki-server` (local only) and `pkispawn` commands, as well as Identity Management (IPA) command line interface (the vault related sub-commands).
- The upstream fix is available at [https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/50c23ec146ee9abf28c9de87a5f7787d495f0b72](https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/50c23ec146ee9abf28c9de87a5f7787d495f0b72)
