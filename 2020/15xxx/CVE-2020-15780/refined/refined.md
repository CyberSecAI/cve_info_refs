Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-15780:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on loading ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) tables through configfs in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the ACPI implementation in the kernel does not prevent a privileged attacker from loading arbitrary ACPI tables through configfs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation**: The kernel does not properly validate or sanitize the input ACPI tables that are loaded via configfs.
- **Insufficient Access Control**: The ACPI implementation lacks the necessary access controls to prevent privileged users from loading arbitrary, potentially malicious ACPI tables.
- **Secure Boot Bypass**: A vulnerability exists which allows a privileged attacker to bypass Secure Boot restrictions by loading malicious ACPI tables.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Secure Boot Lockdown Bypass**: Successful exploitation allows a privileged attacker to bypass Secure Boot lockdown restrictions.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: This vulnerability enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access**: A local privileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Configfs**: The attacker uses configfs to load malicious ACPI tables.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Privileged Access**: The attacker must have administrative or root-level privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Local access to the system**: The attacker must be able to access the system locally and interact with the configfs file system.

**Additional details based on the documents provided (beyond the CVE description):**

- The exploit involves loading specially crafted ACPI tables, particularly SSDT (Secondary System Description Table) code.
- Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution within the kernel, potentially enabling privilege escalation.
- The vulnerability bypasses Secure Boot lockdown restrictions.
- A patch for this vulnerability disables modification of ACPI tables when the kernel is locked down.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score ranging from 5.5 to 7.8 by different sources, with SUSE rating the CVSS base score as 7.3.
- The vulnerability affects various SUSE Linux Enterprise products as well as openSUSE Leap.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jason A. Donenfeld.
