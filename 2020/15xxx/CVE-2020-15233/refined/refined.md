Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15233:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insufficient validation of redirect URLs in the OAuth2 flow, specifically concerning loopback addresses. The system failed to properly check if the query string of a redirect URI matched the registered URI, and also didn't validate the host parameter correctly if it was a loopback address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Query Parameter Bypass:** The system did not strictly compare the query parameters of the requested redirect URI with the registered redirect URI. This allowed an attacker to append arbitrary query parameters to a registered redirect URI and still have it be considered valid.
2.  **Loopback Host Mismatch:** The system did not correctly validate the hostname/host parameter when loopback addresses were used in the redirect URI. This allowed an attacker to register a redirect URI with one hostname and then successfully use a different loopback address during an OAuth2 flow.
3.  **Case Normalization:** The system used `strings.ToLower` normalization when comparing redirect URIs. This allowed an attacker to register a redirect URI with one case and then successfully use a different case during an OAuth2 flow. This was fixed by comparing the strings directly without converting to lower case.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially craft a malicious redirect URL that, while appearing legitimate due to the lax validation, could redirect the user to a site under the attacker's control.
*   This could lead to the user unknowingly sending their OAuth2 authorization code or access token to the attacker.
*   This would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to register a client application with a specific redirect URI.
*   During the OAuth2 flow, the attacker would then request an authorization using a manipulated redirect URI that bypasses the validation.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the loopback interface on the machine where the user is performing the OAuth2 flow (e.g., localhost, 127.0.0.1, [::1]).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to register a client application with a redirect URI.
*   The attacker needs to control the loopback interface on the user's machine.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into initiating an OAuth2 flow with the manipulated redirect URI.
* The attacker would need to make the user perform the OAuth flow through their malicious application or crafted request.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability was introduced with the fix for issue #400.
* The vulnerability is specific to loopback addresses
* The vulnerability was fixed in version v0.34.1 by implementing strict redirect URL matching which includes the query parameters and proper host validation on loopback addresses.
* The commit cdee51e fixes the issue

**CVSS Vector String Breakdown**
*   **AV:N (Network):** The attack can be launched remotely.
*   **AC:L (Low):** The attack requires no special access conditions.
*   **PR:H (High):** The attacker needs high privileges (registering a malicious OAuth client).
*   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction (e.g., clicking on a malicious link) is required.
*   **S:U (Unchanged):**  The vulnerability affects a single component.
*   **C:H (High):** High impact on confidentiality.
*   **I:H (High):** High impact on integrity.
*   **A:N (None):** No impact on availability.
*   **E:P (Proof-of-Concept):** A proof of concept exploit exists.
*   **RL:O (Official Fix):** Official fix is available
*   **RC:C (Confirmed):** The exploitability of the vulnerability is confirmed
