## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix: make redirect URL checking more strict

[Browse files](/ory/fosite/tree/cdee51ebe721bfc8acca0fd0b86b030ca70867bf)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
The OAuth 2.0 Client's Redirect URL and the Redirect URL used in the OAuth 2.0 flow do not check if the query string is equal:

1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `[https://example.com/callback`](https://example.com/callback%60)
2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `<https://example.com/callback?bar=foo`>
3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `<https://example.com/callback?bar=foo`> with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.

Additionally, matching Redirect URLs used `strings.ToLower` normalization:

1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `[https://example.com/callback`](https://example.com/callback%60)
2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `[https://example.com/CALLBACK`](https://example.com/CALLBACK%60)
3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `<https://example.com/CALLBACK> ` with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.

This patch addresses all of these issues and adds regression tests to keep the implementation secure in future releases.

# OAuth2 Redirect URL validity does not respect query parameters and host for loopback addresses

Moderate

[aeneasr](/aeneasr)
published
GHSA-rfq3-w54c-f9q5
Oct 2, 2020

## Package

github.com/ory/fosite
(Go Modules)

## Affected versions

v0.30.3 - v0.34.0

## Patched versions

v0.34.1

## Description

### Impact

[fosite#400](https://github.com/ory/fosite/pull/400) (released as v0.30.2) introduced a new feature for handling redirect URLs pointing to loopback interfaces ([rfc8252#section-7.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252#section-7.3)). As part of that change new behavior was introduced which failed to respect the redirect URL's (only for loopback interfaces!) query parameters

1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `http://127.0.0.1/callback`
2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `http://127.0.0.1/callback?bar=foo`
3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `http://127.0.0.1/callback?bar=foo` with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.

as well as the host parameter (as long as the host is a loopback interface):

1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `https://example.com/callback`
2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `http://127.0.0.1/callback`
3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `http://127.0.0.1/callback` with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.

These bugs are only applicable in scenarios where the attacker has control over the loopback interface (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) where the browser performing the OAuth2 flow is running.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched with **ORY Fosite v0.34.1**.

### Workarounds

None.

### Vector string

`CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C` rated **6.1 severity**

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-15233

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
