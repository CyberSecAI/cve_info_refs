Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-15111

**Description:** The vulnerability exists in the `c.Attachment()` function of the gofiber/fiber library. The filename provided to this function is not properly escaped, making it susceptible to CRLF injection attacks.

**Root Cause:**
- The `c.Attachment()` function in versions prior to 1.12.6 did not escape the filename parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CRLF Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of the filename, allowing injection of Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters. This enables an attacker to manipulate HTTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Header Manipulation:** An attacker can inject CRLF sequences into the filename, causing the server to interpret subsequent lines as new headers.
- **File Download Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially alter the downloaded file's name, inject arbitrary content into the HTTP response or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Session Fixation:** The attacker can inject an `Authorization` header to perform a session fixation attack.
- **Escalated Attacks:** A CRLF injection can be used as a stepping stone to other attacks like XSS, web cache poisoning, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker provides a crafted filename containing CRLF characters through the `c.Attachment()` function.
- The application uses this unsanitized filename in the `Content-Disposition` header

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control or influence the filename parameter that is passed to the `c.Attachment()` function.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is patched in version 1.12.6 by URL-encoding the filename passed to `c.Attachment()`.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided example code demonstrates how an attacker can inject a malicious filename, adding `Location` and `Authorization` headers.
