The provided content is related to CVE-2020-15342.

**Summary:** The Zyxel CNM SecuManager software contains multiple vulnerabilities, including several backdoor APIs accessible without authentication. Specifically, the `/zy_get_user_id_and_key` API allows an attacker to retrieve the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` used for cloud communication.

**Root Cause:**
- The software includes undocumented APIs that lack authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Backdoor APIs:** Multiple APIs are accessible without authentication.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `/zy_get_user_id_and_key` API leaks sensitive cloud credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` used for communication with the cloud. This would allow an attacker to impersonate the device and potentially gain access to the cloud management functionality for the device and its associated network.
- The compromised cloud keys can be used to further attack the device and associated networks by modifying the deviceâ€™s configuration or deploying malicious commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server, likely on the WAN interface.
