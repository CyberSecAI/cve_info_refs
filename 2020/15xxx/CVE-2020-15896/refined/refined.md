{
  "CVE-2020-15896": {
    "Description": "Authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Dâ€™link DAP 1522 access point, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the web interface.",
    "Root cause": "The web interface checks for the presence of a 'NO_NEED_AUTH' parameter. If this parameter is set to '1', authentication is bypassed, allowing direct access to protected pages. This logic was intended for specific pages like 'logout.php' or 'login.php' but it was not limited to just those pages.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel (CWE-288)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the web interface of the D-Link DAP-1522 access point, potentially gaining full control of the device, and affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system (VIA triad).",
    "Attack vectors": "By appending the query string `NO_NEED_AUTH=1` to any protected URL, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the network and able to access the router's login page."
