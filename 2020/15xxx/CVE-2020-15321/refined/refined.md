```
Root cause of vulnerability:
  - The MySQL database is pre-configured with several static accounts and hardcoded credentials.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
  - Hardcoded credentials for multiple MySQL accounts, including 'root' and 'livedbuser'.
  - The `debian-sys-maint` system account has a hardcoded password.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Unauthorized access to the MySQL database.
  - Ability to view, modify, or delete data within the database.
  - Potential for further compromise of the system by leveraging database access.

Attack vectors:
  - Network access to the MySQL service (although it only listens on the loopback interface, access can still be gained from within the device or through other vulnerabilities).
  - Exploiting the hardcoded credentials directly.
  - Using the provided credentials to access other applications or scripts that rely on the MySQL database, as demonstrated with the collectd plugin and Axess TR-069 solutions.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to connect to the MySQL database from within the device or through other compromised services or interfaces.
  - Knowledge of the hardcoded credentials.
  - Ability to execute SQL queries against the database.
