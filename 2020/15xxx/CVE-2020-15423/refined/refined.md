- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of the `dominio` parameter within `ajax_mod_security.php` before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection vulnerability. The lack of proper input validation allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is reachable remotely and does not require authentication. An attacker can send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint (`ajax_mod_security.php`) with a malicious payload in the `dominio` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable service (CentOS Web Panel) over the network and does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
