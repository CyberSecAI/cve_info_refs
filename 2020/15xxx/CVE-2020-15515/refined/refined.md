Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the failure to sanitize user input within the "Turn!" (turn) TYPO3 extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This means complete system compromise, potentially leading to data theft, denial of service, or further attacks on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when user input is not sanitized.
- The attack requires the attacker to have FTP/SFTP access to the TYPO3 website to upload the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **FTP/SFTP Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials for FTP or SFTP access to the TYPO3 server to be able to exploit this vulnerability.
-  **Backend Access:** The attacker needs to be able to use the TYPO3 backend, meaning a valid user account with access privileges

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable component is a third-party TYPO3 extension named "Turn!" (turn). This is not part of the default TYPO3 installation, so only websites using this specific extension are vulnerable.
