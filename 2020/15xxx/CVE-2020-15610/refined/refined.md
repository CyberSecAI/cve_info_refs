- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of a user-supplied string in the `modulo` parameter within `ajax_php_pecl.php` before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection. The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of root. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, denial of service, and further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `ajax_php_pecl.php` script. Attackers can remotely send a malicious request containing a crafted `modulo` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
