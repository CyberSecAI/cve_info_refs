Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an insecure default configuration of the JMX (Java Management Extensions) service within VMware GemFire and VMware Tanzu GemFire for VMs.
- Specifically, the JMX service is exposed without a SecurityManager enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The JMX service is configured with insecure defaults, making it vulnerable to exploitation.
- **Lack of SecurityManager:** The absence of a SecurityManager allows for the creation of malicious MBeans.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The creation of a malicious MLet MBean allows for arbitrary remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the exposed JMX service.
- An attacker can leverage the insecure configuration to create a malicious MLet MBean, which then executes arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the exposed JMX service.
- The attacker needs to be able to create an MLet mbean.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

- VMware GemFire versions prior to 9.10.0, 9.9.2, 9.8.7, and 9.7.6
- VMware Tanzu GemFire for VMs versions prior to 1.11.1 and 1.10.2
