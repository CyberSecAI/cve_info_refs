{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Tendermint did not limit the number of P2P connection requests, and did not reclaim `activeID` of a peer after its removal in the `Mempool` reactor.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Uncontrolled resource consumption due to unlimited P2P connection requests.",
    "Memory leak due to failure to reclaim `activeID` of a peer.",
    "Lack of rate limiting for P2P connection requests per IP.",
    "Lack of rate limiting for HTTP(S) requests."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting the node's memory resources, leading to out-of-memory (OOM) exceptions and node panics.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a large number of P2P connection requests to the target node.",
    "Exploiting the memory leak in the `Mempool` reactor by repeatedly establishing and tearing down connections."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the target node. No other specific capabilities or privileged access are needed."
