Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-5742:

**Root Cause:**
- The Plex Media Server had a weak Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. The server's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header was set to '\*', allowing requests from any origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Weak CORS Policy:** The overly permissive CORS policy allowed any website to make requests to the Plex Media Server.
- **Lack of Origin Validation:** The server did not validate the origin of incoming requests, making it vulnerable to cross-site attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stealing `X-Plex-Token`:** An attacker could steal a user's `X-Plex-Token` which authenticates their access to the server.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker could access private media, change server settings, reboot the media server, and perform other unauthorized actions.
- **Arbitrary API Access**: The attacker could make any API call that the user could make.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Phishing Attack:** An attacker would trick a victim into logging into a malicious Plex Media Server under the attacker's control.
- **Malicious Website/Server:** The attacker's server would host client-side code that exploits the weak CORS policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious Plex Media Server.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a victim user, who has admin access to a legitimate Plex Media Server, into logging into the malicious server.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability directly, only the ability to have the victim's browser make requests to the attacker controlled server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was mitigated on June 15, 2020, by Plex on authentication pages server-side, which now notifies users if they are logging into an application not hosted by Plex.
*   The Tenable advisory provides a detailed timeline of the vulnerability disclosure and mitigation process.
* The CVSS v3 score is 8.8 (High), while the CVSS v2 score is 6.8 (Medium).
