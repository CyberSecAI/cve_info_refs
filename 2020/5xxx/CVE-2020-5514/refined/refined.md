{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not validate the file type or content of the 'src' parameter in the '/gilacms/lzld/thumb' endpoint when creating image thumbnails. The application uses the PHP 'copy' function to download and save the file, without checking the file extension. This allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious file as the src parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution due to lack of file type and content validation",
      "Unrestricted file upload and download",
       "Insecure usage of PHP's copy function"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is through the '/gilacms/lzld/thumb' endpoint.",
      "The attacker provides the URL of a remotely hosted malicious file (e.g., a .phar or .phtml file with PHP code) via the 'src' parameter.",
      "The malicious file is downloaded and stored in the /tmp/ directory and executed when accessed through the browser"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to be authenticated as admin to access the vulnerable endpoint.",
      "The attacker must have the ability to host a malicious file on a remote server.",
       "The web server configuration should support other extensions such as .phar, .phtml in order for this to be exploited."
