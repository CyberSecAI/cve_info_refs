Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-5281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when constructing LDAP queries. Specifically, the `searchString` and `login` parameters were directly incorporated into the LDAP query without escaping special characters that hold significance in LDAP syntax.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **LDAP Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to LDAP injection. Malicious users could inject arbitrary LDAP syntax into the `searchString` or `login` parameters, potentially altering the intended query to extract more information than permitted or even perform unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could modify the LDAP query to retrieve data they would not normally be authorized to access. This might include sensitive information stored in the LDAP directory.
- **Configuration Modification:** The advisory mentions that a VO or group manager can modify the configuration of the LDAP extSource to retrieve all information from the Perun LDAP, implying that they could potentially alter how the LDAP interacts with Perun.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the `searchString` or `login` parameters that are used to construct LDAP queries. These parameters are likely exposed through a web interface or an API that allows VO or group managers to manage configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **VO or Group Manager Role:** The attacker needs to be a VO or group manager or to be able to impersonate one, indicating they need to have some level of privileged access within the system. This is because they have the ability to modify the LDAP extSource configuration, which is how the vulnerability is exploited.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `ExtSourceLdap.java` file, specifically in the `findSubjectsLogins` and `getSubjectByLogin` methods. The `query` string, which is used to construct the LDAP query, is vulnerable to injection because it is not escaped correctly.
- The fix involves the introduction of a new method `Utils.escapeStringForLDAP` in `Utils.java`, which escapes the following characters: `\`, `*`, `(`, `)`, and `\000`. This method is then used in `ExtSourceLdap.java` to sanitize user-provided input before inclusion in the LDAP query.
- The vulnerable code was replacing all occurrences of `?` with searchString via `query.replaceAll("\\?", searchString);` followed by a second replace with no escaping. This was changed to first replace all occurrences of `?` with login, and then performing an escape on the login string.
- The fix utilized `.replace()` instead of `.replaceAll()` due to the fact that `\` and `$` could have different meanings in `replaceAll`

**Patched Version:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.9.1 of the Perun software.

**Workaround:**
- The advisory indicates that there is no workaround for this vulnerability, underscoring the importance of updating to the patched version.
