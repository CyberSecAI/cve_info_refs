Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-5778:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper validation of user-supplied data when processing a type 8 message in `ttmd.exe`. Specifically, a 2-byte field indicates the number of name-value pairs in the message, and a large value in this field causes the vulnerable code to access data beyond the message boundary.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Out-of-bounds read due to insufficient validation of the name-value pair count, leading to a memory access violation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Termination of the `ttmd.exe` process, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted type 8 message to the default TCP RequestPort 10200.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need to be able to send network traffic to the affected service.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `ttmd.exe` version 7.1.28.3.
- The crafted message includes a large value (e.g., 0xffff) in the field that specifies how many name-value pairs the message contains. This leads to the program attempting to read beyond the allocated message buffer.
- The provided crash analysis shows the exact point of the access violation (`mov dl,byte ptr [eax]`) and stack trace.
