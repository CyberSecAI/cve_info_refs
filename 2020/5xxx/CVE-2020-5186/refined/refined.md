      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to stealing of authentication cookies (although HttpOnly is set by default), bypassing CSRF protections to upload 'aspx' files (backdoors), or other damaging actions against other or high-privileged users.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading a malicious XML file through the journal tools in a user's profile."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a normal user with the ability to upload XML files through journal tools."
