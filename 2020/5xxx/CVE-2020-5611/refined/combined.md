It is so hard to find a simple social sharing plugin that allows customization. All we needed was a plugin to provide social sharing buttons that float, and allows us to customize colors. Nearly everything that provides the main social networks and customization is expensive, or a pain to manage. This one is perfect! Easy, straightforward, and does exactly what we needed. Great!

By far the cleanest, most user friendly social share plugin I have used.
The free version is packed with features to add social share button to your site + customize the style the placement.
I’ve tried many social share plugins, and Social Rocket is the one I’m going to recommend from now on.
Kudos!
