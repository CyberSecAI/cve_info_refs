Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly verify SSL server certificates in the "Easy netprint App for Android".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The application does not correctly validate the SSL certificates of the servers it connects to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept and eavesdrop on encrypted communication between the app and the server.
*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially view or modify the data being transmitted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack occurs over a network connection.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker needs to be positioned between the app and the legitimate server, typically by controlling a malicious wireless access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Positioning:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable application and the server, often by setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker does not need user interaction to perform the attack.

**Summary**
The Fuji Xerox "Easy netprint App for Android" versions 2.0.3 and earlier, fails to properly validate SSL server certificates. This allows a network-positioned attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept/modify communication between the app and the server.
