Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure SSHD configuration in Dell EMC Isilon OneFS versions 8.2.2 and earlier. Specifically, the SSHD process incorrectly allows TCP and stream forwarding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The SSHD configuration allows forwarding of TCP and stream sockets.
*   **Unintended Access:** The vulnerability provides the `remotesupport` user and other users with restricted shells more access than intended, which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability has a medium severity (CVSS base score 4.3).
*   Exploitation can lead to a low level of confidentiality impact. While integrity and availability are not impacted directly, the unauthorized access could facilitate further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to have access to a restricted user account (like `remotesupport`) or have successfully compromised an account with a restricted shell.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Isilon OneFS system.
*   The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a user with a restricted shell (typically `remotesupport` by default).

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability arises because of the SSHD process allowing TCP and stream forwarding by default for restricted users in OneFS versions 8.2.2 and earlier. This can be mitigated by disabling forwarding of UNIX domain and TCP sockets, or disabling those users. It also provides specific steps to remediate the issue. This includes disabling the `remotesupport` user, or modifying the ssh server configuration to disable forwarding of UNIX domain and TCP sockets for all users or just restricted users. It should be noted that the workarounds vary depending on the OneFS version.
