{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper access control for legacy controllers and API endpoints in PrestaShop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control checks",
      "Lack of proper authorization enforcement"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct access to legacy controllers",
       "Direct access to API endpoints"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable controllers and API endpoints. No specific authentication or authorization may be required if access controls are improperly implemented or missing."
  },
  "affected_versions": "Versions of PrestaShop prior to 1.7.6.5, specifically from 1.5.0.0 and onwards",
  "patched_versions": "1.7.6.5",
  "cwe": "CWE-284",
   "additional_notes": "The fix involved adding access checks within multiple controller files for the legacy controllers and API endpoints. For example, the commits add calls to `if (!$this->access('view'))` or similar access checks before executing sensitive actions. Additionally, the vulnerability was found in both legacy controllers as well as API endpoints which could allow attackers to potentially bypass certain access control checks."
