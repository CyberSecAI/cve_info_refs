    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple parameters leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (SQLi).",

        "HTTP POST request to /hospital/hospital/hms/doctor/search.php with the 'searchdata' parameter",
        "HTTP GET request to /hospital/hospital/hms/doctor/view-patient.php with the 'viewid' parameter",
          "HTTP POST request to /hospital/hospital/hms/doctor/add-patient.php with the 'bs' parameter",
        "HTTP POST request to /hospital/hospital/hms/doctor/add-patient.php with the 'patname' parameter",
        "HTTP POST request to /hospital/hospital/hms/admin/change-password.php with the 'cpass' parameter"
