Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue within the Buffalo AirStation WHR-G54S firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):**  The device's firmware is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. This allows an attacker to potentially access files and directories outside the intended web server root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who is logged into the device can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as setting values. This could expose the device configuration, network details, passwords, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attack vector is within the adjacent network.
*   **Local Network access**: Based on the CVSS vector, the attack is performed on the adjacent network, meaning it is not directly accessible from the internet, the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid login to the device's web interface to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Buffalo AirStation WHR-G54S firmware version 1.43 and earlier.
*   The device is no longer supported, and the vendor recommends using alternative products.
*   Workarounds such as logging off when not in use, avoiding browsing other websites while logged in and changing the default password can mitigate the risk.
