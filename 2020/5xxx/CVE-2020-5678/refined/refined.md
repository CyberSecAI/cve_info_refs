Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5678:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in processing POST requests within the GROWI application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input included in the POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79): Malicious script can be injected via POST requests and stored within the application, which can then be executed when other users access the stored data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's browser when they interact with the injected content. This can lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- POST requests: Malicious data is sent through a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low privileges: An attacker with low privileges, such as a normal authenticated user, is required to perform the attack.
- User interaction: Requires a user to interact with the stored data to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- Network access: An attacker requires network access to send the malicious POST requests.

**Additional details:**

- The affected version is GROWI v3.8.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is categorized as medium severity with CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 and v2 base score of 3.5.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to version 4.1.5 or later.
