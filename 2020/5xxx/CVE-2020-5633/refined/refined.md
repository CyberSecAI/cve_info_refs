Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5633:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass issue in the implementation of the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware when handling Remote Management Control Protocol (RMCP) connections over IPMI over LAN. Specifically, the affected products have a flaw that allows an unauthorized session to be established during RMCP access to the BMC via LAN.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper authentication: The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to the BMC.
- Insecure default configuration: IPMI over LAN is enabled by default in affected products, making them susceptible to attack out of the box.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can:
- Obtain or modify BMC settings.
- Obtain monitoring information.
- Reboot or shut down the affected product.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability is exploitable through network connections, specifically via RMCP over IPMI over LAN.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network connectivity to the target device's BMC.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication mechanisms and does not require any specific privileges.

**Affected Products:**
The following products with BMC firmware Rev1.09 and earlier are affected:
- NEC Express5800/T110j
- NEC Express5800/T110j-S
- NEC Express5800/T110j (2nd-Gen)
- NEC Express5800/T110j-S (2nd-Gen)
- NEC Express5800/GT110j
- NEC iStorage NS100Ti

**Mitigation:**
- Disable IPMI over LAN: The primary recommendation is to disable IPMI over LAN functionality to prevent exploitation.
- Firmware update: Upgrade the BMC firmware to version 1.10 or later, which addresses the vulnerability.
- Network segmentation: If IPMI over LAN is necessary, restrict access to the BMC to a secure, firewalled intranet and ensure it's not exposed to the internet.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to the implementation of RMCP over IPMI over LAN, not IPMI itself.
- IPMI 2.0 is known to have a separate vulnerability (CVE-2013-4786) regarding password hash disclosure, which should also be considered.
- The issue is present if the BMC is connected to a network through LAN.
