# CVE-2020-5407: Signature Wrapping Vulnerability with spring-security-saml2-service-provider

MEDIUM | MAY 07, 2020 | CVE-2020-5407
# Description

Spring Security versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.4 and 5.3.x prior to 5.3.2 contain a signature wrapping vulnerability during SAML response validation.

  + 5.3.x prior to 5.3.2

# Mitigation
