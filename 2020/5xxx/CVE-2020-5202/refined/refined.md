  "CVE-2020-5202": {
    "description": "apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf. This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `acngtool` program in `apt-cacher-ng` attempts to connect to the daemon via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if a different `SocketPath` is provided. This is due to a hardcoded default IP of localhost when no `BinAddr` is configured.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `acngtool` program ignores the explicit `SocketPath` argument and connects to the daemon via localhost:3142 by default.",
        "Port 3142 is an unprivileged port, allowing any local user to bind to it.",
        "The cron job `/etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng` periodically triggers the vulnerable `acngtool` command.",
         "Lack of proper peer verification by default in apt-cacher-ng"
      ],
      "impact": "An unprivileged local user can bind to port 3142 before the `apt-cacher-ng` daemon, causing `acngtool` to send requests, potentially containing sensitive data such as authentication credentials (if `AdminAuth` is enabled), to the attacker.",
      "attack_vector": "Local access is required for the attack to be successful. A local attacker can bind to the TCP port before the intended service, or when the service crashes, or when it is not started and can receive sensitive information",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to bind to a local port and the ability to execute a listener on this port. No authentication is needed other than the ability to run netcat as a normal user to listen on TCP port 3142."
