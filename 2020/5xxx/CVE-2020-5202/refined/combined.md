# CVE-2020-5202

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-4788.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-5204.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-5202 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5202)

#### Description

apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf. This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can.

# CVE-2020-5202

| **Name** | CVE-2020-5202 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf. This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can. |

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1813930#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-03-16 14:10:30 UTC  ``` apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf. This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-25 15:01:36 UTC  ``` Another finding from [bug 1150532](show_bug.cgi?id=1150532 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - AUDIT-1: apt-cacher-ng: review of cron job file(s): /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng"). The apt-cacher-ng cron job runs the `acngtool` like this by default:  ``` /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool maint -c /etc/apt-cacher-ng SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket ```  It turns out the apt-cacher-ng daemon opens a localhost socket on port 3142 by default but also a UNIX domain socket in /var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket.  Even though the SocketPath is explicitly passed to acngtool, the tool prefers the localhost communication via port 3142. This could allow a local attacker to bind to port 3142 to setup a fake apt-cacher-ng service that the acngtool will then talk to. This works when the attacker wins a race against systemd trying to start the daemon. Of if the daemon is simply not enabled at all, or crashes.  Since apt-cacher-ng also supports credentials and no peer verification is done by default, the cron job would send those credentials to the unprivileged local user. Therefore is this a serious information leak.  The bug is coming from the upstream code. I've traced it back to source/acngtool.cc:503 where the following happens:  ``` 	auto nips = Tokenize(cfg::bindaddr, SPACECHARS, hostips, true); 	if (!nips) 		hostips.emplace_back("localhost"); ```  So if no explicit BinAddr was configured in the config files then localhost is used. The SocketPath passed on the command line seems to be ignored.  I will need to report this to upstream which I will do tomorrow. Please treat this as confidential for the moment until I could offer coordinated disclosure to upstream. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 14:03:05 UTC  ``` I wrote an email to the upstream maintainer describing the problem. Let's see what he says. The following is a PoC for the weakness:  ``` root # grep AdminAuth /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf AdminAuth: mooma:moopa  root # systemctl stop apt-cacher-ng  user $ nc -l -p 3142  root # /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng  GET /acng-report.html?doExpire=Start%2bExpiration&abortOnErrors=aOe HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Debian Apt-Cacher-NG/2 Host: localhost Authorization: Basic bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE= Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache,max-age=0 Accept: application/octet-stream Accept-Encoding: identity Connection: close ```  user $ echo 'bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE=' | base64 -d mooma:moopa ``` ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-27 14:32:23 UTC  ``` The Debian maintainer responded quickly to my report. He acknowledges the issue as described in this bug. It seems they will need an embargo period, because the fix will require more than just a few lines of code. We didn't agree upon a fixed embargo period yet. I will update when I know more.  Since this is now officially an embargoed bug please don't publish any information about this issue until the security team lifts the embargo. This also includes not submitting a bugfix or description of this issue to the OBS. Thank you! ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 10:53:30 UTC  ``` I've discussed a first patch proposal with Debian upstream. There was no reply for some days now. The debian security team also didn't react yet. They will supposedly assign a DSA (Debian-Security-Advisory) and CVE on their end. When a final patch is agreed upon I will share it in this bug. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-15 13:09:20 UTC  ``` So Debian upstream somehow made an uncoordinate release of this security bugfix. Basically the CVE and the related information is already public [1]. Not everything is finished yet on Debian side but since the information is public we can publish ourselves just as well.  I will take care of this bug since no maintainer could be found so far.  Since the package is in such a bad state the proactive security team agreed to do the following:  - file a delete request for apt-cacher-ng in Factory. - submit a maintenance update for apt-cacher-ng in maintained Leap versions   that fixes the issues the best we can.  [1]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-5202> ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-20 14:20:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157706) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/765843> 15.1 / apt-cacher-ng ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-21 09:36:23 UTC  ``` I published this on oss-sec [1]. I also added the post as a public reference to the CVE via the Mitre web form, such that Mitre published the CVE in their database.  [1]: <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2020/q1/21> ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-29 11:15:07 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0124-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.

# CVE-2020-5202: apt-cacher-ng: a local unprivileged user can impersonate the apt-cacher-ng daemon, possible credentials leak

---

*From*: Matthias Gerstner <mgerstner () suse de>

*Date*: Mon, 20 Jan 2020 15:36:08 +0100

```
Hi,

apt-cacher-ng is a caching proxy for downloading packages from
Debian-style software repositories [1]. In the course of a code review
of apt-cacher-ng I noticed a possible credentials leak when
"AdminAuth" is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf.

The apt-cacher-ng daemon listens on TCP port 3142 on all network
interfaces but also creates a UNIX domain socket in
/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket. The cron job script
/etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng runs the following command:

/usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool maint -c /etc/apt-cacher-ng SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket

SocketPath is explicitly specified on the command line, trying to force
a connection to the daemon via the socket path. However, `acngtool` does
not act accordingly. Instead, when using the default configuration, it
connects to localhost:3142. This stems from the source file
source/acngtool.cc:503 (based on apt-cacher-ng 3.1 that I have looked
into), where the following is found:

```
        auto nips = Tokenize(cfg::bindaddr, SPACECHARS, hostips, true);
        if (!nips)
                hostips.emplace_back("localhost");
```

Since port 3142 is not a privileged network port, any local user may
bind to this port. Should the actual apt-cacher-ng daemon not (yet) be
running, a local unprivileged user can impersonate the daemon, and the
cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng script will sooner or later pass the AdminAuth
credentials to it. This is the proof of concept I tested on Debian 9:

```
# make sure AdminAuth is enabled
root # grep AdminAuth /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf
AdminAuth: mooma:moopa

# simulate the apt-cacher-ng daemon not running
root # systemctl stop apt-cacher-ng

# in a second shell run netcat as a regular user on port 3142
user $ nc -l -p 3142

# simulate the cron job being executed
root # /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng

# now you should see the following output in the netcat shell
GET /acng-report.html?doExpire=Start%2bExpiration&abortOnErrors=aOe HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Debian Apt-Cacher-NG/2
Host: localhost
Authorization: Basic bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE=
Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache,max-age=0
Accept: application/octet-stream
Accept-Encoding: identity
Connection: close
```

# base64 decoding the auth data, the local unprivileged user obtained
# the authentication data for apt-cacher-ng
user $ echo 'bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE=' | base64 -d
mooma:moopa
```

The issue is more severe in the openSUSE packaging where the
apt-cacher-ng daemon is not started by default, but only by explicit
Administrator configuration, which results in the attack surface being
exposed by default. But also when apt-cacher-ng crashes or can be
crashed by a local attacker, the information leak could be achieved.

Debian Upstream has already published an update with a suitable bugfix
for Debian sid [2]. I've informed the upstream author on 2019-11-26
about this issue, the Debian security team was involved, patches
reviewed and agreed upon.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-25 15:01:36 UTC  ``` Another finding from [bug 1150532](show_bug.cgi?id=1150532 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - AUDIT-1: apt-cacher-ng: review of cron job file(s): /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng"). The apt-cacher-ng cron job runs the `acngtool` like this by default:  ``` /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool maint -c /etc/apt-cacher-ng SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket ```  It turns out the apt-cacher-ng daemon opens a localhost socket on port 3142 by default but also a UNIX domain socket in /var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket.  Even though the SocketPath is explicitly passed to acngtool, the tool prefers the localhost communication via port 3142. This could allow a local attacker to bind to port 3142 to setup a fake apt-cacher-ng service that the acngtool will then talk to. This works when the attacker wins a race against systemd trying to start the daemon. Of if the daemon is simply not enabled at all, or crashes.  Since apt-cacher-ng also supports credentials and no peer verification is done by default, the cron job would send those credentials to the unprivileged local user. Therefore is this a serious information leak.  The bug is coming from the upstream code. I've traced it back to source/acngtool.cc:503 where the following happens:  ``` 	auto nips = Tokenize(cfg::bindaddr, SPACECHARS, hostips, true); 	if (!nips) 		hostips.emplace_back("localhost"); ```  So if no explicit BinAddr was configured in the config files then localhost is used. The SocketPath passed on the command line seems to be ignored.  I will need to report this to upstream which I will do tomorrow. Please treat this as confidential for the moment until I could offer coordinated disclosure to upstream. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 14:03:05 UTC  ``` I wrote an email to the upstream maintainer describing the problem. Let's see what he says. The following is a PoC for the weakness:  ``` root # grep AdminAuth /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf AdminAuth: mooma:moopa  root # systemctl stop apt-cacher-ng  user $ nc -l -p 3142  root # /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng  GET /acng-report.html?doExpire=Start%2bExpiration&abortOnErrors=aOe HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Debian Apt-Cacher-NG/2 Host: localhost Authorization: Basic bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE= Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache,max-age=0 Accept: application/octet-stream Accept-Encoding: identity Connection: close ```  user $ echo 'bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE=' | base64 -d mooma:moopa ``` ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-27 14:32:23 UTC  ``` The Debian maintainer responded quickly to my report. He acknowledges the issue as described in this bug. It seems they will need an embargo period, because the fix will require more than just a few lines of code. We didn't agree upon a fixed embargo period yet. I will update when I know more.  Since this is now officially an embargoed bug please don't publish any information about this issue until the security team lifts the embargo. This also includes not submitting a bugfix or description of this issue to the OBS. Thank you! ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 10:53:30 UTC  ``` I've discussed a first patch proposal with Debian upstream. There was no reply for some days now. The debian security team also didn't react yet. They will supposedly assign a DSA (Debian-Security-Advisory) and CVE on their end. When a final patch is agreed upon I will share it in this bug. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-15 13:09:20 UTC  ``` So Debian upstream somehow made an uncoordinate release of this security bugfix. Basically the CVE and the related information is already public [1]. Not everything is finished yet on Debian side but since the information is public we can publish ourselves just as well.  I will take care of this bug since no maintainer could be found so far.  Since the package is in such a bad state the proactive security team agreed to do the following:  - file a delete request for apt-cacher-ng in Factory. - submit a maintenance update for apt-cacher-ng in maintained Leap versions   that fixes the issues the best we can.  [1]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-5202> ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-20 14:20:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157706) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/765843> 15.1 / apt-cacher-ng ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-21 09:36:23 UTC  ``` I published this on oss-sec [1].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-25 14:51:59 UTC  ``` A serious finding from [bug 1150532](show_bug.cgi?id=1150532 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - AUDIT-1: apt-cacher-ng: review of cron job file(s): /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng"). In our package apt-cacher-ng runs as root. The /run/apt-cacher-ng directory is owned by an unprivileged user, however:  $ ls -lhd /run/apt-cacher-ng drwxr-xr-x 2 apt-cacher-ng apt-cacher-ng 80 25. Nov 15:30 /run/apt-cacher-ng/  The apt-cacher-ng daemon creates at least two files in there, a pid file and a socket file. The apt-cacher-ng unprivileged user can therefore perform symlink attacks and cause damage to the system or otherwise unspecified impact. Both files are created in a racy way by the apt-cacher-ng daemon.  The problem stems from the apt-cacher-ng.service file which is not coming from upstream but from our own packaging in OBS. On Debian they use the right approach by adding the following two directives to the file:  ``` User=apt-cacher-ng Group=apt-cacher-ng ```  This finding is worth a CVE, we will need to assign one from our own SUSE CVE pool for this since it is SUSE specific. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 10:51:24 UTC  ``` So this SUSE specific bug needs to be carefully adressed. Reducing permissions in an update is a difficile thing to do. We need to make sure that no regressions occur.  No official maintainer is left for apt-cacher-ng. We're considering to remove it from Factory, but it's still in maintained state for SLE-15 and SLE-15-SP1 backports. The question also is whether there's a customer requirement for this being in SLE, then removing it from Factory could become difficult. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2019-12-05 11:26:15 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2019-18899 to track this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-15 13:12:34 UTC  ``` Since [bug 1157706](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2020-5202: apt-cacher-ng: acngtool uses localhost connection instead of socket by default") which also affects upstream is already public we can now simply act for this bug, too. Similarly to what I wrote in the other bug, no maintainer is to be found for this package in openSUSE. Therefore the following will happen:  - a delete request will be filed for Factory - a maintenance update with emergency fixes will be submitted to maintained   Leap codestreams. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-20 14:20:10 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157703) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/765843> 15.1 / apt-cacher-ng ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c9)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-21 09:33:22 UTC  ``` I've published this on oss-sec [1].

# CVE-2020-5202

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-4788.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-5204.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-5202 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5202)

#### Description

apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf. This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can.

Subject: CVE-2020-5202: apt-cacher-ng: a local unprivileged user can
 impersonate the apt-cacher-ng daemon, possible credentials leak

Hi,

apt-cacher-ng is a caching proxy for downloading packages from
Debian-style software repositories [1]. In the course of a code review
of apt-cacher-ng I noticed a possible credentials leak when
"AdminAuth" is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf.

The apt-cacher-ng daemon listens on TCP port 3142 on all network
interfaces but also creates a UNIX domain socket in
/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket. The cron job script
/etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng runs the following command:

/usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool maint -c /etc/apt-cacher-ng SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket

SocketPath is explicitly specified on the command line, trying to force
a connection to the daemon via the socket path. However, `acngtool` does
not act accordingly. Instead, when using the default configuration, it
connects to localhost:3142. This stems from the source file
source/acngtool.cc:503 (based on apt-cacher-ng 3.1 that I have looked
into), where the following is found:

```
	auto nips = Tokenize(cfg::bindaddr, SPACECHARS, hostips, true);
	if (!nips)
		hostips.emplace_back("localhost");
```

Since port 3142 is not a privileged network port, any local user may
bind to this port. Should the actual apt-cacher-ng daemon not (yet) be
running, a local unprivileged user can impersonate the daemon, and the
cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng script will sooner or later pass the AdminAuth
credentials to it. This is the proof of concept I tested on Debian 9:

```
# make sure AdminAuth is enabled
root # grep AdminAuth /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf
AdminAuth: mooma:moopa

# simulate the apt-cacher-ng daemon not running
root # systemctl stop apt-cacher-ng

# in a second shell run netcat as a regular user on port 3142
user $ nc -l -p 3142

# simulate the cron job being executed
root # /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng

# now you should see the following output in the netcat shell
GET /acng-report.html?doExpire=Start%2bExpiration&abortOnErrors=aOe HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Debian Apt-Cacher-NG/2
Host: localhost
Authorization: Basic bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE=
Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache,max-age=0
Accept: application/octet-stream
Accept-Encoding: identity
Connection: close
```

# base64 decoding the auth data, the local unprivileged user obtained
# the authentication data for apt-cacher-ng
user $ echo 'bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE=' | base64 -d
mooma:moopa
```

The issue is more severe in the openSUSE packaging where the
apt-cacher-ng daemon is not started by default, but only by explicit
Administrator configuration, which results in the attack surface being
exposed by default. But also when apt-cacher-ng crashes or can be
crashed by a local attacker, the information leak could be achieved.

Debian Upstream has already published an update with a suitable bugfix
for Debian sid [2]. I've informed the upstream author on 2019-11-26
about this issue, the Debian security team was involved, patches
reviewed and agreed upon.

# * [AptCacherNg](/AptCacherNg)

[apt-cacher-ng](https://packages.debian.org/apt-cacher-ng "DebPkg") is a nice little software to create a local cache of the Debian mirrors (but it can also operate on other distribution mirrors). The full documentation is available on the project's [homepage](https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/) (see in particular the excellent [user manual](https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/html/index.html)).

Contents

1. [Server](#Server)
2. [Clients](#Clients)
3. [HTTPS repositories](#HTTPS_repositories)
4. [Maintenance tasks](#Maintenance_tasks)

Here are some quick instructions to get started.

## Server

```
apt install apt-cacher-ng
```

To announce the service on the network, you may also want to install [Avahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_%28software%29):

```
apt install avahi-daemon
```

**Mirror URLs with old apt-cacher-ng**

apt-cacher-ng versions before 3.7.1-1 suffer from [986356](https://bugs.debian.org/986356 "DebianBug"). Before installing apt-cacher-ng, make sure to use classic mirror server URLs such as http://ftp.us.debian.org in your /etc/apt/sources.list instead of its modern default http://deb.debian.org to avoid the bug.

## Clients

Now of course, clients need to know about this proxy. You have two options:

* automatic configuration: this will use Avahi to automatically detect proxy servers on the local network. this is useful for laptops but could be a security issue as anyone can then become a proxy for you and serve any content they wish (although [SecureApt](/SecureApt) should still ensure a proper trust chain).

```
apt install squid-deb-proxy-client
```

* automatic configuration:
  + there is also auto-apt-proxy which can automatically detects common setups by checking localhost, your gateway and other "interesting" machines on your network for well-known APT proxies such as apt-cacher-ng and others.

```
apt install auto-apt-proxy
```

* manual configuration: this hardcodes the server name in the APT configuration and may not be appropriate if you change networks often.

```
echo 'Acquire::http { Proxy "http://proxy:3142"; }' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy
```

This assumes the server's hostname is proxy, change to its IP address or another hostname as convenient.

* You can also configure apt to check for AptCacherNg instances at one or more specific addresses, and/or fallback to using a direct connection with the following Apt configuration directive.

```
Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect "/usr/local/bin/apt-proxy-checker";
```

And creating a script at /usr/local/bin/apt-proxy-checker (or whatever location you configured) that will print out the address:port of AptCacherNg, or print “DIRECT” to use no proxy. This permits falling back to alternative AptCacherNg locations if one is down.

Using “DIRECT” as the final fallback value also prevents Apt from hanging and not updating packages.

There are several ways to check for listening addresses, such as using netcat with  nc -w1 -z $ADDR $PORT.

## HTTPS repositories

apt-cacher-ng will obviously fail to serve HTTPS repositories. There are [many solutions upstream](https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/html/howtos.html#ssluse) but I have found the simplest solution to be to simply tunnel HTTPS connections directly on the proxy, by putting this in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf:

```
PassThroughPattern: ^(.*):443$
```

This is, as far as I can tell, the only way to avoid doing a special configuration on the clients for HTTPS repositories. The downside is that HTTPS content is not cached.

## Maintenance tasks

It may happen that a client gets Hash Sum mismatch errors that yield to unverified signatures, such as:

```
    W: GPG error: http://127.0.0.1:3142/repo/suite distro InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 94AA13895F2AED87
    W: The repository 'http://127.0.0.1:3142/repo/suite distro InRelease' is not signed.
    E: Failed to fetch http://127.0.0.1:3142/repo/suite/dists/distro/main/source/Sources.gz  Hash Sum mismatch
```

This issue can be solved by cleaning cache files that may be expired, by running:

```
curl http://proxy:3142/acng-report.html?abortOnErrors=aOe&byPath=bP&byChecksum=bS&truncNow=tN&incomAsDamaged=iad&purgeNow=pN&doExpire=Start+Scan+and%2For+Expiration&calcSize=cs&asNeeded=an#bottom
```

The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool   program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142,   even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line   option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is   active by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an   unprivileged port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will   receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these   requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf.   This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind   to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-07-26 05:49:15 UTC  ``` URL references commit 3b91874b, looks like we may be good here now?:  apt-cacher-ng $ git tag --contains=3b91874b debian/3.3.1-1 debian/3.3.1-2 debian/3.3.1-2_bpo10+1 debian/3.3.1-2_bpo9+1 debian/3.4-1 debian/3.5-1 upstream/3.4 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-30 04:42:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Helmert III (ajak) from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=705962#c5)) > URL references commit 3b91874b, looks like we may be good here now?: >  > apt-cacher-ng $ git tag --contains=3b91874b > debian/3.3.1-1 > debian/3.3.1-2 > debian/3.3.1-2_bpo10+1 > debian/3.3.1-2_bpo9+1 > debian/3.4-1 > debian/3.5-1 > upstream/3.4  debian/3.3.1-1 was first in tree before this bug was filed and cleanup is long done.
