Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5804:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `deleteEventLogFile` method within the `GWTTestServiceImpl` class in Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI lacks proper validation of user-supplied paths before using them in file deletion operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal flaw. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path provided to the `deleteEventLogFile` method to reach and delete files outside of the intended directory.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the file path received from the user, leading to the path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the system where the Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI is running. This can lead to data loss, system instability, or denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The file deletion occurs with the privileges of the SYSTEM user on Windows or root on Linux, potentially allowing for the deletion of critical system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI.
- The attacker must be able to send specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious path to be deleted.

**Technical Details**

The provided content includes a demonstration of how to exploit this vulnerability using `curl` commands, which includes:
1. Obtaining the session ID.
2. Authenticating.
3. Sending a crafted request to the `deleteEventLogFile` with a path traversal payload like `../../../../../../../../../tmp/delete_me.txt`
