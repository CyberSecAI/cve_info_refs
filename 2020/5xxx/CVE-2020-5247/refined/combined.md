We're in completely unchartered territory with the hypervisor kernel.  I think we're making a big mistake here that could cost us valuable testers. If test3 is broken for some user, they'll have to reinstall without xen before they can do anything, as opposed to just grabbing updates.  If this were test1, I'd throw caution to the wind, but this is our last chance to 'get it right' before we ship.    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c3)  Jeremy Katz    2006-02-20 20:28:58 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 181750](show_bug.cgi?id=181750 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - enabling xen group should still install non-xen kernel") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c4)  Jeremy Katz    2006-02-24 23:10:00 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 182988](show_bug.cgi?id=182988 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Anaconda virt install needs to install a backup non-Xen kernel too") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c5)  Stephen Tweedie    2006-02-26 04:01:25 UTC  ``` Agreed with davej; right now "it doesn't boot out of the box on $foo hardware/config" is the most common Xen bug we deal with.  It's going to be a big turn-off if this results in a lot of installs that don't offer a fallback to a working kernel.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c6)  Jeremy Katz    2006-02-27 17:55:51 UTC  ``` Arguably, we're having that problem a lot with the non-Xen kernel right now too :-/  Having the fallback really doesn't help a lot as we a) Don't show the grub menu by default b) Don't make it easy to change your default (and future defaults as that gets hard-coded) c) End up just downloading what doesn't work for you endlessly.  I'm strongly convinced we either need to 1) be confident enough about it working that we can install it and not worry or 2) not have it be a visible option. The "install a different kernel in case it's broken" option is just silly.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c7)  Brian Stein    2006-02-28 13:36:07 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 183321](show_bug.cgi?id=183321 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - xen kernel in FC5test3 does not boot") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c8)  Dax Kelson    2006-02-28 17:34:11 UTC  ``` I too thought just having the Xen hypervisor installed was a bit odd. If even from a "flexibility" point of view rather then a "fallback" one.  Other distros (such as SUSE), when you install XEN have both options in the GRUB menu.  This makes sense as you may want Xen available for when you want it, but not have it be the only option.  On the "might be a bug" front, I couldn't get software suspend to work when booted to the Xen hypervisor, but it did work OK when booted to the normal Linux kernel. (this was an un-updated FC5t3 box)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c9)  Mike A. Harris    2006-02-28 18:53:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c0)) > right now, only offering to run under the hypervisor isn't a good idea, as it's > very fragile on x86-64 (I've not tried 32bit). >  > We need a fallback option to a regular bare-metal kernel in grub, or users are > going to be left with unusable installs that they can't update.  Indeed.  I just encountered that myself.  Installed 3 times, and chose to install xen, thinking "yeah, I'd like to check xen in FC5 out sometime when I have some spare time", and _assuming_ that it would install the normal kernel also.  After install, I got the xen kernel only and thought I must have screwed up. The xen kernel wouldn't boot, so I reinstalled, and got the same problem. I could not find anywhere in the installer where I could opt into installing the regular kernel.  I rebooted in rescue mode and couldn't get a shell from the installer.  Gave up and booted FC4, downloaded the missing kernel, mounted the FC5 root, chrooted to it, and tried to install the kernel and got a SEGV and some other errors.  Gave up, reinstalled again and did not choose xen this time.  The install finally succeeded.  (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c1)) > The same could be said of needing the UP kernel if we install the SMP kernel.  Sure, so we install both the SMP and UP kernel then too.  Good idea.  > Realistically, offering a "fallback" doesn't really help things much and it just > needs to work.  If it doesn't, I want to hear that it's not so that we can make > sure to fix things.  Damn right it helps things, unless we expect users who maybe want to try out xen, to stand on their heads and reinstall the OS 5 times, get sick of wasting their time, declare Fedora unuseable, and switch to Debian/Gentoo/Mandrake/ whatever.  Can we please install a useable system, and provide fallbacks in case that might not be completely a stable reliable thing right now?  At a bare minimum, at least have a method in the installer of allowing the end user to say "Yeah, I want a normal kernel with the xen kernel."  I wasted almost an entire day screwing around with this.  If FC5 ships the same way, then we're really regressing "ease of use" bigtime.    (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c8)) > I too thought just having the Xen hypervisor installed was a bit odd. If even > from a "flexibility" point of view rather then a "fallback" one.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's just a common sense thing IMHO. It's not like the disk space extra kernels consume really matter nowadays.  > Other distros (such as SUSE), when you install XEN have both options in the > GRUB menu.  Hmm, perhaps I should give OpenSUSE a whirl in my quest for a useable OS. ;o)    > This makes sense as you may want Xen available for when you want it, but not > have it be the only option.  Exactly.  Xen is new technology, and many people are not too familiar with it, but may want to experiment with it.  Forcing people to choose Xen only or non-Xen during install is really artificially limiting things very ridiculously.  It's not that the normal kernel(s) should be installed too as a fallback if xen doesn't work per se. it's more that people do not necessarily want to make a strict decision between xen or non-xen.  This is very very disappointing to me to get the feeling that we're about to release FC5, and we're going to screw over users like this.  There's going to be a lot of bad reviews of FC5 due to this.  <SIGH>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c10)  Jeremy Katz    2006-02-28 20:10:58 UTC  ``` We're taking Xen out as a user-visible option for FC5 based on the fact that it's not ready.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c11)  Mike A. Harris    2006-02-28 21:02:45 UTC  ``` That's a reasonable solution too I guess.  Presumeably Xen will still be available to experiment with manually in FC5, or is the kernel no longer present?  I tried to install the xen kernel via yum and couldn't find it.  Was kindof hoping I could help narrow things down for the "doesn't boot" issue.  If not, I'll wait until rawhide's rolling again and pick up xen from there I suppose.  Going to do an x86_64 install over the next few days as well and see how I fare with that.  TIA     ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=181618#c12)  Dax Kelson    2006-03-02 18:01:18 UTC  ``` BTW, today SUSE delayed 10.1 by a month (I think). Xen was mentioned as a big reason.  from the opensuse-announce mailing list.  "We have looked at the current status of our beta versions of SUSE Linux 10.1 and determined that we would like to spent more time to strengthen the quality of SUSE Linux 10.1 especially in the area of virtualization (Xen hypervisor) and package management features.  We also like to address all blockers.  We have therefore revised the schedule for SUSE Linux 10.1 and like to give an outlook beyond 10.1 as well."  Presumably SLES10 is slipping from a May 6th release as well.   ``` |  |

Package        : puma
Version        : 3.6.0-1+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16770 CVE-2020-5247 CVE-2022-23634
Debian Bug     : 946312 952766 1005391

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in puma, a web server for
Ruby/Rack applications. These flaws may lead to information leakage due to not
always closing response bodies, allowing untrusted input in a response header
(HTTP Response Splitting) and thus potentially facilitating several other
attacks like cross-site scripting. A poorly-behaved client could also use
keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service
attack.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.6.0-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your puma packages.

For the detailed security status of puma please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/puma>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# HTTP Response Splitting

Thank you for visiting OWASP.org. We have migrated our community to a new web platform and regretably the content for this page needed to be programmatically ported from its previous wiki page. There’s still some work to be done.

This is an example of a Project or Chapter Page.

## Description

HTTP response splitting occurs when:

* Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most
  frequently an HTTP request.
* The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user
  without being validated for malicious characters.

HTTP response splitting is a means to an end, not an end in itself. At
its root, the attack is straightforward: an attacker passes malicious
data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data
in an HTTP response header.

To mount a successful exploit, the application must allow input that
contains CR (carriage return, also given by %0d or \r) and LF (line
feed, also given by %0a or \n)characters into the header AND the
underlying platform must be vulnerable to the injection of such
characters. These characters not only give attackers control of the
remaining headers and body of the response the application intends to
send, but also allow them to create additional responses entirely under
their control.

The example below uses a Java example, but this issue has been fixed in
virtually all modern Java EE application servers. If you are concerned
about this risk, you should test on the platform of concern to see if
the underlying platform allows for CR or LF characters to be injected
into headers. We suspect that, in general, this vulnerability has been
fixed in most modern application servers, regardless of what language
the code has been written in.

## Examples

The following code segment reads the name of the author of a weblog
entry, author, from an HTTP request and sets it in a cookie header of an
HTTP response.

```
String author = request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM);
...
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("author", author);
    cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);
    response.addCookie(cookie);

```

Assuming a string consisting of standard alpha-numeric characters, such
as “Jane Smith”, is submitted in the request the HTTP response including
this cookie might take the following form:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Set-Cookie: author=Jane Smith
...

```

However, because the value of the cookie is formed of unvalidated user
input, the response will only maintain this form if the value submitted
for AUTHOR\_PARAM does not contain any CR and LF characters. If an
attacker submits a malicious string, such as “Wiley
Hacker\r\nContent-Length:999\r\n\r\n…”, then the HTTP response
would be split into an imposter response followed by the original
response, which is now ignored:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Set-Cookie: author=Wiley Hacker
Content-Length: 999

<html>malicious content...</html> (to 999th character in this example)
Original content starting with character 1000, which is now ignored by the web browser...

```

The ability of the attacker to construct arbitrary HTTP responses
permits a variety of resulting attacks, including: [Cross-User
Defacement](Cross-User_Defacement "wikilink"), [Cache
Poisoning](Cache_Poisoning "wikilink"), [Cross-site Scripting
(XSS)](Cross-site_Scripting_%5C%28XSS%5C%29 "wikilink") and [Page
Hijacking](Page_Hijacking "wikilink").

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# CVE-2019-16254: HTTP response splitting in WEBrick (Additional fix)

Posted by mame on 1 Oct 2019

There is an HTTP response splitting vulnerability in WEBrick bundled with Ruby. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2019-16254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16254).

## Details

If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients.

This is the same issue as [CVE-2017-17742](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/03/28/http-response-splitting-in-webrick-cve-2017-17742/). The previous fix was incomplete, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

## Affected Versions

* All releases that are Ruby 2.3 or earlier
* Ruby 2.4 series: Ruby 2.4.7 or earlier
* Ruby 2.5 series: Ruby 2.5.6 or earlier
* Ruby 2.6 series: Ruby 2.6.4 or earlier
* Ruby 2.7.0-preview1
* prior to master commit 3ce238b5f9795581eb84114dcfbdf4aa086bfecc

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to [znz](https://hackerone.com/znz) for discovering this issue.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

## Package

bundler

puma
([rubygems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 4.3.2, < 3.12.3

## Patched versions

4.3.3, 3.12.4

## Description

### Impact

If an application using Puma allows untrusted input in a response header, an attacker can use newline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF` or`/r`, `/n`) to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as [HTTP Response Splitting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting).

While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

This is related to [CVE-2019-16254](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w9fp-2996-hhwx "CVE-2019-16254"), which fixed this vulnerability for the WEBrick Ruby web server.

### Patches

This has been fixed in 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking all headers for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.

### Workarounds

Add a Rack middleware to your application which accomplishes the same header check:

```
class HTTPResponseSplittingMiddleware
  CRLF_REGEX = /[\r\n]/.freeze

  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
    status, headers, body = @app.call(env)
    headers.reject! { |_k, v| CRLF_REGEX =~ v.to_s }
    [status, headers, body]
  end
end
```

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at nate.berkopec@speedshop.co,
richard.schneeman+no-recruiters@gmail.com, or evan@phx.io. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4,
available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html>
