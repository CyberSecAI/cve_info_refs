Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on social network fields within the `ps_socialfollow` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module does not validate that the provided values for social media links are actually valid URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because unsanitized user-supplied input (social network URLs) is directly embedded into the HTML output of the page.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The module fails to validate that social network fields contain URLs. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code in these fields

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via the social network fields. This code would then be executed in the victim's browser when the page is viewed, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies/session information
    - Redirect users to malicious sites
    - Modify the content of the web page
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Form Submission:**  An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within social network field when configuring the module. This could be achieved through a crafted module configuration or directly through the admin interface.
- **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is executed when the page is loaded by a victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Admin Access**: The attacker must have administrative access or be able to get administrative access to the PrestaShop instance. This could happen through social engineering, or by compromising an account.

**Additional Information:**
-   The vulnerability is present in module versions before 2.1.0.
-   The fix in version 2.1.0 introduces URL validation for the social network fields using Symfony's Validator component.
-   The severity is considered low. This is likely due to the need for admin access to exploit it.
