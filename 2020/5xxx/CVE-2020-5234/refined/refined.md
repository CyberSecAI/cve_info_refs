Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5234:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from two main issues within the MessagePack library when deserializing data from untrusted sources:

1.  **Hash Collisions:** The library was susceptible to hash collision attacks. When deserializing data into hash-based collections (e.g., `Dictionary<K, V>`, `HashSet<T>`), if the keys had a high number of hash collisions, it could lead to excessive CPU consumption.
2.  **Stack Overflow:** The deserialization process could lead to a stack overflow due to deeply nested object graphs. An attacker could craft malicious messagepack data that would deserialize into a very deep object graph, leading to a `StackOverflowException` and crashing the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Hash Collision Resistance:** The default hash functions used by the library were not sufficiently resistant to hash collisions, allowing an attacker to craft malicious input.
*   **Uncontrolled Deserialization Depth:** The library didn't have proper controls to limit the depth of the object graph being deserialized, which could lead to stack overflow.
*   **Incorrect `MessagePackSecurity` Copy Constructor:** When a `MessagePackSecurity` instance is mutated, the copy constructor didn't initialize its `objectFallbackEqualityComparer` field, causing `MessagePackSecurity.GetEqualityComparer<object>` to return null which defeats the hash collision fixes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a denial of service by:
    *   Consuming excessive CPU resources by triggering hash collisions, making the server or application unresponsive.
    *   Crashing the application or server by causing a stack overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted MessagePack Data:** The primary attack vector is through the deserialization of messagepack data from untrusted sources, such as user input, network traffic, or files. An attacker can craft specific data to trigger hash collisions or create deeply nested object graphs.
*   **Lack of Custom Formatter Implementation:** Custom formatters that don't implement the security mitigations using `MessagePackSecurity` could also be used to perform the attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious Data:** An attacker needs the ability to supply crafted messagepack data to a vulnerable application or service that uses the MessagePack library for deserialization.
*  **Understanding of MessagePack Serialization:** An attacker will need to understand the messagepack format to craft payloads to trigger the vulnerability.
* **No authentication required**: The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to cause this vulnerability, as long as they can send the crafted malicious data to the application.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple MessagePack libraries: `MessagePack`, `MessagePack.ImmutableCollection`, `MessagePack.ReactiveProperty`, `MessagePack.Unity`.
*   The issue exists in versions `0.0-1.8.x` and `2.0.x`, and is fixed in versions `1.9.11` and `2.1.90`.
*   The fix involves upgrading the library and adding code to put MessagePack into the defensive `UntrustedData` mode.
*   The `MessagePackSecurity` class is introduced, providing settings to balance performance, functionality, and security.
*   `IEqualityComparer<T>` implementations for hash collision resistance were added.
*   For 1.x, `MessagePackSecurity.Active = MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData` needs to be set. For 2.x, you should configure `MessagePackSerializerOptions.Security` with `MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData`.
*   Custom formatters need to use `MessagePackSecurity.DepthStep()` to mitigate stack overflows and use `MessagePackSecurity.Active.GetEqualityComparer<T>()` to mitigate hash collisions.
