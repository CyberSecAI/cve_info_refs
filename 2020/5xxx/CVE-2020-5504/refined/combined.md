Package        : phpmyadmin
Version        : 4:4.2.12-2+deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-5504
Debian Bug     : 948718

In phpMyAdmin 4 before 4.9.4 and 5 before 5.0.1, SQL injection exists in the
user accounts page. A malicious user could inject custom SQL in place of their
own username when creating queries to this page. An attacker must have a valid
MySQL account to access the server.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
4:4.2.12-2+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2020-5504 – SQL Injection with Missing Functional Level Access in phpMyAdmin

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/high.png)

Severity:High

#### Vendor

##### PhpMyAdmin

#### Affected Product

##### phpMyAdmin 4.x versions prior to 4.9.4 are affected, phpMyAdmin 5.x version 5.0.0

#### CVE

##### CVE-2020-5504

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-12-1032

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### December 12, 2019

### Description

A SQL injection (SQLi) refers to an injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious SQL statements that control a web application’s database server. Missing functional level access flaws allow attackers to access unauthorized functionality. SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability was identified with the conjunction of missing function level access in the latest version of the phpMyAdmin database. The vulnerability affects http://localhost/phpmyadmin/server\_privileges.php, username.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on phpMyAdmin version 5.0.

Issue: SQL Injection with missing functional level access:

1. Log in to the phpMyAdmin GUI

2. Installed PhpMyAdmin (Version 5.0)

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image1.png)

***Figure 01:* *phpMyAdmin Installed Version 5.0.0***

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png)

***Figure 02:* *List of user accounts and privileges in the database.***

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-3.png)

***Figure 03:* *Test user doesnât have global privileges just for information.***

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-4.png)

![]()![]()![]()![]()![]()![]()![]()![]()***Figure 04:* *âTestâ user has all privilege to test the database only.***

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5.png)

***Figure 05:* *Log in to phpMyAdmin with âtestâ user credentials.***

***Â Now, enable an http-based proxy on the browser to intercept the traffic to the server.***

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-6.png)

***Figure 06:* *âTestâ* *users don’t have enough privilege to view users and other databases.***

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-7.png)

***Figure 07:* *The intercepted ajax call in the proxy is related to the user accounts page.***

![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-8.png)

***Figure 08:* *JavaScript file which related to server\_privileges.php page Ajax calls.***

![](data:image/png;base64...)***Figure 09:* *JavaScript code, which is responsible for checking the existence of the username in the database.***

![](data:image/png;base64...)***Figure 10:* *The modified Ajax call which was intercepted in Burp with the required details to make validate\_username***

![](data:image/png;base64...)***Figure 11:* *As per the privileges, the user shouldnât be able to access this ajax call. But the server is giving a SQL error in the response. The response for the Ajax call confirms that the request is vulnerable to Missing Functional Level Access.***

![](data:image/png;base64...)***Figure 12:* *An* *unauthorized (test) user was able to control the SQL statement, which is responsible for validating username.***

![](data:image/png;base64...)***Figure* *13: Difference in the responses of the previous request and the current request confirms the username field is vulnerable to SQL injection.***

### Impact

An authenticated user who has the privileges to one database at least can retrieve the contents of the databases in the MySQL DBMS server. Under the right circumstances, SQLi can also be used by an attacker to execute OS commands, which may then be used to escalate an attack even further.

### Remediations

Download the following patches advised as per the vendor.

For 4.8, 4.9 versions: upgrade to version 4.9.4 or newer,Â 5.x: upgrade to version 5.0.1, or newer, or apply the patch below.

Older versions: https://gist.github.com/ibennetch/4c1b701f4b766e4dd5556e8e26200b6b
