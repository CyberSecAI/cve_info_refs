Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-5646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a NULL Pointer Dereference in the TCP/IP stack of the affected Mitsubishi Electric GOT1000 Series GT14 model devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference:** The software attempts to dereference a pointer that has a NULL value. This occurs within the TCP/IP stack of the device firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted TCP/IP packets, an attacker can trigger the NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to the device's network functions entering a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network. Attackers send specially crafted TCP/IP packets to the vulnerable device.
*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The CISA advisory notes that the vulnerability is "low skill level to exploit".

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** Mitsubishi Electric GOT1000 Series GT14 models with CoreOS version 05.65.00.BD and earlier are affected. Specific models include: GT1455-QTBDE, GT1450-QMBDE, GT1450-QLBDE, GT1455HS-QTBDE, and GT1450HS-QMBDE.
*   **Mitigation:** Updating the device firmware to CoreOS version 05.76.00.BG or later is the primary mitigation. Additionally, limiting network access to the device to only trusted networks and hosts can help reduce the risk.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
