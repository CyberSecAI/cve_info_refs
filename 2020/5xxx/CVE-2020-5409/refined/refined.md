The provided content relates to CVE-2020-5409.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Concourse login flow, specifically how it handles OAuth redirects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
- Upon successful redirection, the attacker can potentially gain access to the user's access token in Concourse.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious link containing the OAuth redirect parameter with a target pointing to an untrusted website.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to click the link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click on the generated link.
