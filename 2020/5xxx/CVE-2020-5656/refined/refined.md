The provided documents describe multiple vulnerabilities affecting Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-R series modules. This response focuses on CVE-2020-5656.

**Vulnerability:** Improper Access Control (CWE-284)

**Root Cause:** The TCP/IP stack within the affected modules has improper access control mechanisms.

**Affected Systems:**
*   MELSEC iQ-R Series EtherNet/IP Network Interface Module (RJ71EIP91: Serial No. upper 2 digits are "02" or below)
*   MELSEC iQ-R Series PROFINET IO Controller Module (RJ71PN92: Serial No. upper 2 digits are "01" or below)
*   MELSEC iQ-R Series High Speed Data Logger Module (RD81DL96: Serial No. upper 2 digits are "08" or below)
*   MELSEC iQ-R Series MES Interface Module (RD81MES96N: Serial No. upper 2 digits are "04" or below)
*  MELSEC iQ-R Series OPC UA Server Module (RD81OPC96: Serial No. upper 2 digits are "04" or below)

**Impact:**
*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to the affected modules.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition by disrupting network functionality.

**Attack Vector:** Network-based. Specifically, sending specially crafted network packets to the affected modules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require any privileges on the target system.
*   The attacker needs network access to the affected module.

**Mitigation:**
*   Apply the updates provided by the vendor.
    *   RJ71EIP91: Serial No. upper 2 digits are "03" or later
