Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5785:

**CVE-2020-5785**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient output sanitization of user-supplied input within the Teltonika firmware. Specifically, the 'action' and 'pkg\_name' parameters in HTTP GET or POST requests to `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/packages/check_sig` are not properly sanitized before being used in the web interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This can be leveraged to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to a malicious website. In this specific case, an attacker could trick a user with higher privileges to trigger the XSS and steal their session details.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the 'action' or 'pkg\_name' parameters. An attacker would need to entice a user into visiting the crafted URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user (preferably with higher privileges) into clicking on a malicious link.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerable parameters are `action` and `pkg_name`.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/packages/check_sig` endpoint.
*   The content provides two proof-of-concept examples, one demonstrating the vulnerability via the `action` parameter and the other using the `pkg_name` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is present in Teltonika firmware `TRB2_R_00.02.04.3`.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to firmware `TRB2_R_00.02.05.1` or newer.
