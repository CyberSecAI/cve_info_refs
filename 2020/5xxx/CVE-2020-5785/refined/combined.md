# Teltonika Gateway TRB245 Multiple Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

#### CVE-2020-5784: Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.4

CVSSv3 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

The pkg\_link parameter used in the verify\_package function from /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/packages.lua allows a low privilege user to download files from external network devices to the device.

This is because the pkg\_link is controlled by the user and is then passed directly to a curl command without any verification that it is to a Teltonika domain. This allows the user to cause the application to send a request to an arbitrary URL.

![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/tra307-1.png)
##### Proof of concept

When browsing to the below URL we are able to make an HTTP request to an external URL which is then downloaded to the device.

```

http://192.168.1.5/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/packages/check_sig?pkg_link=http://192.168.1.135:8000/ssrf&pkg_pkg=tlt_custom_pkg_easycwmp&pkg_name=TR-069&action=install

```

Note that to test this you will need to update the IP address of the target router and the external device you want to connect to via the SSRF.

![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/tra307-2.png)

File downloaded to device via SSRF

Note that this can be achieved as a user in the user group by default.

In one of my tests I was able to download a large file that significantly impacted the device's performance/availability.

#### CVE-2020-5785: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.1

CVSSv3 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

It was discovered that it is possible to execute malicious JavaScript in the device's web user interface by injecting HTML script tags into either the ‘Action’ or ‘pkg\_name’ parameters in an HTTP GET or POST
request to '/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/packages/check\_sig'. An attacker could exploit this to trick a user with higher privileges to trigger the Cross-Site scripting and steal their session details.

##### Proof of Concept

**Example 1 “action”:**
When browsing to the below URL some javascript will be executed in the user’s browser, as we can see in the screenshot below.

```

http://192.168.1.5/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/packages/check_sig?pkg_link=https://wiki.teltonika-networks.com/wikibase/images/8/8d/Networking_trb2xx_manual_packages_azure_iothub_2020-07-09.ipk&pkg_pkg=tlt_custom_pkg_easycwmp&pkg_name=TR-069&action="><script>alert(1)</script><!--

```
![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/tra307-3.png)

Cross-Site Scripting PoC (action parameter)

**Example 2 “pkg\_name”:**
When browsing to the below URL some javascript will be executed in the user’s browser, as we can see in the screenshot below.

```

http://192.168.1.5/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/packages/check_sig?pkg_link=https://wiki.teltonika-networks.com/wikibase/images/8/8d/Networking_trb2xx_manual_packages_azure_iothub_2020-07-09.ipk&pkg_pkg=tlt_custom_pkg_easycwmp&pkg_name=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22)%3C/script%3E&action=install

```
![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/tra307-4.png)

Cross-Site Scripting PoC (pkg\_name parameter)

#### CVE-2020-5786: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.4

CVSSv3 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

There is no CSRF protection for the below request. By tricking an authenticated user into clicking a link, the attacker is able to force the user to execute the packages/check\_sig action. This will cause requests to be made to URLs of the attacker’s choosing along with download of the file. As with the SSRF, a large file download can significantly impact the availability of the device.

This is a particularly bad issue in this case since there is reflected Cross-Site Scripting and SSRF issues here.

The CSRF could be exploited in such a way that the XSS would be triggered as well (via a form post). This would allow the XSS to be exploited by sending a more innocuous URL. An attacker could exploit this issue by creating a dummy page that would execute javascript in an authenticated users session if they were tricked into using the malicious dummy page.

##### Proof of concept

```

#### CVE-2020-5787: Authenticated Directory Traversal Arbitrary File Deletion admin/services/packages/remove

CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.5

CVSSv3 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)

An authenticated arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the package removal functionality in TRB245 allows a privileged user to arbitrarily delete files on the underlying operating system.
This is because in /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/packages.lua the opkg\_remove function does not validate the value of the “package” parameter. It does not verify that the package actually points to a valid package file.

```

function opkg_remove()
 local package_name = luci.http.formvalue("package")
 local result = _opkg("remove", package_name)
 luci.http.prepare_content("application/json")
 luci.http.write_json(result)
 end

```

Note that this can be achieved as a user in the admin group by default.

#### Proof of concept

The below POST request will delete /etc/passwd and render the device inaccessible.

```

POST /cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/remove HTTP/1.1

Note that to test this you will need to update the IP address, cookies and CSRF token.

#### CVE-2020-5788: Authenticated Directory Traversal Arbitrary File Deletion admin/system/admin/certificates/delete

CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.5

CVSSv3 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)

An authenticated arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the certificate removal functionality in TRB245 allows a privileged user to arbitrarily delete files on the underlying operating system.
This is because in /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/administration.lua the remove\_certificate function does not validate the value of the “file” parameter. It does not verify that the file being deleted is the intended file.

```

function remove_certificate()
 local file_name = luci.http.formvalue("file")
 local full_path = "/etc/certificates/" .. file_name
 local log_file = "/etc/certificates/status/info"

if nixio.fs.access(full_path) then
 luci.util.ubus("file", "exec", \{command="sed", params={"-i", "/" .. file_name .. "/d", log_file}})
 nixio.fs.remove(full_path)
 end
 luci.http.redirect(luci.dispatcher.build_url("admin/system/admin/certificates/manager"))
 end

```

Note that this can be achieved as a user in the admin group by default.

##### Proof of concept

The below POST request will delete /etc/passwd and render the device inaccessible.

```

#### CVE-2020-5789: Authenticated Directory Traversal Arbitrary File Read

CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.5

CVSSv3 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

An authenticated directory traversal vulnerability in the certificate download functionality in TRB245 allows a low-privileged user to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system as root.
This is because in /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/administration.lua the download\_certificate function does not validate the value of the “file” parameter. It does not verify that the file being downloaded is the intended certificate.

```

function download_certificate()
 local file_name = luci.http.formvalue("file")
 local full_path = "/etc/certificates/" .. file_name
 if nixio.fs.access(full_path) then
 luci.http.setfilehandler(
 function(meta, chunk, eof)
 if not fp then
 fp = io.open(full_path, "w")
 end

if chunk then
 fp:write(chunk)
 end

if eof then
 fp:close()
 end
 end
 )

local reader = ltn12_popen("cat " .. full_path)
 luci.http.header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename='..file_name..'')
 luci.http.prepare_content("text/html")
 luci.ltn12.pump.all(reader, luci.http.write)
 else
 luci.http.redirect(luci.dispatcher.build_url("admin/system/admin/certificates/manager"))
 end
 end

```

Note that this can be achieved as a user in the user group by default.

##### Proof of concept

We can browse to the below URL to demonstrate this vulnerability.

```

### Disclosure Timeline

08/12/2020 - Vulnerability report sent to Teltonika via their web form. 90-day date is November 10, 2020.
08/13/2020 - Teltonika has received and reviewed the report. They will provide their initial assessment by the end of tomorrow.
08/13/2020 - Tenable acknowledges.
08/14/2020 - Teltonika can reproduce the vulnerabilities. There is no ETA or or further details. Will update on Monday.
08/17/2020 - Teltonika is working on the fixes. No ETA. Will update us once there are more details.
08/17/2020 - Tenable acknowledges.
08/28/2020 - Teltonika says a test firmware is being tested, and once the vulnerabilities are fixed, they will release it with RUTOSv2.5 (TRB2XX\_R\_00.02.05) firmware. They'll inform us at least a day before official release.
09/10/2020 - Tenable asks for an update.
09/11/2020 - Teltonika internally released RUTOSv2.5. They will run auto-tests over the weekend. If no issues are found they will publicly release the firmware on Monday.
