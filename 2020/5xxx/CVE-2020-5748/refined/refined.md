Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Insufficient output sanitization in TCExam 14.2.2 during the self-registration process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- This JavaScript will be executed when an administrator interacts with the affected user data, specifically when updating or deleting a username containing the malicious script tags. This could lead to a range of malicious actions performed in the context of the administrator's session.
- The attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions, steal sensitive information, or further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by user self-registration through the application's front end.
- Specifically, the attacker crafts a malicious username containing HTML script tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication to inject the malicious payload during self-registration.
- The attacker's malicious script is executed when an administrator interacts with the crafted user data.
