- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Spring Integration framework's Kryo Codec implementations, when configured with default options, resolve unregistered classes on demand. This allows for "deserialization gadget" exploits where malicious code can be executed during deserialization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability lies in the default Kryo configuration which does not restrict classes during deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution due to the deserialization of malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted serialized data containing malicious code to the Spring Integration application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send data to the vulnerable application that will be deserialized by the Kryo Codec. This typically involves network access or an interface to supply the malicious data.
