    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-5782",
      "description": "In IgniteNet HeliOS GLinq v2.2.1 r2961, if a user logs in and sets the ‘wan_type’ parameter, the wan interface for the device will become unreachable, which results in a denial of service condition for devices dependent on this connection.",
      "root_cause": "The 'wan_type' parameter, accepted during the login process, allows modification of the 'proto' configuration for the WAN interface.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation leading to configuration modification"
       ],
      "impact": "Setting the 'wan_type' parameter to an arbitrary value breaks the WAN interface, rendering the device unreachable via Ethernet.",
      "attack_vector": "A crafted HTTP request to the login page including the 'wan_type' parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be authenticated to the device.",
      "additional_information": "The modified 'proto' value is written to the device's network configuration file (/etc/config/network)."
