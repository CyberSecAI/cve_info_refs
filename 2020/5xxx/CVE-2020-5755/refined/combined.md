# Webroot Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Webroot endpoint agents under version v9.0.28.48 are vulnerable to the following issues.

#### **CVE-2020-5754 - Type Confusion**

This Type Confusion vulnerability is in wrUrl.dll which can result in locally or remotely crashing the Webroot service as well as remotely reading contents of memory in the Webroot service. When wrUrl.dll is listening for incoming JSON data, an attacker can call "OP" 1, which will result in wrUrl.dll traversing the "DATA" list from the attacker's supplied JSON object. The problem is that the elements in the DATA list are not type checked, and instead assumed to be JSON objects themselves. If an attacker passes a LIST object in this "DATA" list, wrUrl will attempt to key the "URL" value on a list object. By providing a DATA element of ["URL"], the keying operation of "URL" will succeed, however will mistakenly return the next list element's contents. The next element can be another list which contains a string of an encoded pointer, which will later be dereferenced and its pointer contents will be echoed back to the client in the "URL" ouput parameter. Below is an example of this via Curl and how it reads the contents of a dll loaded in memory.

**Example:**

```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/urltree; charset=utf-8" -d "{\"VER\":1, \"OP\":1, \"DATA\":[[\"URL\"], [\"\\u004c\\u0000\\u0064\\u007311111111111111111\"]], \"BRWSR\":\"Chrome\"}" [10.0.2.5:27019](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__10.0.2.5-3A27019&d=DwMFaQ&c=ZgVRmm3mf2P1-XDAyDsu4A&r=O7-8ZF9l56sIru_ZGplSuiGau96I4tZ-SFdmNuMRDps&m=xYq_7B-j6sVSYqMV85qg0M5aNzFdrW4noN0uKwWyr_c&s=Pmje4bH9So-sUEp_c_5p2JiHFNkH5lk2_st_uSA4A_Q&e=)
```

**Response (contents of a dll in memory is returned back over the network):**

```
{"VER":1,"OP":1,"ERR":0,"DATA":[{"URL":"�!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.\r\r\n$","CAT.CONF":["0.0"],"BCRI":40,"ALCAT":0,"RTAP":0,"BLK":0,"REF":0}]}
```

#### CVE-2020-5755 - Local Privilege Escalation

This is due to the %PROGRAMDATA%\WrData\ folder (which contains .dlls that are loaded by the WebRoot service) not being protected against writes. In this scenario, an attacker could trigger the type-confusion bug to crash the service locally, then rename the %PROGRAMDATA%\WrData\PKG to %PROGRAMDATA%\WrData\PKG2, craft their own %PROGRAMDATA%\WrData\PKG directory, and supply their own WrUrl.dll or wrPhreshPhish.dll to hijack the dll when service auto-restarts resulting in privilege escalation to SYSTEM.

### Solution

Update to Webroot v9.0.28.48

### Disclosure Timeline

03-16-2020 - Tenable discloses vulnerabilities to Webroot
03-17-2020 - Tenable Follows up, offering extension due to extenuating circumstances
03-17-2020 - Webroot acknowledges disclosure and is investigating issue
04-02-2020 - Tenable follows up asking for update
04-02-2020 - Webroot explains they are in middle of scheduled release, expects fixes to be in released in a next version following the scheduled release
04-03-2020 - Tenable asks for estimated date for the bug fixes release date in order to arrange reasonable extension
04-11-2020 - Tenable follows up, asking for update
04-16-2020 - Webroot responds that they have a build coming next week. Asks if Tenable could confirm fixes
04-21-2020 - Tenable offers to confirm fixes, asks for copy of new build
04-21-2020 - Webroot says they will send build when ready
04-24-2020 - Webroot offers build that has fixed LPE
04-24-2020 - Tenable confirms reported LPE issue has been fixed, but mentions very similar one found that is still affecting the folder structure
04-28-2020 - Webroot responds that it is unlikely to be a problem, since Webroot process is AM-PPL and shutdown of it is unlikely. Webroot asks for 30-day extension so that customers have time to apply the patch
04-28-2020 - Tenable responds that we will not be able to provide an extension once patch is released, due to our disclosure policy. Offers a 2 week extension if they need more development/testing time
04-28-2020 - Webroot responds that they may still need 2 week extension for initial deployment. Asks if Tenable is able to share details of our planned disclosure
04-29-2020 - Tenable offers 2 week extension for an initial deployment, will follow up on details in early June. Points out past disclosures and publications to provide an example of what disclosure details will look like
06-02-2020 - Tenable follows up for update
06-03-2020 - Webroot responds that they are fine for June 15 disclosure, offers input to include in Tenable's disclosure
06-04-2020 - Tenable thanks Webroot for update
