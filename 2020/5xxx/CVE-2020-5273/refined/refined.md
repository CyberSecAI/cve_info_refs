**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5273

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in the custom URL field within the `ps_linklist` module. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected content.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacement of the website
  - Stealing user credentials
- The severity is labeled as low.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the custom URL field of the `ps_linklist` module.
- An attacker would input malicious javascript code in the form field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to access and modify the custom URL field input.
- The attacker must have the ability to save this malicious data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.1.0 of the `ps_linklist` module.
- The fix involved adding a validation to ensure the custom URL field contains a valid URL.
- The commit [83e6e0b](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_linklist/commit/83e6e0bdda2287f4d6e64127cb90c41d26b5ad82) shows the fix by adding `new Assert\Url()` to the constraints array.
