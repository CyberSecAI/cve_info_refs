Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the CVE-2020-5179 vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from `overload.cl_834eaea2_20250119_140021.html` and `overload.cl_c3624938_20250119_122134.html` directly mention "Authenticated RCE on Comtech FX Series (CVE-2020-5179)", indicating a clear relationship to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a critical vulnerability in the web application used for management and administration of the Comtech Compression Bandwidth Optimization Platform. This vulnerability allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code remotely.
  -  **Insecure Input Handling:** The web application's ping utility doesn't properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing command injection.
  -  **Insufficient Access Control:** Default credentials are used to access the administration panel, allowing easy access for attackers.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, gaining full control of the system (root access). This allows the attacker to potentially steal data, disrupt services, or use the compromised system as a foothold for further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

    - **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is present in the web application's interface, specifically within the diagnostic ping function.
    - **Command Injection:** By injecting commands within the “target IP address” input field of the ping utility, the attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

    - **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the Comtech FX Series web interface.  The content mentions the default credentials as "comtech:comtech".
    - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's management interface.
   -   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it using command injection.

**7. Additional details:**

   - The vulnerable parameter is within the "Target IP Address" field of the ping utility, accessible under Operations > Diagnostics.
  - A Python script to automate the exploit was also mentioned.
