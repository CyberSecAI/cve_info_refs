```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The OAI-PMH endpoint in Opencast versions prior to 7.6 and 8.1 was configured to allow unauthenticated access by default.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration",
      "Lack of access control on a sensitive endpoint"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated users could access all media and metadata exposed through the OAI-PMH interface. This could lead to unintentional exposure of private or sensitive content.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network access to the vulnerable Opencast instance and its OAI-PMH endpoint.",
    "required_capabilities": "No authentication is needed. The attacker only needs to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Opencast 7.6 and 8.1 were patched to require ROLE_ADMIN for accessing the OAI-PMH endpoint by default.",
    "Opencast 9 removes the OAI-PMH publication from the default workflow, forcing users to make a conscious decision to enable it."
  ],
  "workarounds": [
    "Change the required role for accessing /oaipmh from ROLE_ANONYMOUS to ROLE_ADMIN in the organization security configuration (etc/security/mh_default_org.xml)."
  ],
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-5228"
