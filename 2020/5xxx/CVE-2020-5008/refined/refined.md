- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM DataPower Gateway GUI uses HTTP POST for operations requiring client information, but also responds to GET requests on the same URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The GUI accepts and processes GET requests with URL query parameters, which could reveal sensitive information, even though it is not the intended method for these operations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Use of GET requests could potentially expose sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could send crafted GET requests with URL query parameters to the vulnerable endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the DataPower Gateway GUI.
