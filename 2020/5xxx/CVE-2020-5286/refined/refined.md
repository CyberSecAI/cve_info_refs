Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5286:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-provided data when displaying error messages after a failed file upload on the import page. Specifically, the application uses `.html()` to render error messages, which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code via the error message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application uses `.html()` to render user-provided messages instead of `.text()`, leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, cookie stealing, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement of the web page.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious filename or upload a crafted file that, when processed by the server, generates a server response with malicious content.
- This crafted server response (containing the malicious file name or message) is then displayed on the import page via the vulnerable javascript.
- A victim would have to interact with this import functionality by attempting to upload the crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the import functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a file that when rejected generates a server error message, that can then be reflected to the end user.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented in commit `fc0625fb0a9aab1835515f1bea52e8e063384da7` changes the way the error message is displayed. The code was changed from using `.html()` to using `.text()`, which treats the message content as plain text, preventing the execution of malicious code.

- The vulnerability is specific to PrestaShop version 1.7.4.0 and is fixed in version 1.7.6.5.
- The security advisory [GHSA-98j8-hvjv-x47j](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-98j8-hvjv-x47j) refers to this vulnerability.
