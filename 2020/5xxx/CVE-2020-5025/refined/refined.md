Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-5025:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in IBM Db2's `db2fm` component.
*   The root cause is improper bounds checking, which allows a local attacker to write past the end of a buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to a lack of proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
*   The attacker can gain root privileges as the `db2fm` process runs with root permissions. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system where the vulnerable Db2 instance is running.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker with the ability to interact with the vulnerable `db2fm` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to execute code locally on the system where the vulnerable Db2 instance is installed. This would likely require a user account.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   All fix pack levels of IBM Db2 V9.7, V10.1, V10.5, V11.1, and V11.5 editions on all platforms are affected.
* NetApp products incorporating the affected versions of IBM DB2 are also impacted, specifically: OnCommand Insight

**Remediation:**

*   IBM provides special builds for each impacted release with interim fixes.
*   NetApp provides a fix for OnCommand Insight in version 7.3.12.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Dijing Wang of BEIJING DBSEC TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The provided CVSS v3 score is 8.4 (HIGH) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates a severe vulnerability due to high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
