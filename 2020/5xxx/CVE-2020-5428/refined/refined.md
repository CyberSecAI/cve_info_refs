Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5428:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in Spring Cloud Task's TaskExplorer when handling specific lookup queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: User-controlled input is not properly sanitized or parameterized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive information from the database)
    - Data modification (modifying or deleting data)
    - Privilege escalation (potentially gaining higher access privileges in the database)
    - Denial of Service (disrupting database operations)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker provides malicious input through lookup queries in the TaskExplorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the TaskExplorer and influence the SQL queries being executed. This might require some level of access to the application or its APIs that expose this functionality.

**Affected versions:**
- Spring Cloud Task versions 2.2.4 and below are affected

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is resolved in Spring Cloud Task versions 2.2.5 and 2.3.0 and above. Users should upgrade to one of these versions.
