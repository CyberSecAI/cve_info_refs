Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5272:

**CVE Description:**
The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in PrestaShop.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `alias` and `search` parameters on the search page. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Input validation is insufficient as it does not sanitize the `alias` and `search` parameters

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit a maliciously crafted link.
- This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
  - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim.
  - Data theft: Accessing sensitive data within the application.
  - Defacement: Modifying the content of the web page.
  - Redirection: Redirecting the victim to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `alias` or `search` parameters.
- The victim clicks on this malicious URL.
- The server reflects the unsanitized input in the response, causing the victim's browser to execute the injected JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and disseminate malicious URLs, typically via email, social media, or other methods.
- The attacker needs no prior authentication to the target application.
- The victim needs to click the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `ec80336` which reorganized admin tabs.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.6.5 of PrestaShop.
- The fix is in commit `d3bf027`, which escapes the alias and search parameters for safe output using `Tools::safeOutput`.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity.
