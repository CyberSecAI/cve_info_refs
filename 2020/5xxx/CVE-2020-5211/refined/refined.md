Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the handling of the `AUTOCOMPLETE` configuration file option within the NetHack game. Specifically, an invalid extended command within the value of the `AUTOCOMPLETE` option can trigger this overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when data is written beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can lead to various security issues like crashes or, more severely, arbitrary code execution.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The NetHack application fails to properly validate the input provided in the `AUTOCOMPLETE` configuration option, specifically when an extended command is involved. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious data that can cause the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash: A successful exploitation can lead to a program crash due to memory corruption.
- Remote Code Execution/Privilege Escalation: More critically, an attacker could achieve remote code execution or privilege escalation by carefully crafting the overflow to inject malicious code into the process's memory. This malicious code can then be executed with the privileges of the NetHack process, which, in certain installations, may have suid/sgid privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Configuration File Manipulation: The primary attack vector involves manipulating the NetHack configuration file. An attacker can provide a crafted value for the `AUTOCOMPLETE` option, injecting the malicious extended command. This is especially relevant in shared systems where users can upload their configuration files or in situations where a compromised user's configuration file could be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Modify Configuration: The attacker must have the ability to modify or provide a NetHack configuration file that will be parsed by the vulnerable application. This can be achieved through direct access to the file system or by exploiting other vulnerabilities or mechanisms to introduce the crafted configuration file.
- System with vulnerable NetHack versions: The attacker has to target a system with a vulnerable NetHack version that is configured with suid/sgid.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects NetHack versions >= 3.6.0 and < 3.6.5.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.6.5.
- Systems with NetHack installed with suid/sgid permissions are particularly at risk, as this allows the attacker's code to run with escalated privileges.
- Shared systems where users can upload configuration files are also at higher risk.
