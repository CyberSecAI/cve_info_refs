Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5259:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `jqMix` function within the `dojox` library's jQuery wrapper. This function recursively merges properties from a source object (`props`) into a target object (`obj`).  The `jqMix` function failed to prevent the special `__proto__` property from being mixed into the target object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or filtering of the `__proto__` property during the merging process. By injecting a specially crafted `props` object that contains `__proto__`, an attacker can modify the prototype of the target object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **JavaScript Object Prototype Pollution:**  An attacker can inject or overwrite properties of the base JavaScript object's prototype. This manipulation can have widespread consequences depending on the application's code, potentially leading to:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) by altering critical properties.
    - Arbitrary code execution by leveraging specific prototype properties.
    - Unintended behavior, data corruption, and unexpected application states.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `jqMix` method is called with a malicious `props` object containing `__proto__`. The `jqMix` function's logic does not prevent the properties in the `props` object from overwriting properties in the target object, including properties of the target object's prototype.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control input:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the contents of the `props` object that is passed to the vulnerable `jqMix` function. This might be achieved through various means, including:
    - Manipulating data structures used within the application.
    - Injecting data through user input or external sources that are ultimately passed to `jqMix`.
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary object creation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch adds a check to specifically exclude the `__proto__` property during the merging process: `if(x !== '__proto__' && ((tobj[x] === undefined || tobj[x] != props[x])) && props[x] !== undefined && obj != props[x])`
- The vulnerability is present in `dojox` versions prior to 1.11.10, 1.12.0-1.12.7, 1.13.0-1.13.6, 1.14.0-1.14.5, 1.15.0-1.15.2, and 1.16.0-1.16.1.
- The issue is fixed in versions 1.16.2, 1.15.3, 1.14.6, 1.13.7, 1.12.8, and 1.11.10.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity.
- The Debian security advisory also notes that CVE-2020-5258, which is related to prototype pollution in the `deepCopy` function, was patched at the same time.
