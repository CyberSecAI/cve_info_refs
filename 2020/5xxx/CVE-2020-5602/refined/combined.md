■Mitigations

For customers who cannot immediately update the software products, Mitsubishi Electric recommends that customers take
the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities:

-Make sure that the file is obtained from the correct acquisition route when customers receive a project file or a configuration
data file from another person via mail, USB memory, file server, etc. (Or, check that there is no file of unknown source.)
-Operate the products under an account that does not have administrators privileges.
-Install an antivirus software in your personal computer using the products.
-Restrict network exposure for all control system devices or systems to the minimum necessary, and ensure that they are not
accessible from untrusted networks and hosts.
-Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
-Use Virtual Private Network (VPN) when remote access is required.
