- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a fixed null initialization vector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode in the implementation of the queryable text encryptor within Spring Security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of a fixed, predictable IV in CBC mode. This weakens the encryption, making it susceptible to attacks.
    - The queryable text encryptor is designed for encrypting data that may need to be queried, which suggests that the encrypted data will be stored in a way where attackers might gain access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the encrypted data can perform a dictionary attack to potentially derive the unencrypted values.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs access to the encrypted data generated using the vulnerable `Encryptors#queryableText(CharSequence, CharSequence)` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to data encrypted using the vulnerable method. This suggests the attacker may have gained access to the database or other storage mechanisms where the encrypted data resides.
