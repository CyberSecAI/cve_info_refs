Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a binary planting issue in the OpenSSL library, which is an open-source dependency of the NVIDIA GeForce NOW application on Windows.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is a binary planting vulnerability in the application's OpenSSL dependency. This means a malicious actor can place a malicious OpenSSL binary in a location where the application will load it instead of the legitimate one.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. This implies the attacker could gain control over the user's system with elevated rights.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local. A local user (one that has access to the system) can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to place files in a location where the vulnerable application will load the malicious OpenSSL binary. The user must also initiate a process that would cause the vulnerable application to load the malicious binary.

**Summary:**
The NVIDIA GeForce NOW application for Windows is vulnerable to a binary planting attack due to its use of the OpenSSL library. A local attacker can place a malicious OpenSSL library in a specific directory and trigger the application to load it, potentially allowing code execution or privilege escalation. The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.3. The fix is to update to version 2.0.25.119 or later.
